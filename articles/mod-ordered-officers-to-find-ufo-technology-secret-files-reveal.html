      <h2>MoD ordered officers to find UFO technology, secret files reveal</h2>

<p>The British military sought “extraterrestrial” technology in the 1990s after receiving credible intelligence that unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) could outmanoeuvre known human craft, according to previously secret files. The Defence Intelligence Staff (DIS), part of the Ministry of Defence (MoD), was directed to examine UAPs following numerous reports of strange objects in the sky.</p>

<p>This disclosure is significant as it reveals the seriousness with which the MoD treated sightings of UFOs. Current authorities have ceased investigations into UAPs, with no plans to resume them, despite the historical interest in the topic.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Internal memos from the MoD date back to March 4, 1997.</li>
    <li>Thousands of reports of large, silent, low-flying black triangles were recorded in Belgium between November 1989 and April 1990.</li>
    <li>The Rendlesham Forest incident occurred on December 26, 1980, at a US air force base near Woodbridge, Suffolk.</li>
    <li>The DIS was renamed Defence Intelligence in 2009.</li>
    <li>Luke Pollard, Minister for Defence Readiness, stated in December 2024 that the MoD ceased investigating UFOs in 2009.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the MoD began to take reports of UFOs seriously, particularly following extensive sightings in Belgium. On March 4, 1997, an internal memo indicated that the DIS was tasked to explore the implications of UAPs and their potential threat to national security. The memo highlighted the need to consider technology acquisition from these unidentified crafts.</p>

<p>In 2009, the DIS was renamed Defence Intelligence, and investigations into UAPs were officially ceased. By December 2024, Luke Pollard confirmed that no further analysis of UFO sightings was taking place, as the MoD prioritised other defence-related activities.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The reported technology, if true, would represent technology we do not have,” the correspondence from the DIS stated. “No matter the origin, the determination of the technology, and possible acquisition, is a matter for Defence Intelligence Staff.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>Luke Pollard told MPs, “The MoD’s position remains unchanged, which is that, in over 50 years, no sighting reported to the department has indicated the existence of any military threat to the UK.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The interest in UFOs has been present in military and intelligence circles for decades, with various incidents raising questions about national security. The Rendlesham Forest incident and the Belgian sightings are two notable events that have been referenced in discussions about UAPs. Despite the cessation of investigations, the MoD has acknowledged that some reports remain unexplained.</p>

<p>In recent years, there has been a resurgence of public interest in UFOs, spurred by the release of government documents and footage of UAP encounters. However, the MoD's current stance is that there is no credible evidence of a threat posed by these phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As of now, there are no plans for the MoD to reinstate a dedicated team to investigate UFO sightings. The focus remains on other defence-related activities, with the government maintaining its position that no military threat has been identified from reported UAPs.</p>
