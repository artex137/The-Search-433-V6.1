      <h2>James Webb: Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS consists mainly of carbon dioxide</h2>

<p>The James Webb Space Telescope has confirmed that interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS primarily consists of carbon dioxide, along with traces of water and carbon monoxide. This discovery was made during observations conducted in September 2025, as the comet traveled through the Solar System after its discovery in early July.</p>

<p>This finding is significant as it enhances the understanding of comet composition and formation. The James Webb Space Telescope has become a key tool for astronomers, providing detailed data about celestial bodies. The precise chemical makeup of 3I/ATLAS could offer insights into the conditions of the early solar system and the environments in which comets form.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered in early July 2025.</li>
    <li>James Webb Space Telescope conducted observations in September 2025.</li>
    <li>Main component identified as carbon dioxide.</li>
    <li>Water and carbon monoxide also detected.</li>
    <li>Carbon dioxide to water ratio is 8:1, the highest recorded for a comet.</li>
    <li>Ratio of carbon monoxide to water is 1.4, consistent with previous observations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first discovered in early July 2025, generating interest among astronomers worldwide. The James Webb Space Telescope conducted its observations in September 2025, utilizing its NIRSpec spectrograph to analyze the comet's chemical composition. Results indicated a predominance of carbon dioxide and highlighted unusual ratios of various compounds present in the comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The main component is carbon dioxide. This is a significant finding given the unique ratios observed,” said a spokesperson for the James Webb Space Telescope team.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comets are often considered time capsules of the early solar system, preserving clues about the materials that formed planets. The composition of 3I/ATLAS, particularly its high carbon dioxide ratio, stands out when compared to typical solar system comets. Understanding such differences can help scientists refine models of comet formation and evolution.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze the data from the James Webb Space Telescope to further understand the formation processes of 3I/ATLAS and its implications for the study of other interstellar objects.</p>
