      <h2>Is 3I/ATLAS spinning? Viral video sparks fresh curiosity as netizens say ‘never seen anything like this’</h2>

<p>Fresh images and videos of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS have generated significant buzz on social media, with many users questioning whether the comet is “spinning.” The visuals, shared by Ray’s Astrophotography and supported by NASA updates, have reignited public interest in the comet, which is currently passing through the solar system for the first—and only—time. There are no reported injuries or fatalities associated with this phenomenon.</p>

<p>The speculation around 3I/ATLAS has drawn attention from both amateur astronomers and scientific communities. Authorities, including NASA and ESA, have not confirmed any claims of the comet’s rotational motion or other unusual features. The interest highlights the ongoing fascination with interstellar objects and the potential for new discoveries in astronomy.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was first identified on July 1, 2025, by NASA’s ATLAS survey telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile.</li>
    <li>It is only the third interstellar object detected in the solar system, following 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov.</li>
    <li>The comet is travelling at over 210,000 km/h and poses no threat to Earth.</li>
    <li>It passed Mars at a distance of about 29 million kilometres on October 2-3, 2025.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will remain visible in the morning sky through November and December.</li>
    <li>ESA’s JUICE spacecraft is scheduled to observe the comet from November 2 to 25, with data expected in 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2025, as it entered the solar system. On October 2-3, 2025, it made its closest approach to Mars, passing at a distance of approximately 29 million kilometres. Following this, the comet shifted into the pre-dawn sky, becoming visible low on the eastern horizon. Recent viral posts have emerged, speculating about its motion, but these claims have not been verified by scientific authorities.</p>

<p>On October 30, 2025, 3I/ATLAS reached its closest point to the Sun. It is currently visible with a medium-sized telescope and will continue to be observable during early morning hours throughout November and December.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“There is no scientific confirmation of the claims that 3I/ATLAS is spinning. Observations remain unverified,” a NASA spokesperson said.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The comet is traveling too fast for the Sun’s gravity to capture it, confirming its hyperbolic trajectory,” an ESA representative stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is significant as it may contain large quantities of carbon dioxide, similar to icy bodies formed in distant star regions. This provides astronomers a rare opportunity to study materials from another planetary system. The comet is part of a growing interest in interstellar objects, following the discovery of 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA plans to release updated images of 3I/ATLAS during a live event at 3 pm EST on Wednesday. Observations from ESA’s JUICE spacecraft are also expected to yield data starting in 2026, contributing to the ongoing study of this unique interstellar visitor.</p>
