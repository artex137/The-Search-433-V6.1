      <p class="byline">Published 2025-09-04 07:51 UTC</p>

      <h2>3I/ATLAS Comet Approaching Solar System</h2>
<p>An interstellar object known as 3I/ATLAS is hurtling through the Solar System at a speed of <strong>209,214 kilometres per hour</strong>. The comet, which measures nearly <strong>24 kilometres</strong> across, was first officially discovered on July 1, 2023, but has been observed as early as May by NASA's TESS spacecraft.</p>

<h2>Why This Matters</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS is significant as it adds to the growing understanding of interstellar objects, following the earlier discoveries of Oumuamua in 2017 and Borisov’s comet in 2019. Astronomers are using advanced telescopes to study its unusual characteristics, including a high proportion of carbon dioxide in its coma.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Speed: 209,214 kilometres per hour</li>
    <li>Size: Approximately 24 kilometres across</li>
    <li>First official discovery: July 1, 2023</li>
    <li>Initial observations by TESS: May 2023</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun (perihelion): October 29, 2023</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: Following perihelion, date not disclosed</li>
    <li>NASA's Juno spacecraft may intercept near Jupiter: March 2024</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected in May 2023 by TESS, which used image-stacking techniques to reveal the comet's activity at a distance of 6 astronomical units from the Sun. Officially, it was discovered on July 1. In August, NASA's SPHEREx telescope made observations, confirming the presence of a coma rich in carbon dioxide and water. The comet is set to reach its closest point to the Sun on October 29, 2023.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Our observations are compatible with an intrinsically CO2-rich nucleus, which may indicate that 3I/ATLAS contains ices exposed to higher levels of radiation than Solar System comets,” researchers stated. “A low coma H2O gas abundance may also be implied, for example, due to inhibited heat penetration into the nucleus.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object discovered, following Oumuamua and Borisov’s comet. These discoveries have reshaped astronomers’ understanding of the Solar System and the origins of celestial bodies. The study of such objects also raises questions about their potential technological origins, although none have shown evidence of artificial structures or signals to date.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following its perihelion on October 29, 2023, 3I/ATLAS will make its closest approach to Earth before departing the Solar System. NASA's Juno spacecraft could potentially intercept the comet as it passes near Jupiter in March 2024.</p>
