      <h2>UFO witness screamed 'it's coming right for us' after spotting glowing red squares</h2>

<p>The US House of Representatives has heard testimonies on September 9 from multiple witnesses claiming UFO encounters, including a report of a glowing red square sighted in Vandenberg, California, between 2003 and 2005. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in relation to the sightings.</p>

<p>This session, titled 'Transparency Relating to Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP)', underscores ongoing government interest in unidentified aerial phenomena. Committee Chairwoman Anna Paulina Luna has emphasized the need for transparency, stating the government has withheld information from the public for years.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Hearing date: September 9, 2023</li>
    <li>Location: US House of Representatives</li>
    <li>Key witnesses: Jeffrey Nuccetelli, Alexandro Wiggins, Dylan Borland</li>
    <li>Initial sighting date: October 3, 2003</li>
    <li>Number of UFO incidents reported: Five (2003-2005)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 3, 2003, Boeing contractors reported a "massive glowing red square" over missile defense installations in Vandenberg, California. This event is referred to as the "Vandenberg glowing red square event." Witnesses, including security guards, expressed alarm as they observed the object.</p>

<p>On February 15, 2023, US Navy member Alexandro Wiggins reported seeing unidentified flying objects while stationed on the USS Jackson. He described a "self-luminous tic-tac-shaped object" emerging from the ocean, which later joined three other similar objects before accelerating and disappearing.</p>

<p>In 2012, US Air Force veteran Dylan Borland reported witnessing an "approximately 100ft equilateral triangle" take off while on duty. He noted a dynamic material composition and experienced static electricity and a thunderstorm scent in the air.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It is time to give Americans the answers they deserve, which is why I am honored to lead this bipartisan task force that seeks truth and transparency,” said Representative Anna Paulina Luna.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Citizens deserve access to truth that remains hidden and suppressed by stigma and confusion,” said Jeffrey Nuccetelli, a US Air Force veteran.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Declassification and transparency, where possible, are essential,” stated Alexandro Wiggins.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The recent testimonies come amid a growing public and governmental interest in UFOs and UAPs. Last month, astrophysicist Dr. Eric Davis informed a congressional committee that several types of extraterrestrial beings could potentially pilot unidentified vessels. Congressman Eric Burlison confirmed that discussions about these categories of aliens have occurred in confidential briefings.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities are expected to continue investigations into the reported sightings and consider further hearings on UAPs for greater transparency and public awareness.</p>
