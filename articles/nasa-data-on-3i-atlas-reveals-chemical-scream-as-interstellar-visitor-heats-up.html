      <h2>Nasa Data On 3I/ATLAS Reveals 'Chemical Scream' As Interstellar Visitor Heats Up</h2>

<p>Nasa has reported new observations of comet 3I/ATLAS, revealing significant activity on its surface following a close encounter with the Sun. The data, captured by the Gemini North telescope in Hawaii on 26 November 2025 and released in January 2026, shows unusual gas emissions described by scientists as a 'chemical scream'.</p>

<p>This discovery is important as it provides a unique glimpse into materials formed around another star. The findings illustrate how extreme solar heating can awaken ancient, frozen matter as the comet travels through the Solar System.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS observed on 26 November 2025.</li>
  <li>Data released in January 2026.</li>
  <li>Observations made using the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph.</li>
  <li>Previous images showed a reddish tone; latest data shows a green glow.</li>
  <li>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object observed in the Solar System.</li>
  <li>NASA supports instruments and follow-up science through NSF NOIRLab.</li>
  <li>Future surveys expected by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 26 November 2025, the Gemini North telescope captured images of 3I/ATLAS after its close encounter with the Sun. The observations revealed a significant change in the comet's appearance, with a shift from a reddish tone to a clear green glow, indicating increased activity. This data was subsequently released in January 2026.</p>

<p>Scientists have linked the green glow to diatomic carbon, a gas that emits green light when excited. The observations suggest that the comet’s internal heat continues to drive activity, even as it moves away from the Sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We all would have been thrilled to find technosignatures coming from 3I/ATLAS, but they're just not there,” said Benjamin Jacobson-Bell, lead researcher at the University of California, Berkeley. “The absence of signals matched expectations for a natural comet.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Sharing the data gives the public a truly front-row view of our interstellar visitor,” said Bryce Bolin of Eureka Scientific, who led the Gemini observing programme.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object ever observed, following 1I/'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Unlike typical comets that form around the Sun, 3I/ATLAS originated from deep space and will not return. This makes studying it crucial for understanding materials shaped by other star systems and the formation of planets across the galaxy.</p>

<p>Public interest in the comet has led to speculation about potential alien technology. The Green Bank Telescope, through the Breakthrough Listen project, investigated this possibility, ruling out artificial signals.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to track 3I/ATLAS as it exits the Solar System and begins to cool. Delayed outgassing remains a focus, as internal heat may still drive further activity in the comet.</p>
