      <h2>'UFO debris & alien bodies' seen in haunting 22-minute 'Roswell Incident' video quietly uploaded to the national archive</h2>

<p>A 22-minute video titled <em>The Roswell Incident</em> has been uploaded to the National Archives, featuring what some believe to be debris and alien bodies from the 1947 crash in New Mexico. The footage combines still images, motion-controlled camera shots, and excerpts from the published Roswell Report, as well as UFO magazines and books. It opens with the book <em>The Roswell Report: Fact Versus Fiction</em> and concludes with a stark black-and-white shot of a crater filled with metallic debris.</p>

<p>This video has sparked renewed online speculation regarding the infamous incident, which began when a rancher reported scattered debris in July 1947. Authorities investigated the site, leading to claims of extraterrestrial involvement. The U.S. military's previous explanation, asserting the debris was from a weather balloon, has not quelled ongoing debates among enthusiasts and researchers.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Video duration: 22 minutes</li>
    <li>Incident date: July 1947</li>
    <li>Location: Roswell, New Mexico</li>
    <li>Investigation by: U.S. military, concluded in 1994</li>
    <li>Original claim: "flying disc" found</li>
    <li>Official explanation: debris from Project Mogul, a high-altitude balloon program</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 1947, a rancher discovered debris near Roswell, prompting an investigation by Major Jesse Marcel of the U.S. Army Air Forces. Initial reports described the debris as a "flying disc." However, within 24 hours, the military retracted this claim, stating it was a weather balloon.</p>

<p>Decades later, in 1994, the U.S. military confirmed the debris was linked to Project Mogul, a program designed to detect Soviet nuclear tests. Despite this, many ufologists and enthusiasts continue to question the official narrative, maintaining that the incident involved extraterrestrial materials.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    <strong>Mark Lee, UFO expert:</strong> “In my opinion, it’s either a hoax. Just because it’s been added to the National Archives doesn’t give it scientific validation.”
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <strong>Nick Pope, former UFO investigator:</strong> “Roswell is literally the ground zero of the modern UFO mystery. Today’s testing could immediately ascertain whether the UFO was from outer space - or Earth.”
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Roswell incident remains one of the most discussed events in UFO lore. Initial military claims of a "flying disc" have led to decades of speculation and conspiracy theories about government cover-ups regarding extraterrestrial life. The incident has been referenced in numerous books, documentaries, and articles, solidifying its place in popular culture.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the Roswell incident continue among enthusiasts and researchers. The recent video upload may prompt further scrutiny and analysis from both the public and authorities as interest in UFOs and potential extraterrestrial encounters remains high.</p>
