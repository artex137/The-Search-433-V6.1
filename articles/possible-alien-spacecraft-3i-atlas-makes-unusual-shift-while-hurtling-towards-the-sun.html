      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Executes Unusual Maneuver Near the Sun</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has reportedly executed an unusual maneuver while approaching the Sun earlier this week, prompting speculation regarding its nature. Harvard scientist Avi Loeb has cited a report from NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) that indicates the comet displayed “non-gravitational acceleration” during its closest approach, known as perihelion.</p>

<p>This development is significant as it raises questions about the comet's behavior and composition. Authorities at JPL have noted the comet's unexpected trajectories and changes in brightness and color, which may suggest unusual characteristics not typically associated with comets.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS approached its perihelion earlier this week.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb reported findings based on data from NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.</li>
    <li>The comet exhibited “non-gravitational acceleration” and unusual color changes.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object to enter our solar system.</li>
    <li>Loeb has identified nine anomalies associated with 3I/ATLAS.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Earlier this week, Comet 3I/ATLAS approached the Sun and executed a maneuver that caught the attention of scientists. Avi Loeb published a blog post discussing the comet’s behavior, which was based on data from NASA’s JPL. The report indicated that the comet’s trajectory included movements away from the Sun and sideward nudges, which are atypical for comets.</p>

<p>Loeb noted that the comet has been growing brighter and bluer than expected as it nears the Sun, which contrasts with the typical behavior of comets that usually appear red. This anomaly has led to speculation about the presence of an internal engine or other unusual characteristics.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The non-gravitational acceleration could be a result of cometary evaporation or technological propulsion,” said Avi Loeb, discussing the findings from JPL.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object to enter our solar system, following previous objects that have sparked interest among scientists. The unusual characteristics of 3I/ATLAS, including its anti-tail and proximity to other planets, have led to discussions about the possibility of extraterrestrial origins.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun, analyzing its behavior and collecting data to better understand its nature and trajectory.</p>
