      <h2>China's Tianwen 1 Mars probe captures images of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>China's Tianwen 1 Mars orbiter has successfully imaged the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS during its close approach to Mars, from October 1 to October 4, 2023. The China National Space Administration (CNSA) has released images that show the comet's path and distinctive features.</p>

<p>This event is significant as 3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object to enter our solar system, following 'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. International space agencies, including NASA and the European Space Agency, are collaborating to study the comet as it passes through the solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Imaging Dates:</strong> October 1 to October 4, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Mars:</strong> 18 million miles (28.96 million kilometers)</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> 129,800 mph (58 km per second)</li>
    <li><strong>Size:</strong> Approximately 3.5 miles (5.6 km) wide</li>
    <li><strong>Launch of Tianwen 1:</strong> July 2020</li>
    <li><strong>Entry into Mars Orbit:</strong> February 2021</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Tianwen 1 captured images of 3I/ATLAS during its close pass by Mars. The imaging occurred between October 1 and October 4, 2023, when the comet was approximately 18 million miles away. The CNSA published the images, which highlight the comet's nucleus and surrounding coma.</p>

<p>The Tianwen 1 mission has been instrumental in expanding China's capabilities in planetary exploration. Launched in July 2020, the spacecraft entered Mars orbit in February 2021 and successfully deployed the Zhurong rover in May 2021.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Data acquired by a high-resolution camera was received, processed and displayed by a ground-based application system,” said CNSA in a statement on November 5.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “The images clearly show the comet's distinctive features, consisting of a nucleus and a surrounding coma, with a diameter reaching several thousand kilometers,” CNSA added.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The imaging of 3I/ATLAS marks an important milestone in the study of interstellar objects. Previous interstellar visitors, 'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have provided valuable insights into the nature of such celestial bodies. The successful imaging by Tianwen 1 demonstrates China's growing capabilities in space exploration.</p>

<p>Additionally, the observations contribute to ongoing international efforts to understand the origins and characteristics of interstellar comets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its trajectory through the solar system, further observations are expected from Mars and Jupiter probes. The data collected will aid in the ongoing research into interstellar bodies, enhancing our understanding of their composition and behavior.</p>
