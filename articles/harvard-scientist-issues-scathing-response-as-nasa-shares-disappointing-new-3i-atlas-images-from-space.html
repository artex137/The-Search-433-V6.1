      <h2>Harvard scientist issues scathing response as NASA shares disappointing new 3I/ATLAS images from space</h2>

<p>NASA has released new images of Comet 3I/ATLAS, prompting a critical response from Harvard scientist Avi Loeb on November 20, 2023. The images, which have been described as disappointing, show the comet's features but lack the clarity that scientists had hoped for.</p>

<p>This release is significant as it comes during ongoing studies of the comet, which is believed to hold clues about the early solar system. NASA has been monitoring 3I/ATLAS since its discovery, and the latest images are part of an effort to better understand its composition and trajectory.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of image release: November 20, 2023</li>
    <li>Scientist critical of images: Avi Loeb, Harvard University</li>
    <li>Comet name: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>NASA's role: Ongoing monitoring and imaging</li>
    <li>Public response: Disappointment expressed by experts</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first discovered in 2019 and has been under observation by NASA since then. The recent images taken on November 20, 2023, are part of a series of observations aimed at capturing detailed features of the comet.</p>

<p>Avi Loeb has publicly criticized the quality of the images, indicating that they do not meet expectations for such a significant celestial body.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "The images released do not provide the clarity we need to make significant scientific conclusions about 3I/ATLAS." He emphasized the importance of high-quality data in understanding the comet's characteristics.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has garnered attention due to its potential insights into the formation of the solar system. Previous imaging efforts have yielded mixed results, leading to ongoing discussions about the technological capabilities of current space observation tools.</p>

<p>The scientific community has frequently debated the adequacy of imaging technology in capturing detailed data from distant celestial objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA plans to continue monitoring Comet 3I/ATLAS and may attempt additional imaging in the future to improve clarity and detail, as researchers like Loeb continue to advocate for enhanced observational methods.</p>
