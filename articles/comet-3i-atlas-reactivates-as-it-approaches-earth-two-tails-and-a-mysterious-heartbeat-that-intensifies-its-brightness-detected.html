      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Reactivates as It Approaches Earth</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has reactivated as it approaches Earth, with its closest encounter scheduled for December 19, 2025. NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) have obtained new, detailed images of the comet, which was discovered in July and is only the third confirmed interstellar object by scientists. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it allows scientists to study the comet's behavior and characteristics in greater detail. The comet's recent passage near the Sun has increased its brightness and activity, prompting ongoing observations by space agencies. The findings may provide insights into the nature of interstellar objects and their potential impact on the solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered: July 2025</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun: October 29, 2025</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Speed: Approximately 210,000 kilometers per hour</li>
    <li>Distance at closest approach: Approximately 270 million kilometers (170 million miles)</li>
    <li>Observation date of new images: December 3, 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025. It made its closest approach to the Sun on October 29, which increased its activity. NASA and ESA have since captured sharper images, revealing new details about the comet.</p>
<p>The comet is expected to reach its closest point to Earth on December 19, 2025, allowing for optimal observation opportunities.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We not only clearly see the bright halo of gas surrounding the comet, known as the coma, but we also see an indication of two tails,” said a representative from the ESA.</blockquote>
<blockquote>NASA has stated that “3I/ATLAS represents no threat” as it approaches Earth.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable as it is only the third confirmed interstellar object observed by scientists. The comet's behavior, including its "heartbeat" phenomenon, has intrigued researchers and sparked discussions about the nature of such celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth. Observations on December 19 will provide further data on the comet's characteristics and behavior before it exits the solar system.</p>
