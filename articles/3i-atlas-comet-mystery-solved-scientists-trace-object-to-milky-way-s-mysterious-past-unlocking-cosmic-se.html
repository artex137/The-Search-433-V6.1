      <h2>3I/ATLAS Comet Mystery Solved?</h2>

<p>Scientists have traced the interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS to a region of the Milky Way, suggesting it may be a relic from the galaxy's early history. The comet, which is currently passing through our solar system, has been observed by astronomers since late June and confirmed by NASA in July. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to the comet's passage.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it offers insights into the formation of our galaxy and the origins of celestial bodies within it. Researchers believe that understanding the comet's journey could unlock secrets about the early Milky Way and its evolution over billions of years.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first spotted in late June 2023.</li>
    <li>Nasa confirmed its existence in early July 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet is estimated to be between 4.8 to 11.2 kilometers wide.</li>
    <li>It passed Mars on October 3, 2023.</li>
    <li>The closest approach to the Sun is expected on October 30, 2025.</li>
    <li>It will pass Jupiter in March 2026 before leaving the solar system.</li>
    <li>The closest distance to Earth will be about 1.8 astronomical units (approximately 270 million kilometers).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In late June 2023, astronomers first detected Comet 3I/ATLAS. NASA confirmed the comet's status as an interstellar object in early July. The comet then passed Mars on October 3, 2023, and is set to make its closest approach to the Sun on October 30, 2025. Following this, it will continue towards interstellar space, passing Jupiter in March 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We have found that none of the stars in the solar neighborhood can explain the trajectory and high velocity of 3I/ATLAS,” said Xabier Pérez-Couto, lead study author and astrophysics postgraduate student at Spain's Universidade da Coruña.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“If comet 3I/ATLAS did indeed originate from the border of these two disks, it could mean the object is incredibly old — potentially 10 billion years old,” Pérez-Couto added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is only the third known interstellar object to be detected in our solar system, following the discovery of ‘Oumuamua in 2017 and Comet Borisov in 2019. The study of such objects is crucial for understanding the composition and dynamics of other star systems, as well as the early conditions that led to the formation of our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to study Comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun and further investigate its origins. The comet will remain observable until September 2025, after which it will pass too close to the Sun for observations before reappearing in December 2025.</p>
