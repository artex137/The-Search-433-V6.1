      <h2>Trump Orders UFO File Review After Obama Remark Sparks Alien Debate</h2>

<p>President Donald Trump has ordered a review of government files related to Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) in response to renewed political discourse and public interest, particularly following remarks made by former President Barack Obama. The announcement came on February 19, 2026, as federal investigators reported a monthly range of 50 to 100 UAP sightings in the United States.</p>

<p>This review is significant as it reflects ongoing government efforts to address public curiosity about UAPs and the possibility of extraterrestrial life. The Pentagon, NASA, and the intelligence community have stated that there is no verified evidence of alien contact, but the increasing number of reported sightings and public interest have prompted official scrutiny.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>U.S. agencies record 50 to 100 UAP sightings each month.</li>
    <li>Trump announced the file review on February 19, 2026.</li>
    <li>The Pentagon established the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) in July 2022.</li>
    <li>AARO’s mandate covers air, sea, space, and transmedium environments.</li>
    <li>Barack Obama remarked on UAPs in a podcast on February 14, 2026.</li>
    <li>No formal declassification schedule has been publicly released as of now.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In June 2021, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence released a preliminary assessment that reviewed 144 military encounters between 2004 and 2021, finding no evidence of extraterrestrial origin. In July 2022, the Pentagon formed the AARO to manage investigations of UAPs. On February 14, 2026, Barack Obama discussed UAPs in a podcast, stating that while life elsewhere is statistically plausible, he had seen no evidence of alien visits during his presidency. This statement led to increased public attention on the subject.</p>

<p>Following Obama’s remarks, Trump announced on February 19, 2026, that he would direct the Department of Defense and other agencies to identify and release additional records related to UAPs. As of the announcement, no executive order text has been released.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“They’re real,” Obama stated during his podcast. “But I haven’t seen them. They’re not being kept at Area 51.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>Trump commented on Obama’s remarks, saying, “He made a big mistake giving out classified information.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The modern UAP framework began with the preliminary assessment in 2021, which examined military encounters and found that most lacked sufficient data for conclusions. The AARO has since been tasked with investigating UAPs in various environments, and its 2024 Historical Record Report concluded that there is no evidence of government possession of extraterrestrial technology. Public interest in the subject has been fueled by decades of cultural portrayals of aliens and UAPs, though agencies emphasize the lack of credible evidence supporting claims of alien visitation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Agencies are expected to conduct national security reviews before any documents are made public. The declassification process, if initiated, will likely involve structured interagency review to protect sensitive information. As investigations continue, the U.S. government maintains that no verified evidence confirms extraterrestrial contact.</p>
