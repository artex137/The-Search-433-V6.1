      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS passes through solar system</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has been detected moving through the solar system at a speed of approximately 130,000 mph (219,000 km/h), according to NASA. The comet was first observed by NASA's ATLAS telescope on July 1, 2025, and is expected to remain visible to ground-based telescopes until September 2025.</p>

<h2>Why this matters</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS, categorized as an interstellar object, has sparked public interest and concern over potential threats to Earth. However, NASA has confirmed that the comet poses no danger, with its closest approach to Earth expected to be about 1.8 astronomical units (approximately 170 million miles or 270 million kilometers).</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS detected on July 1, 2025, by NASA's ATLAS telescope.</li>
    <li>Travelling at a speed of 130,000 mph (219,000 km/h).</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: approximately 1.8 astronomical units (170 million miles or 270 million kilometers).</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun: October 30, 2025, at about 1.4 astronomical units (130 million miles or 210 million kilometers).</li>
    <li>Nucleus size: estimated between 440 meters (1,444 feet) and 5.6 kilometers (3.5 miles) in diameter.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, NASA's ATLAS telescope detected Comet 3I/ATLAS, marking its entry into the solar system. The comet made its closest approach to Mars on October 3, 2025, allowing for detailed observations by ESA and NASA spacecraft. As it approaches the Sun on October 30, 2025, astronomers will have a unique opportunity to study its interstellar chemistry and physical properties.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“NASA has clarified Comet 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth and will remain far away,” the agency stated. “Its closest distance is more than 2.5 times that between Earth and the Sun.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The interest surrounding 3I/ATLAS has been amplified by social media speculation and misinformation, with various claims suggesting it could be a spacecraft or pose a danger to Earth. NASA and the European Space Agency have both confirmed that the comet is a natural celestial object and does not represent a threat.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As Comet 3I/ATLAS continues its trajectory through the solar system, astronomers will conduct ongoing observations until September 2025. The comet is expected to reappear on the other side of the Sun by early December 2025, allowing for renewed study of its characteristics.</p>
