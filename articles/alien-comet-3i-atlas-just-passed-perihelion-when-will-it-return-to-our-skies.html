      <h2>Alien comet 3I/ATLAS just passed perihelion. When will it return to our skies?</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has passed its closest approach to the Sun, known as perihelion, on October 29, 2025, while travelling through the inner solar system at over 200,000 kilometres per hour. The comet was discovered in early July and is currently en route to interstellar space after a brief visit.</p>

<p>This comet, which likely originated from a distant star, presents a unique opportunity for scientists to study its composition and learn about the environment from which it came. Space agencies, including NASA and the ESA, have captured images of 3I/ATLAS during its close pass to Mars on October 3, 2025, and continue to monitor its behaviour as it moves further from the Sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to Mars:</strong> October 3, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Perihelion:</strong> October 29, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Over 200,000 km/h</li>
    <li><strong>Next Expected Visibility:</strong> October 30 to November 7, 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025. It travelled rapidly through the solar system, passing Mars on October 3, 2025. The comet reached perihelion on October 29, 2025. Observations from various space telescopes have been ongoing, although visibility has been limited due to the comet's position behind the Sun.</p>

<p>During its closest approach to Mars, the ESA's ExoMars TGO successfully captured images of the comet, revealing its coma of gas and dust. The NASA Mars Odyssey and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter also aimed their cameras at the comet, but official updates from these missions have not yet been released.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS has not yet revealed itself in the Mars Express images, partly because these were taken with an exposure time of just 0.5 seconds,” the ESA stated in a press release on October 7.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Despite not being designed to capture something so far away, ExoMars TGO revealed the coma of gas and dust surrounding the icy-rocky nucleus,” the ESA explained.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the latest of several interstellar objects to visit the solar system. Its rapid transit and unique origin provide an opportunity for scientists to study the early conditions of star formation. The comet's brightness and colour shift observed near perihelion suggest changes in its composition, which are of significant interest to researchers.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey, it is expected to reach its brightest visibility between October 30 and November 7, 2025, as it clears the Sun. Observers may find it challenging to spot the comet, but it should be located near Venus in the predawn sky. Further analyses from ongoing missions will be released once the U.S. government shutdown concludes.</p>
