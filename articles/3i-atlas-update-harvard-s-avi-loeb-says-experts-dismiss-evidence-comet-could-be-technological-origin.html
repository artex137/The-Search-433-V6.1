      <h2>3I/ATLAS Update: Harvard's Avi Loeb Says Experts 'Dismiss' Evidence Comet Could Be Technological-Origin</h2>

<p>3I/ATLAS, a comet-like object currently traversing the Solar System, has prompted intense debate among scientists regarding its origins and implications for extraterrestrial life. Dr. Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist, has challenged the prevailing view that the object is simply a comet, arguing instead that it may be a piece of alien technology. His claims have sparked significant discussion within the scientific community.</p>

<p>The ongoing debate surrounding 3I/ATLAS highlights the clash between traditional scientific views and new hypotheses about the cosmos. As researchers analyze the object’s chemical composition, the findings have raised questions about the potential for life beyond Earth. Authorities, including NASA, maintain that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth, with its closest approach scheduled for December 19, 2025.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is currently passing through the Solar System.</li>
    <li>Dr. Avi Loeb is a prominent figure in the discussion, having previously chaired Harvard's astronomy department.</li>
    <li>The object has been found to emit significant amounts of methanol and hydrogen cyanide, critical organic molecules.</li>
    <li>NASA has confirmed that 3I/ATLAS will pass at a distance of 270 million kilometres (168 million miles) from Earth.</li>
    <li>The object is expected to reach its closest point to the Sun on December 19, 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified as an interstellar object, marking it as the third confirmed visitor from outside the Solar System. As it approached the Sun, astronomers conducted chemical analyses using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Chile, revealing high levels of methanol and hydrogen cyanide. Dr. Loeb has since argued that these findings warrant consideration of technological origins.</p>

<p>Despite the chemical evidence, mainstream scientists continue to classify 3I/ATLAS as an unusual comet, supported by observations from the Hubble Space Telescope. The object has displayed typical cometary features, including a coma and tail.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The scientific community is clinging rigidly to traditional explanations, which blinds them to the possibility that this object could be a piece of alien technology,” said Dr. Avi Loeb, emphasizing the need for open-mindedness in scientific inquiry.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “3I/ATLAS poses absolutely zero threat to Earth and will remain safely distant,” a NASA representative stated, reaffirming the agency's position on the object's trajectory.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The debate surrounding 3I/ATLAS is part of a broader discussion about the existence of extraterrestrial life and humanity's place in the universe. Dr. Loeb’s theories challenge the scientific consensus, which prioritizes natural explanations before considering technological ones. This ongoing dialogue reflects a fundamental tension between established scientific paradigms and emerging ideas.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Research on 3I/ATLAS will continue as astronomers gather more data during its passage through the Solar System. The scientific community will likely remain divided on the interpretations of its chemical signatures and physical characteristics as the object approaches the Sun in December 2025.</p>
