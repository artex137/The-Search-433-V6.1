      <h2>3I/ATLAS is Near Mars and Approaches Earth</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS, an interstellar comet, passed close to Mars on 3 October 2025, coming within 30 million kilometres of the planet. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this event.</p>

<p>This close encounter with Mars presents a valuable opportunity for scientists to study the comet and gather data about its composition and trajectory. The comet is expected to make its closest approach to Earth on 19 December 2025, which has garnered significant interest from astronomers and researchers.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS passed 30 million kilometres from Mars on 3 October 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet is travelling at a speed of nearly 219,000 kilometres per hour.</li>
    <li>It will be closest to the Sun at 1.36 AU on 29 October 2025.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will pass approximately 270 million kilometres from Earth on 19 December 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet is on a hyperbolic trajectory and will leave the solar system after its December pass.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 3 October 2025, 3I/ATLAS made its close approach to Mars, allowing for detailed observation by Martian satellites. Following this, on 29 October 2025, the comet will reach its nearest point to the Sun. Finally, it is scheduled to pass by Earth on 19 December 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This is a rare opportunity to study an interstellar object up close,” said a spokesperson for the Mars observation team. “We hope to learn more about its origins and the conditions in other star systems.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable for its unusual, wide orbit, characteristic of objects originating from outside our solar system. Such comets are valuable to scientists as they can provide insights into the formation of other star systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth, scientists will continue to monitor its trajectory and gather data to better understand its composition and the implications for interstellar studies.</p>
