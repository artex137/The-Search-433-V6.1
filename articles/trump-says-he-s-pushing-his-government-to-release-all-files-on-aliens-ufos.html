      <h2>Trump directs release of UFO and alien files</h2>
<p>U.S. President Donald Trump has announced he is directing the Pentagon and other government agencies to release files on extraterrestrials and unidentified flying objects (UFOs) due to “tremendous interest.” Trump made the announcement on his social media platform Truth Social on Thursday, stating that the files will include information on “alien and extraterrestrial life, unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), and unidentified flying objects.” The timeline for the release and the specific contents of the files remain unclear.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Announcement made by Donald Trump on Thursday, date not disclosed.</li>
    <li>Files to be released include information on extraterrestrials and UFOs.</li>
    <li>Trump accused former President Barack Obama of disclosing “classified information” regarding aliens.</li>
    <li>Trump stated he does not have an opinion on the existence of extraterrestrial visitors.</li>
    <li>Public interest in UFOs has surged since 2017, following the release of navy videos by former Pentagon officials.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In May 2022, Congress held its first hearings on UFOs in 50 years, following increased public interest in unidentified flying objects. Reports indicated that some objects observed were likely drones. In July 2022, the Pentagon established the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) to centralize reports of military UFO encounters. An 18-page unclassified report submitted to Congress in June 2024 revealed that service members had made 485 reports of unidentified phenomena, with 118 cases identified as common objects like balloons and birds.</p>

<p>On Saturday prior to Trump's announcement, Barack Obama stated in a podcast that aliens are real but have not been seen and are not kept in Area 51. He emphasized that the vast distances in space make it unlikely that Earth has been visited by extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I don’t know if they’re real or not. I can tell you he gave classified information,” Trump said, referring to Obama. “He’s not supposed to be doing that. He made a big mistake.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Statistically, the universe is so vast that the odds are good there’s life out there,” Obama clarified in an Instagram post, adding, “But the distances between solar systems are so great that the chances we’ve been visited by aliens is low.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Public fascination with UFOs has intensified since 2017, when former Pentagon officials leaked videos of unidentified aerial phenomena to the New York Times. This led to renewed scrutiny and congressional hearings on the topic. In June 2024, a report indicated that military personnel had made numerous reports of unidentified phenomena, although many were later classified as non-exotic objects.</p>

<p>In July 2022, the Pentagon established the AARO to address these reports comprehensively. Meanwhile, a paper from Harvard University suggested that some unidentified phenomena might be explained by advanced civilizations residing in unconventional locations on Earth or the moon.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The Pentagon and related agencies will begin the process of identifying and releasing the requested files, although a specific timeline for this release has not been disclosed.</p>
