      <h2>IAWN launches 2-month mission to track 3I/ATLAS, planetary defense team on alert</h2>

<p>On November 27, 2025, the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) has launched a two-month mission to track the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS as it travels through the solar system. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has confirmed that 3I/ATLAS is a comet, dispelling earlier speculation about its nature. The United Nations (UN) has stated that while the comet poses no direct threat to Earth, ongoing observations are essential.</p>

<p>This mission is significant as it allows IAWN to monitor 3I/ATLAS due to its prolonged visibility from Earth. Authorities plan to use this opportunity to gather more data about the comet and enhance planetary defense strategies. The latest images released by NASA have confirmed the object's cometary status, prompting a coordinated effort among global space agencies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date:</strong> November 27, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Object:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Agencies involved:</strong> IAWN, NASA, UN</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery date:</strong> July 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Status:</strong> No direct threat to Earth</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first discovered in July 2025. Following its discovery, NASA conducted observations and confirmed its identity as a comet shortly before the IAWN mission launch on November 27, 2025. The UN has since emphasized the importance of tracking the object due to its unique characteristics.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Amit Kshatriya, a senior official at NASA, stated, “We very much want to find signs of life in the universe... but 3I/ATLAS is a comet.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Dr. Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist, expressed skepticism regarding NASA's confirmation, writing on Medium, “The trajectory of the space object suggests that it might deploy satellites around Jupiter for surveillance and intelligence gathering.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The ongoing mission reflects IAWN's commitment to planetary defense and the monitoring of near-Earth objects. Previous missions have focused on identifying potential threats to Earth, and 3I/ATLAS presents a unique case due to its interstellar origin.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>IAWN will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS over the next two months, gathering data to enhance understanding of comets and their trajectories. Further observations and analyses are expected from NASA and other participating agencies.</p>
