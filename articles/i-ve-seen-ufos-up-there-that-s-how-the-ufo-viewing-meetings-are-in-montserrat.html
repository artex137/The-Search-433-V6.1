      <h2>UFO Viewing Meetings Draw Enthusiasts to Montserrat</h2>

<p>Every 11th of the month, dozens of people gather at Montserrat, a mountain in Catalonia, to search for unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The meetings take place at nightfall, attracting ufology enthusiasts, believers, and the curious alike.</p>

<p>This event has become a unique pilgrimage for many, offering a blend of spiritual and extraterrestrial exploration. Participants hope to witness something extraordinary and share stories about their experiences. The Hotel Bruc serves as the starting point for these gatherings, where conversations about past sightings and theories about extraterrestrial life abound.</p>
