      <h2>Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS's Tail Appears To Have Changed Direction, Nordic Optical Telescope Finds</h2>

<p>New observations from the Nordic Optical Telescope in the Canary Islands, Spain, indicate that the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has experienced a change in the direction of its tail, which now predominantly points away from the Sun. The discovery was made on July 1, when astronomers from the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) first identified the object as it traveled through the Solar System.</p>

<p>This finding is significant as it may provide insights into the object's characteristics and origin, which is believed to be a 10-billion-year-old time capsule from an earlier age of the universe. Astronomers are currently monitoring 3I/ATLAS closely to better understand its behavior and the implications of its unusual tail structure.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered on July 1, 2023, by ATLAS astronomers.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object, following 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov.</li>
    <li>Observations have noted a change from a Sun-facing dust fan to an anti-solar dust tail.</li>
    <li>Comet has lost approximately 2 million tons of mass since July.</li>
    <li>The object is expected to be in view again in December 2023.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2023, astronomers at ATLAS observed 3I/ATLAS moving through the Solar System. Following its discovery, they noted several unusual features of the comet. By September, the observations confirmed that the anti-tail had developed into a tail. The change in tail direction was attributed to the effects of solar radiation and the comet's unique composition.</p>

<p>As the comet approached the Sun, it was observed that the tail morphology transitioned, leading to the current observations of the anti-solar tail. The object has been tracked closely to study its mass loss and activity as it nears perihelion.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The morphology of the comet changes from a Sun-facing dust fan in the early July observations to one dominated by an anti-solar dust tail at later dates,” researchers noted in their findings.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Observations of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS at 3.8 au show an elongated coma similar to a cometary tail but pointing in the direction of the Sun,” stated a preprint paper by Harvard astronomers Avi Loeb and Eric Keto.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Anti-tails are rare phenomena observed in comets. While they can be optical illusions, the current observations suggest that 3I/ATLAS's anti-tail is a true feature of the comet. Historical observations of anti-tails date back to at least 1974 with Comet Kohoutek. This makes the current findings noteworthy in the study of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to observe 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun, with the next observations expected in December 2023. These studies aim to further explore the object's properties and its journey through the Solar System.</p>
