      <h2>3I/ATLAS is thought to be 7 billion years old</h2>

<p>NASA has reported that 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar comet, is believed to be approximately <strong>7 billion years old</strong>, making it the oldest comet observed to date. This finding marks a significant milestone in the study of celestial bodies.</p>

<p>The age of 3I/ATLAS, which predates the Sun, highlights the importance of understanding the formation and evolution of comets within the Solar System and beyond. NASA has utilized the Europa Clipper spacecraft, launched in October 2024, to capture images of the comet, which is currently traveling through the inner Solar System. These observations are expected to enhance scientific knowledge regarding the origins and composition of such ancient celestial objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Estimated Age:</strong> 7 billion years</li>
    <li><strong>NASA Mission:</strong> Europa Clipper launched in October 2024</li>
    <li><strong>Observation Distance:</strong> Approximately 164 million kilometers</li>
    <li><strong>Observation Time:</strong> Approximately seven hours</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>NASA's monitoring of 3I/ATLAS has followed a structured approach:</p>
<p>In October 2024, the Europa Clipper spacecraft was launched with the aim of studying Jupiter's moon Europa. During its mission, the spacecraft has focused its cameras on 3I/ATLAS, capturing unique images as the comet travels through the inner Solar System. The observation period lasted approximately seven hours, during which onboard sensors gathered data on the dynamics of the comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The existence of 3I/ATLAS indicates that comets are shaped not only by their dynamics within the Solar System but also by their interactions with material from neighboring interstellar regions,” NASA stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS is significant as it provides insights into the long-term evolution of comets and their formation in the interstellar medium. Previous studies have indicated that comets can reveal information about the early Solar System and the materials present during its formation. This observation of 3I/ATLAS illustrates the ongoing advancements in astronomical technology and observation techniques.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Future missions will require advanced sensors and improved data processing techniques to study objects like 3I/ATLAS. NASA aims to develop algorithms that enhance image resolution and analyze the surface composition of such comets. International cooperation will be essential in these efforts, promoting comprehensive plans for future missions and data sharing.</p>
