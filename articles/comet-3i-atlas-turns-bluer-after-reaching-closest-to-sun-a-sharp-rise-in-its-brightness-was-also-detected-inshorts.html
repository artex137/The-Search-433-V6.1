      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS turns bluer after reaching closest to Sun</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has turned bluer after reaching its closest point to the Sun on 29 October 2025. Data from the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) indicated a sharp rise in the comet's brightness due to strong gas emissions during its perihelion.</p>

<p>This phenomenon is significant as it challenges existing understandings of comet behaviour. Normally, dust particles in comets scatter sunlight, causing a reddening effect. However, the unusual gas emissions from 3I/ATLAS have overpowered this effect, resulting in its striking blue appearance.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS reached perihelion on 29 October 2025.</li>
    <li>LASCO data revealed changes in the comet's hue.</li>
    <li>Gas emissions caused the comet to appear blue instead of red.</li>
    <li>This is an unexpected observation, according to scientists.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 29 October 2025, 3I/ATLAS reached its closest point to the Sun, marking its perihelion. Observations from LASCO indicated a significant change in the comet's brightness and colour.</p>
<p>Following this event, scientists have been analysing the data to understand the implications of the gas emissions that caused the comet to turn blue.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The sudden changes observed in 3I/ATLAS are very surprising,” said a Harvard scientist. “Such behaviour has not been seen before in other comets.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the first known interstellar comet, discovered in 2019. Its previous observations have provided insights into the composition and behaviour of comets. The current changes expand the understanding of how comets can behave under varying conditions.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists are expected to continue monitoring 3I/ATLAS to gather more data on its behaviour and the implications of its blue hue. Further analysis may help clarify the processes behind the gas emissions observed.</p>
