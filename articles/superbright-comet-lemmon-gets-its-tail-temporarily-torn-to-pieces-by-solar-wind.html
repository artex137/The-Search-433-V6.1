      <h2>Superbright Comet Lemmon Experiences Tail Disruption Due to Solar Wind</h2>

<p>Comet Lemmon (C/2025 A6) has experienced a temporary disruption of its tail due to a strong gust of solar wind, just three days before its closest approach to Earth on Tuesday, October 21. Astrophotographer Petr Horálek captured a striking image of the comet's shredded tail from Lake Seč in Czechia on the night of Saturday, October 18, according to Spaceweather.com.</p>

<p>This incident highlights the dynamic interactions between comets and solar activity. As Comet Lemmon nears Earth, it has become more visible, with an apparent magnitude of 4, making it observable to the naked eye. Authorities and astronomers are monitoring the comet as it approaches its perihelion on November 8, when it will be closest to the sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet Lemmon's closest approach to Earth is on October 21, 2023.</li>
    <li>It will come within 56 million miles (90 million kilometers) of Earth.</li>
    <li>The tail disruption occurred on October 18, 2023.</li>
    <li>Astrophotographer Petr Horálek took the photograph from Lake Seč, Czechia.</li>
    <li>Comet Lemmon has an apparent magnitude of 4.</li>
    <li>The comet was discovered on January 3, 2023, at Mt. Lemmon SkyCenter in Arizona.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On January 3, 2023, researchers at the Mt. Lemmon SkyCenter discovered Comet Lemmon. On October 4, 2023, the comet experienced a minor disconnection event. On October 18, 2023, the comet's tail was temporarily shredded by a strong gust of solar wind, which was photographed by Petr Horálek. The comet is set to make its closest approach to Earth on October 21, 2023, before reaching perihelion on November 8, 2023.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This type of rippling along the tail is not uncommon among major comets, especially as they approach the sun,” said a representative from Space.com.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is not the first time Comet Lemmon has experienced tail disruptions. It was also affected by a strong solar gust in late September 2023. The comet's tail likely returned to normal shortly after each disruption, as seen in past events.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As Comet Lemmon approaches its closest point to Earth and the sun, astronomers will continue to monitor its visibility and behavior in the night sky. Observers in the Northern Hemisphere can see it in the northwestern sky shortly after sunset.</p>
