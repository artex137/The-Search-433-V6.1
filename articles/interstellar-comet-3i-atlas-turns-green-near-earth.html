      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Turns Green Near Earth</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has entered a highly active phase as it travels through the inner solar system, drawing scientific attention due to its rapid brightening and unusual green glow. The comet, which originates beyond our solar system, has shown significant changes in its chemical and physical composition since its close solar approach in late October.</p>

<p>This development is important as it offers rare insights into material formed around distant stars. Scientists are closely monitoring the comet's behavior and changes to better understand its composition and the implications for studying other star systems.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is currently travelling on a hyperbolic orbit at approximately <strong>210,000 km/h</strong>.</li>
    <li>It is the third confirmed interstellar object detected, following 1I/‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov.</li>
    <li>The comet's closest approach to Earth occurs at about <strong>270 million kilometres</strong>.</li>
    <li>The green glow is produced by diatomic carbon (C₂) molecules released from the comet’s surface.</li>
    <li>Recent observations indicate a shift in the comet's composition since pre-perihelion monitoring.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In late October, astronomers observed a distinct greenish hue emerging from the comet's coma after its close solar approach. This color change is attributed to the release of diatomic carbon molecules during the sublimation of frozen gases on the comet's surface.</p>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS warmed, ice and dust within its nucleus vaporized, leading to the formation of a bright coma and an elongated tail. Multi-filter observations have indicated changes in the comet's composition, suggesting that fresh material is being exposed.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The green glow signals chemical activity, which is a common phenomenon in solar system comets but unexpected for 3I/ATLAS,” scientists have stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable not only for its interstellar origin but also for its size and age. It is believed to be one of the largest and oldest interstellar bodies observed, preserving material from early star-forming environments. This comet adds to the understanding of how planetary materials form across the galaxy.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Continued global observations of 3I/ATLAS will aim to refine estimates of its size, structure, and composition. Scientists expect that further outbursts may occur in the coming days as the comet continues to respond to solar heating.</p>
