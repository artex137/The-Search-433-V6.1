      <h2>80 Years of Cover Up: UFO Files Exposed</h2>

<p>A new documentary titled <strong>The Age of Disclosure</strong> has revealed claims of government concealment of unidentified aerial phenomena over the past 80 years. The film includes testimonies from 34 former government, military, and intelligence officials, asserting that non-human phenomena have been investigated and deliberately hidden from the public.</p>

<p>The documentary, released on 22 November 2025, has generated significant attention due to its explosive revelations. Filmmakers have compiled interviews, declassified documents, and expert analyses that suggest a long history of disinformation campaigns and classified programs aimed at controlling public perception of unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The implications of these claims raise questions about transparency and national security.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Documentary title: <strong>The Age of Disclosure</strong></li>
  <li>Release date: 22 November 2025</li>
  <li>Number of officials interviewed: 34</li>
  <li>Key contributors: Luis Elizondo and Jay Stratton</li>
  <li>Duration of alleged concealment: over 80 years</li>
  <li>Key locations of sightings: nuclear facilities, missile silos, and submarine bases</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Over the years, numerous reports of unexplained aerial phenomena have surfaced from various credible sources, including pilots and military personnel. The documentary presents these accounts as part of a larger narrative of concealment.</p>
<p>Filmmakers argue that the concealment has involved strategic secrecy and disinformation, suggesting that governments may be using recovered extraterrestrial technology for advanced military applications.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“For way too long, the public has been lied to and misled by a heavily financed disinformation campaign,” said Farah, a contributor to the documentary.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“We have encountered craft defying known physics,” stated Luis Elizondo, former head of the Pentagon’s Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“I have personally observed non-human craft and non-human beings,” said Jay Stratton, former leader of the UAP Task Force.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The documentary positions itself within a broader history of UFO sightings and government secrecy. Previous incidents have often been dismissed or ridiculed, contributing to a culture of skepticism surrounding the topic. The film argues that this pattern of silence has been intentional, with significant implications for public understanding and national security.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the documentary raises awareness about the potential concealment of UFO-related information, it may prompt further investigations into these claims. The public and authorities alike are now faced with questions regarding transparency and what, if any, further disclosures might emerge.</p>
