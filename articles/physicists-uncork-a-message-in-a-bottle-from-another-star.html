      <h2>Physicists uncork a message in a bottle from another star</h2>

<p>A team of scientists from Auburn University has detected water’s ultraviolet fingerprint in interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS during observations made in July and August 2025 using NASA’s Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory.</p>

<p>This discovery marks a significant advancement in understanding the evolution of interstellar comets. By detecting hydroxyl (OH) gas, a chemical by-product of water, researchers can compare 3I/ATLAS to solar-system comets for the first time. This comparison could provide insights into the chemistry of planetary systems beyond our own, as well as the conditions that shape the building blocks of life.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Designation:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Observation Dates:</strong> July and August 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Water Loss Rate:</strong> Approximately 40 kilograms per second</li>
    <li><strong>Telescope Used:</strong> NASA’s Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory</li>
    <li><strong>Significance:</strong> First detection of hydroxyl gas from an interstellar comet</li>
    <li><strong>Future Observability:</strong> Will be observable again after mid-November 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July and August 2025, astronomers from Auburn University used NASA’s Swift Observatory to study comet 3I/ATLAS. During this period, they detected hydroxyl gas, indicating the presence of water vapor escaping from the comet. This finding is crucial for comparing the comet to solar-system counterparts.</p>
<p>3I/ATLAS was designated as an interstellar comet after it passed through our solar system, representing only the third such comet identified to date. The comet's activity was particularly notable because it was observed at a distance nearly three times farther from the Sun than Earth, where most solar-system comets typically show little activity.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “When we detect water—or even its faint ultraviolet echo, OH—from an interstellar comet, we’re reading a note from another planetary system,” said <strong>Dennis Bodewits</strong>, professor of physics at Auburn. “It tells us that the ingredients for life’s chemistry are not unique to our own.”
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “Every interstellar comet so far has been a surprise,” added <strong>Zexi Xing</strong>, postdoctoral researcher and lead author of the study. “‘Oumuamua was dry, Borisov was rich in carbon monoxide, and now ATLAS is giving up water at a distance where we didn’t expect it. Each one is rewriting what we thought we knew about how planets and comets form around stars.”
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This discovery is part of a growing body of research on interstellar comets, which have revealed diverse chemical compositions. Previous comets, such as ‘Oumuamua and Borisov, exhibited varying characteristics, indicating that the materials forming planets and comets can differ significantly across star systems.</p>
<p>The detection of water in 3I/ATLAS adds to the understanding of how these celestial bodies evolve and interact with their environments, highlighting the complexities of planetary formation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS will be monitored again after mid-November 2025, providing further opportunities to study its activity and the implications for interstellar chemistry. The findings have been published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.</p>
