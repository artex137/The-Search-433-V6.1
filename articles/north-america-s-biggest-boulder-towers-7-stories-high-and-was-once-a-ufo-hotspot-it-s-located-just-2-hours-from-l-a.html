<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Giant Rock was first documented by explorers in the early 20th century. In the 1930s, Frank Critzer moved to the area with his family and dug an underground home on the north side of the rock. In the early 1950s, following the Roswell incident, George Van Tassel began holding weekly meditation sessions at Critzer’s former home, claiming to receive telepathic messages from extraterrestrial beings.</p>
<p>In 1953, these gatherings led to the organization of the first Giant Rock UFO convention, which grew significantly by 1959, attracting over 11,000 attendees. The events included sharing experiences from contactees and discussions about advanced technologies purportedly shared by aliens.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Giant Rock is a natural cone of receptivity,” said George Van Tassel in his book <em>I Rode a Flying Saucer</em>. “It has become a place of worship and gathering for many.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Giant Rock has been a focal point for UFO enthusiasts since the 1950s, reflecting a broader trend of interest in extraterrestrial life during that era. The gatherings at Giant Rock included meditation sessions and conversations about technologies supposedly imparted by aliens, making it a significant cultural landmark.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigation into the ongoing cultural significance of Giant Rock continues, with mindfulness activities like sound baths held at the nearby Integratron, a structure built by Van Tassel that remains operational today.</p>
