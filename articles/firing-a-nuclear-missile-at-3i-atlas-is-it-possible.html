      <h2>Firing a Nuclear Missile at Comet 3I/ATLAS: Is It Possible?</h2>

<p>A recent report has stated that launching a nuclear missile from Earth to intercept the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is currently beyond our technical capabilities. The report, cited by Rokna, highlights the comet's extraordinary speed of approximately 58 km/s and the limited time available for interception. No injuries or fatalities have been reported related to this inquiry.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as it raises questions about our ability to respond to potential threats from space. However, authorities have noted that 3I/ATLAS poses no danger to Earth. International laws, including the Outer Space Treaty, prohibit deploying nuclear weapons in space except under extreme circumstances, which do not apply in this case. The scientific community is focused on studying 3I/ATLAS, which offers a unique opportunity to learn about materials from beyond our solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was detected on July 1, 2025, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Chile.</li>
    <li>The comet travels at a speed of approximately 58 km/s.</li>
    <li>Its closest approach to Earth is expected on December 19, 2025, at a distance of 1.8 AU.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is estimated to have a nucleus diameter between 0.3 km and 5.6 km.</li>
    <li>The comet's perihelion occurred on October 29-30, 2025, at a distance of 1.356 AU from the Sun.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS entered the solar system with an incoming velocity of 58 km/s. It was detected on July 1, 2025, and has since been the subject of scientific interest. The comet's closest approach to Earth is scheduled for December 19, 2025.</p>
<p>Historical context is provided by NASA's DART mission in 2022, which required over two years of preparation to impact an asteroid. The short time frame available for a potential interception of 3I/ATLAS, roughly 48 days from November 1 to December 19, poses significant challenges.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Even if such a mission were theoretically achievable, international law forbids deploying nuclear weapons in space except under extreme planetary defense circumstances,” the report states.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Attempting to destroy or deflect it would be both scientifically wasteful and unnecessarily risky,” it adds, emphasizing the importance of studying 3I/ATLAS instead.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object to visit our solar system, following ‘Oumuamua in 2017 and Borisov in 2019. Its composition, including ices and rocky material, provides insight into extrasolar chemistry. The scientific community prioritizes missions that can study the comet rather than engage in destructive measures.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth. There are no plans for interception, and the focus remains on scientific exploration of the comet's potential to reveal information about the early solar system.</p>
