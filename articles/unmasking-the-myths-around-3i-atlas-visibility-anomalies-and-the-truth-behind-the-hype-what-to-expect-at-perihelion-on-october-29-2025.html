      <h2>Unmasking the myths around 3I/ATLAS – visibility, 'anomalies', and the truth behind the hype: What to expect at perihelion on October 29, 2025</h2>

<p>3I/ATLAS, the third confirmed interstellar comet, has generated significant public interest and controversy since its discovery on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile. Scheduled to reach its perihelion, or closest approach to the Sun, on October 29, 2025, at 11:36 UTC, the comet is expected to travel at a speed of approximately 68 km/s.</p>

<p>This event is noteworthy due to the comet's unique hyperbolic trajectory, which distinguishes it from typical solar system comets. Authorities are addressing misinformation surrounding its visibility and behavior, which some claim are “anomalous.” Mainstream astronomy attributes these claims to natural phenomena rather than artificial origins.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovery date:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Perihelion date:</strong> October 29, 2025, at 11:36 UTC</li>
    <li><strong>Distance at perihelion:</strong> 1.356 AU from the Sun</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> 68 km/s at perihelion</li>
    <li><strong>Diameter:</strong> 14-20 km</li>
    <li><strong>Initial visibility:</strong> October 25, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Magnitude on October 25:</strong> ~15</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has followed a specific sequence of events leading up to its perihelion:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>October 21, 2025:</strong> The comet reached solar conjunction, becoming temporarily unobservable from Earth due to glare.</li>
    <li><strong>October 25, 2025:</strong> Independent observers reported visibility of 3I/ATLAS in the Virgo constellation, with a magnitude of 15.00.</li>
    <li><strong>October 29, 2025:</strong> The comet is expected to reach its perihelion, allowing for optimal observation conditions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Claims of a ‘lie’ about the comet’s visibility ignore the standard geometry of celestial objects,” said a spokesperson from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Most of the observed behavior can be explained by natural cometary outgassing,” noted an astronomer specializing in interstellar objects.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The controversy surrounding 3I/ATLAS has been fueled by social media speculation, particularly regarding its alleged artificiality. Previous interstellar objects, like 2I/Borisov, have exhibited similar behaviors attributed to natural processes. The ongoing discussion reflects a broader interest in the search for extraterrestrial life and the monitoring of interstellar phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches perihelion, astronomers will continue to monitor its trajectory and brightness. No evidence has emerged to support claims of artificial control or manipulation, and upcoming observations are expected to clarify its natural behavior further.</p>
