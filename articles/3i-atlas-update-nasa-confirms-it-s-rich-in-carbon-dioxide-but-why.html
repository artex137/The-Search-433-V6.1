      <h2>3I/ATLAS Update: NASA Confirms It's Rich in Carbon Dioxide—But Why?</h2>

<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has been confirmed by NASA to have a high concentration of carbon dioxide, according to recent observations made by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and SPHEREx. The findings, released on 6 August 2025, reveal that the object’s coma exhibits a CO₂-to-H₂O mixing ratio of approximately 8:1, one of the highest ratios ever recorded for a comet.</p>

<p>This discovery has prompted scientists to rethink their understanding of comet formation. The unusual chemical composition of 3I/ATLAS raises questions about its origins and the processes that led to its formation. Observations indicate that 3I/ATLAS may have formed in a region with different conditions than typical Solar System comets, potentially leading to a unique evolutionary path.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>CO₂-to-H₂O mixing ratio: approximately 8:1</li>
    <li>Date of observation: 6 August 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from the Sun at closest approach: about 1.4 AU (roughly 210 million kilometres)</li>
    <li>CO₂ gas cloud extends at least 348,000 km from the nucleus</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 6 August 2025, the James Webb Space Telescope and SPHEREx conducted observations of 3I/ATLAS, revealing its unusual carbon dioxide-rich composition. The findings indicate that the object has a CO₂-to-H₂O mixing ratio of about 8.0 ± 1.0, making it a significant outlier among known comets.</p>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches its closest point to the Sun on 30 October 2025, scientists are using the combined observational power of ground-based and space telescopes to further investigate its unique characteristics and origins.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“An intrinsically CO₂-rich nucleus may indicate that 3I/ATLAS contains ices exposed to higher levels of radiation than Solar System comets, or that it formed close to the CO₂ ice line in its parent protoplanetary disc,” researchers stated following the observations.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Typically, comets in our Solar System outgas water, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide in varying proportions as they approach the Sun. The high CO₂ ratio observed in 3I/ATLAS suggests a markedly different history from that of these typical comets. This finding may lead to a reassessment of how volatile ices form and evolve across the galaxy.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey through interstellar space, scientists will maintain their observations to uncover its mysteries. The data collected may help redefine our understanding of planetary formation and the diversity of cometary chemistry.</p>
