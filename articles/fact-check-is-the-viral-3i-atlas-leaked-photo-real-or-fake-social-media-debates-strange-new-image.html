      <h2>Fact Check: Is the viral 3I/Atlas “leaked photo” real or fake? Social media debates strange new image</h2>

<p>A photo claiming to show the nucleus of comet 3I/Atlas has gone viral on social media platforms X and Instagram, sparking debate about its authenticity. The image, posted by the account UFO mania, depicts a sharp, bullet-shaped comet nucleus with glowing details, but experts and NASA have dismissed it as likely fake.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as it highlights ongoing concerns regarding misinformation in astronomy. Authorities, including NASA, have reiterated that the actual images of 3I/Atlas remain low-resolution and do not support the claims made in the viral photo. The agency has stated that current telescopes cannot resolve the comet's solid core due to its distance from Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>NASA has confirmed that 3I/Atlas will not come closer than <strong>270 million kilometers</strong> (170 million miles) to Earth.</li>
    <li>The comet's nucleus is approximately <strong>3 kilometers</strong> (2 miles) in size.</li>
    <li>NASA's Hubble telescope has not directly observed the nucleus of 3I/Atlas.</li>
    <li>The viral photo lacks source data and does not match official NASA imagery.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On August 7, 2025, NASA released a report stating that the nucleus of 3I/Atlas cannot be directly seen, even by Hubble. This report highlighted the limitations of current observations.</p>
<p>On November 2025, NASA confirmed there is no danger to Earth from the comet, which will remain at a safe distance.</p>
<p>On September 11, 2025, The Guardian published comments from NASA's small-bodies lead scientist Tom Statler, who affirmed that 3I/Atlas behaves like a typical comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “It looks like a comet. It does comet things. It very, very strongly resembles, in just about every way, the comets that we know.” 
    <cite>— Tom Statler, NASA small-bodies lead scientist</cite>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “No one knows where the comet came from. It’s like glimpsing a rifle bullet for a thousandth of a second.” 
    <cite>— David Jewitt, Hubble team member</cite>
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous incidents of misinformation in astronomy have led to widespread speculation about celestial bodies. The spread of unverified images and claims often fuels public confusion and distrust in scientific data. NASA has faced similar challenges with other comets in the past, where viral images have not matched official records.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to monitor 3I/Atlas and provide updates based on new observations. The agency has encouraged the public to rely on official sources for accurate information regarding the comet.</p>
