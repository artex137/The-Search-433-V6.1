      <h2>ESA redirects Mars and solar spacecraft to study rare interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it vanishes behind the Sun</h2>

<p>The European Space Agency (ESA) has repurposed its fleet of spacecraft around Mars and the Sun to observe 3I/ATLAS, a rare interstellar comet, as it moves out of view from Earth during a three-month solar conjunction. The comet will remain invisible to ground telescopes from late September until December 2025, making spacecraft observations critical, according to ESA.</p>

<p>This event is significant because 3I/ATLAS is only the third known interstellar visitor to our Solar System, and its hyperbolic orbit confirms that it came from beyond the Sun's gravitational influence. ESA has tasked Mars Express and the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter to observe the comet during its close pass by Mars on October 3, 2025, when it will come within 30 million kilometres of the planet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>3I/ATLAS will be invisible to ground telescopes from late September 2023 until December 2025.</li>
  <li>The comet will pass within 30 million kilometres of Mars on October 3, 2025.</li>
  <li>ESA's Mars Express and ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter will observe the comet during this time.</li>
  <li>Other spacecraft, including Solar Orbiter and SOHO, will also monitor the comet.</li>
  <li>NASA's Parker Solar Probe and STEREO-A may contribute to the observations.</li>
  <li>ESA's JUICE spacecraft will attempt observations in November when the comet is 64 million kilometres away.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified as an interstellar object in 2023. As it approached the Sun, astronomers predicted it would become invisible to Earth-based observations due to solar conjunction.</p>

<p>In response, ESA announced its plans to redirect Mars orbiters and other spacecraft to track the comet. The Mars Express and ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter have been designated to observe the comet during its close pass by Mars in October 2025.</p>

<p>As it continues its journey through the Solar System, other spacecraft will join the effort to gather data on 3I/ATLAS, with significant observations expected in late 2023 and 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Even if the nucleus is too small to resolve, we can still learn from its coma and tail,” said project scientist Colin Wilson from ESA.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable for being only the third interstellar object to cross our Solar System, following 1I/'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Its composition has generated interest, with early results from the James Webb Space Telescope suggesting it has a higher carbon dioxide content than most comets.</p>

<p>The comet's unusual optical behaviour has also sparked debate among astronomers. Some theories propose that its acceleration and mass may indicate an artificial origin, although NASA has dismissed these claims as explainable by natural processes.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS remains hidden behind the Sun, spacecraft will continue to monitor it. Ground telescopes will resume tracking the comet once it re-emerges in December 2025. ESA aims to gather data that will enhance understanding of how objects form around other stars.</p>
