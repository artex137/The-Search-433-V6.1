      <h2>3I/ATLAS Fuels Speculation on Alien Life</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has sparked renewed interest in the possibility of extraterrestrial life, according to various scientists. The comet is set to approach the Solar System between 27 November 2025 and 27 January 2026, but it does not pose a threat to Earth.</p>

<p>This renewed focus on 3I/ATLAS has led to discussions about the 'Zoo Hypothesis,' a theory suggesting that advanced alien civilizations may be observing humanity without making contact. Experts from various fields are exploring the implications of this theory, highlighting the ongoing search for potential life beyond Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS will approach the Solar System between 27 November 2025 and 27 January 2026.</li>
    <li>The comet is not expected to pose a threat to Earth.</li>
    <li>The International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) is tracking the comet's orbit.</li>
    <li>The Zoo Hypothesis was first proposed in 1973 by MIT radio astronomer John Ball.</li>
    <li>The hypothesis suggests aliens may view Earth as a zoo, observing humanity without interference.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 1973, John Ball introduced the Zoo Hypothesis, linking it to the Fermi Paradox, which questions why we have not yet encountered extraterrestrial life despite the vastness of the universe.</p>

<p>Recently, the approach of 3I/ATLAS has reignited discussions about the implications of this hypothesis. The IAWN is actively tracking the comet's movements to gather data that could aid in the detection of future threats from space.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It also just seems implausible because it requires a vast galactic conspiracy. When was the last time anybody worked together to keep a secret?”</blockquote>
<p>- Daniel Whiteson, particle physicist</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Zoo Hypothesis provides an alternative perspective on humanity's search for extraterrestrial life. While some scientists argue that advanced civilizations may exist, others caution against anthropocentrism, the belief that humans are the center of cosmic concerns.</p>

<p>Astrophysicists William I. Newman and Carl Sagan have noted that predicting the goals of an alien civilization is inherently difficult, but such speculations can help visualize the challenges of interstellar colonization.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The IAWN will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Solar System, gathering data that may be crucial for future asteroid detection and tracking efforts.</p>
