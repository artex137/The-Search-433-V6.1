      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS shedding water like crazy — and that's not normal</h2>

<p>Researchers have detected that interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is releasing water as it approaches the Sun, according to a study published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters. This discovery marks a significant finding, as it may provide insights into the composition of 3I/ATLAS and the formation of extraterrestrial bodies outside of the solar system.</p>

<p>The presence of water in 3I/ATLAS suggests the potential for supporting life. Researchers have noted that this release of water is occurring at a distance from the Sun where solar system comets typically show little activity. The analysis was conducted using observations from NASA's Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, which detected traces of hydroxyl (OH) gas, a chemical indicator of water.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is releasing water at a rate of <strong>0.04 tonnes per second</strong>.</li>
    <li>OH gas was detected while the comet was positioned <strong>three times farther from the Sun than Earth</strong>.</li>
    <li>The study was published in <strong>The Astrophysical Journal Letters</strong>.</li>
    <li>Observations were conducted using NASA's <strong>Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory</strong>.</li>
    <li>Previous interstellar comets included <strong>'Oumuamua</strong> (dry) and <strong>Borisov</strong> (rich in carbon monoxide).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Researchers have gathered new insights on 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun. The James Webb Space Telescope provided initial observations that indicated a high carbon dioxide to water ratio. Following this, the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory detected traces of hydroxyl gas, marking a breakthrough in understanding the comet's activity.</p>

<p>As the comet moves closer to the Sun, scientists have observed its unexpected release of water, challenging previous assumptions about comet activity at such distances.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Every interstellar comet so far has been a surprise,” said Zexi Xing, postdoctoral researcher and lead author of the study. “Each one is rewriting what we thought we knew about how planets and comets form around stars.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Insights like the presence of water in 3I/ATLAS are 'notes' from other planetary systems that need to be understood to garner a clearer picture of the universe,” stated Dennis Bodewits, professor of physics at Auburn.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of water in 3I/ATLAS adds to the growing body of knowledge about interstellar comets. Previous interstellar comets, such as 'Oumuamua and Borisov, had distinct characteristics that differed from typical solar system comets. These findings imply varied planet-forming environments across different star systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to continue monitoring 3I/ATLAS to gain further insights into its composition and activity as it approaches the Sun. This ongoing analysis may provide additional clues about the formation and evolution of comets in various planetary systems.</p>
