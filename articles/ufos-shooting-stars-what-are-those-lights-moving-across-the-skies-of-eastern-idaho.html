      <h2>UFOs? Shooting stars? What are those lights moving across the skies of Eastern Idaho?</h2>

<p>Residents in Eastern Idaho have observed a series of lights moving uniformly across the night sky over the past 30 days. Experts have identified these lights as Starlink satellites, according to Steven Shropshire, a physics professor at Idaho State University.</p>

<p>This phenomenon has raised questions among locals about the nature of these lights. Authorities and experts are addressing public curiosity by clarifying the origin of the lights and discussing the implications of satellite visibility on astronomy.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Observation period: past 30 days</li>
    <li>Identified by: Steven Shropshire, Idaho State University</li>
    <li>Type of satellites: Starlink satellites, launched by SpaceX</li>
    <li>Purpose: High-speed internet access, especially in remote areas</li>
    <li>Recent incidents: 40 of 49 SpaceX satellites fell out of orbit during a February launch</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>For the past month, residents of Eastern Idaho have reported seeing a line of lights in the night sky. Onlookers speculated about their nature, with some suggesting they were UFOs or meteors. Steven Shropshire identified the lights as Starlink satellites, which are designed to be reflective to catch attention.</p>
<p>Starlink satellites have been utilized in critical situations, such as during the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, where they have helped maintain communication. Despite their benefits, concerns have been raised regarding their impact on astronomical observations.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“They are actually designed to be reflective to get your attention. That is something they deliberately do with the Starlinks.”</blockquote>  
<p>- Steven Shropshire, Idaho State University</p>
<blockquote>“They can appear as streaks, which can make it difficult for astrophotography and various things.”</blockquote>  
<p>- Anna Hoskins, lecturer, Idaho State University</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Starlink satellites are part of a broader effort by SpaceX to provide global internet coverage. While they connect users in remote areas, concerns have emerged among astronomers about their brightness affecting celestial observations. SpaceX is reportedly working on innovations to reduce satellite brightness.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities and experts will continue to monitor the impact of Starlink satellites on astronomy as they pursue solutions to mitigate their visibility in the night sky.</p>
