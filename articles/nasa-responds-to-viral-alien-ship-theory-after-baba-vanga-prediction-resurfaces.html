      <h2>NASA Responds to Viral 'Alien Ship' Theory After Baba Vanga Prediction Resurfaces</h2>

<p>NASA has addressed speculation about the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which has gained attention following the resurfacing of a prophecy by the late Baba Vanga. The agency emphasized that the comet is simply a natural celestial body, not an alien spacecraft, during a briefing in Greenbelt, Maryland, on October 25, 2023.</p>

<p>This clarification comes as a response to growing online theories suggesting that 3I/ATLAS, believed to be 5 to 8 billion years old, could be an extraterrestrial vehicle. NASA has organized a comprehensive observation effort to study the comet, which has been monitored since its discovery on July 1, 2025. The agency aims to provide accurate information amid ongoing public interest and speculation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovery date: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Estimated age of 3I/ATLAS: 5 to 8 billion years</li>
    <li>NASA has deployed twelve resources, including telescopes and probes, for observation</li>
    <li>Location of briefing: Greenbelt, Maryland</li>
    <li>NASA's official statement released on October 25, 2023</li>
    <li>Speculation linked to predictions by Baba Vanga, a Bulgarian mystic</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, and has since prompted significant interest from the scientific community and the public. The comet's characteristics led to speculation about its origins, particularly following the revival of Baba Vanga's prophecies regarding extraterrestrial contact. In response, NASA organized an observation effort across the Solar System to study the comet.</p>

<p>On October 25, 2023, NASA held a news briefing in Greenbelt, Maryland, during which officials confirmed that 3I/ATLAS behaves like a conventional comet. They released new images and provided an update on the ongoing observations of the comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We love that the world wondered along with us. We were quick to be able to say, yup, it definitely behaves like a comet. We certainly haven't seen any technosignatures or anything from it that would lead us to believe it was anything other than a comet,”</blockquote>
<p>— Nicola Fox, associate administrator of NASA's Science Mission Directorate.</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The interest in 3I/ATLAS has been fueled by claims from Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb, who suggested that the comet might be alien technology. He noted anomalies in the object's orbit that he deemed statistically rare. However, he also acknowledged that the most straightforward explanation is that 3I/ATLAS is a natural comet.</p>

<p>Baba Vanga, known for her predictions about significant historical events, has been cited in discussions about 3I/ATLAS. Although some online chatter links her forecasts to this comet, no specific references to the object have been substantiated.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue its observational efforts to study 3I/ATLAS as it moves through the inner part of our Solar System. The agency aims to provide further updates as new data emerges, reinforcing the distinction between scientific inquiry and speculative theories.</p>
