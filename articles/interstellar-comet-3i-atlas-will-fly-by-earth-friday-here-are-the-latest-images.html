      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS will fly by Earth Friday</h2>

<p>An interstellar comet, known as 3I/ATLAS, will fly by Earth on Friday, coming within approximately 167 million miles (270 million kilometers) of the planet. The comet was first spotted in July as it passed through our solar system and is now making its departure, with its closest approach occurring on the far side of the sun.</p>

<p>This event is significant for scientists who have been tracking 3I/ATLAS since its discovery. They aim to learn more about its origin and composition, as it provides a unique opportunity to study an object from outside our solar system. The Virtual Telescope Project will livestream the comet at 4:00 a.m. UTC on Saturday, or 11 p.m. ET on Friday, after a previous attempt to stream was thwarted by cloudy weather.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS will come within 167 million miles (270 million kilometers) of Earth on Friday.</li>
    <li>The optimal viewing window for the comet has passed; it is not visible to the naked eye.</li>
    <li>Observers will need an 8-inch (20-centimeter) telescope or larger to view the comet.</li>
    <li>The Virtual Telescope Project will livestream the comet on December 16 at 4:00 a.m. UTC.</li>
    <li>NASA indicates the comet will remain observable for a few more months before leaving the solar system.</li>
    <li>Japan’s XRISM mission has detected X-rays from the comet, a first for interstellar comets.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first discovered in July 2023. Astronomers have since tracked its trajectory through our solar system. The comet will make its closest approach to Earth on December 15, 2023. The Virtual Telescope Project will provide a livestream of the comet on December 16, 2023, at 4:00 a.m. UTC, following a failed attempt on December 14 due to weather conditions.</p>

<p>In late November, Japan’s X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission observed the comet for 17 hours, capturing X-rays extending from the comet’s nucleus. The European Space Agency's XMM-Newton observatory also observed 3I/ATLAS on December 3, 2023, for about 20 hours.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Astronomers have closely tracked the comet since its initial discovery over the summer in the hopes of uncovering details about its origin outside of our solar system as well as its composition,” said a spokesperson from NASA.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is one of only a few interstellar comets to pass through our solar system. Previous comets, such as those observed in 2017 and 2019, did not show X-ray emissions, making the current observations noteworthy. The study of interstellar comets could provide insights into the materials and conditions present in other star systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to observe 3I/ATLAS as it moves away from the sun and Earth. Further analysis of the X-ray emissions and other data collected from various missions will help determine the comet's composition and characteristics.</p>
