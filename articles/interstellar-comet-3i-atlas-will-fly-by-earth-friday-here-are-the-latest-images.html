      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS will fly by Earth Friday</h2>

<p>An interstellar comet known as 3I/ATLAS will make its closest approach to Earth on Friday, coming within approximately 167 million miles (270 million kilometers) of the planet. The comet was first observed in July as it entered our solar system and is now departing, but it will not be visible to the naked eye during this flyby.</p>

<p>This event is significant for scientists who have been tracking 3I/ATLAS to learn more about its origin and composition. Various space missions have been monitoring the comet in different wavelengths of light, including recent findings in X-rays, which could provide insights into its characteristics and behavior compared to comets from our solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Closest approach: Friday, coming within 167 million miles (270 million kilometers) of Earth.</li>
    <li>Optimal viewing window has closed; requires an 8-inch (20-centimeter) telescope or larger for observation.</li>
    <li>Virtual Telescope Project will livestream the comet at 4:00 a.m. UTC on Friday (11 p.m. ET Thursday).</li>
    <li>X-ray observations made by Japan’s XRISM for 17 hours in late November.</li>
    <li>European Space Agency’s XMM-Newton observed the comet for about 20 hours on December 3.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first discovered in July as it began its journey through our solar system. Since then, astronomers have closely monitored the comet to gather information about its composition and origin.</p>

<p>In November, the optimal viewing window opened, but it has since closed. The comet will continue to be observed by telescopes and space missions for a few more months before it exits our solar system.</p>

<p>Recent X-ray observations were conducted by Japan’s XRISM and the European Space Agency, providing new data on the comet's properties.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“X-rays can originate from interactions between gases given off by the comet and the continuous stream of charged particles releasing from the sun called solar wind,” said representatives from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The dramatic image released by the European Space Agency shows the red X-ray glow of the comet,” according to a statement from the agency.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar comet observed in our solar system, following two others in 2017 and 2019. Previous attempts to detect X-rays from these comets were unsuccessful, making the current findings significant for understanding how interstellar comets behave.</p>

<p>Comets are composed of ice, rock, dust, and gas, and they heat up as they approach the sun, which causes them to sublimate materials and release gases.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to observe 3I/ATLAS and analyze the data collected from various missions to better understand its composition and behavior before it departs our solar system.</p>
