      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Lights Up December Skies</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has brightened significantly as it approaches Earth, with its closest approach scheduled for December 19, 2025. Discovered on July 1, 2025, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System telescope in Río Hurtado, Chile, it is only the third confirmed interstellar visitor to our Solar System.</p>

<p>This event is significant as astronomers release new findings, including images from the Hubble Space Telescope and ESA's Juice spacecraft, as well as the detection of the comet's first radio signal. Research indicates the presence of methanol and hydrogen cyanide, molecules associated with both the origins and destruction of life. NASA and comet experts have urged caution against speculative claims that the comet may be of alien origin, emphasizing that current evidence supports its natural composition.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS passed perihelion on October 29-30, 2025, at approximately 1.36-1.4 astronomical units from the Sun.</li>
    <li>The comet will make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, at about 1.8 AU, or 270 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>It is moving at speeds of 58 km/s (about 130,000 mph) relative to the Sun.</li>
    <li>NASA has confirmed that 3I/ATLAS poses no impact threat to Earth.</li>
    <li>Current brightness is around magnitude 11-12, making it too faint for unaided vision.</li>
    <li>Observations have detected high amounts of methanol and hydrogen cyanide being emitted from the comet.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is estimated to be between 3 and 14 billion years old.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System telescope in Río Hurtado, Chile. It passed perihelion on October 29-30, 2025, and re-emerged for observation in early December 2025. The comet is currently on a trajectory that will bring it closest to Earth on December 19, 2025.</p>

<p>NASA's Hubble Space Telescope observed the comet on November 30, 2025, when it was approximately 286 million kilometers from Earth. This observation revealed a compact nucleus surrounded by a bright coma and an anti-tail pointing toward the Sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“All the evidence so far points to a perfectly natural (if extremely weird) comet,” NASA officials said, in response to claims of alien origin.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Martin Cordiner, from NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, stated that 3I/ATLAS is emitting hundreds of grams per second of hydrogen cyanide and producing around 40 kilograms of methanol per second.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS follows in the footsteps of two previous interstellar objects, 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Its discovery and current observations add to the understanding of interstellar bodies and their compositions, which differ significantly from typical Solar System comets.</p>

<p>The presence of methanol and hydrogen cyanide in 3I/ATLAS is particularly notable, as these compounds may play a role in the formation of the building blocks of life.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches its closest point to Earth, astronomers will continue to monitor its activity and composition. Further observations are planned, and findings will contribute to ongoing research into the origins of interstellar objects.</p>
