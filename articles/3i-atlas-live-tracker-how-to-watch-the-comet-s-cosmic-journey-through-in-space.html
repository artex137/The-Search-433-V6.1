      <h2>3I/ATLAS live tracker: How to watch the comet’s cosmic journey through space</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, also known as C/2025 N1, is currently passing through the constellation Octans in the southern sky and is expected to make its closest approach to the Sun in October 2025. Discovered in 2024 by the ATLAS survey in Hawaii, this interstellar object is heating up, causing its icy nucleus to release gas and dust, forming a glowing coma and a visible tail.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it marks the third known interstellar object to enter our Solar System. Authorities and astronomers are actively monitoring its trajectory and brightness, providing various online tools for the public to track its journey.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1)</li>
    <li><strong>Discovered:</strong> 2024 by the ATLAS survey in Hawaii</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to the Sun:</strong> October 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Current Location:</strong> Constellation Octans, southern sky</li>
    <li><strong>Best Viewing Times:</strong> Early morning hours, just before dawn</li>
    <li><strong>Expected Visibility:</strong> Potentially visible to the naked eye under dark skies</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been on a hyperbolic orbit since its discovery, confirming its extra-solar origin. As it approaches the Sun, the comet is expected to heat up, enhancing its brightness and forming a visible tail.</p>

<p>Key dates for observers include:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>October 2025:</strong> Closest approach to the Sun.</li>
    <li><strong>Late 2025:</strong> Best viewing opportunities as the comet becomes brighter.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Observers can expect to see a faint, greenish glow with a tail stretching across the sky,” said a representative from NASA's Planetary Defense Coordination Office.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object identified in our Solar System, following previous discoveries that have sparked interest in celestial phenomena. The comet's trajectory and brightness are being closely monitored by various astronomical organizations.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey, astronomers will provide updates on its brightness and position. Observers are encouraged to utilize apps such as TheSkyLive, Star Walk 2, and Sky Tonight to enhance their viewing experience.</p>
