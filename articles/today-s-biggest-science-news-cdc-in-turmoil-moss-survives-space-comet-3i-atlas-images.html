      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Images Released by NASA</h2>

<p>NASA has released new images of Comet 3I/ATLAS as it continues its journey toward Earth, according to the agency's announcement on November 19, 2025. The comet's trajectory has drawn significant interest from the scientific community and the general public.</p>

<p>The release of these images is important for both astronomers and enthusiasts. Observing the comet helps scientists understand its composition and behavior, which can provide insights into the early solar system. NASA has encouraged the public to follow the comet's path as it approaches Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is currently on a trajectory toward Earth.</li>
    <li>NASA released images of the comet on November 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet's journey has generated significant public interest.</li>
    <li>Observations may provide insights into the early solar system.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>NASA has been tracking Comet 3I/ATLAS since its discovery. The agency's latest images, released on November 19, 2025, showcase the comet as it approaches Earth. The comet's path has been closely monitored by astronomers around the world.</p>

<p>As the comet continues its journey, NASA plans to release additional observations and updates to keep the public informed about its status. The next key dates for public observation will be announced as the comet gets closer to Earth.</p>
