      <h2>Astronomers shocked at rapid brightening of comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Astronomers have observed a dramatic increase in the brightness of comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches its perihelion on 29 October 2025. Researchers Qicheng Zhang from Lowell Observatory and Karl Battams from the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory reported the phenomenon in a preprint article submitted to the Astrophysical Journal Letters on 28 October 2025, according to Spaceweather.com.</p>

<p>This rapid brightening of the rare comet is significant as it exceeds the brightness increase rate of most comets in the Oort cloud. Authorities are closely monitoring the comet, utilizing both ground-based and space-based telescopes to gather data as it nears the Sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS approached its perihelion on 29 October 2025.</li>
    <li>The brightness increase has been observed to be twice the rate seen earlier in the year.</li>
    <li>Ground-based telescopes lost sight of the comet during its closest approach.</li>
    <li>Coronagraphs aboard STEREO-A, SOHO, and NOAA's GOES-19 satellite continued to monitor the comet.</li>
    <li>NOAA’s CCOR-1 coronagraph showed a coma 4 arcminutes wide.</li>
    <li>The European Space Agency's JUICE spacecraft will begin observations on 2 November 2025.</li>
    <li>Ground-based telescopes will regain visibility of the comet in late November and December.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 29 October 2025, comet 3I/ATLAS reached its perihelion. Observations leading up to this date indicated a rapid increase in brightness, noted by researchers Qicheng Zhang and Karl Battams. Their analysis of coronagraph data from September and October revealed an exponential brightness increase as the comet approached the Sun.</p>

<p>Following its perihelion, the European Space Agency's JUICE spacecraft is scheduled to observe the comet starting on 2 November 2025, taking advantage of its increased brightness.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The reason for the rapid increase in brightness of 3I/ATLAS, which far exceeds the rate of increase in brightness of most comets in the Oort cloud, remains unclear,” said Qicheng Zhang and Karl Battams in their report.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Our preliminary analysis of these data indicates that the comet is likely to emerge from solar conjunction considerably brighter than when it entered,” they added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This unusual phenomenon has captured the attention of astronomers as it deviates from typical comet behaviour. Previous observations of comets show varying brightness increases, but the rapid rate of 3I/ATLAS is notable and warrants further study.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor comet 3I/ATLAS, with the JUICE spacecraft set to provide closer observations starting 2 November 2025. Ground-based telescopes are expected to regain visibility of the comet in late November and December, allowing for additional analysis and data collection.</p>
