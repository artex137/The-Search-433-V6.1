      <h2>Cosmic Soda in Space: Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Burps Carbon Dioxide in Jaw-Dropping Discovery</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has surprised scientists by releasing large amounts of carbon dioxide, creating a glowing cloud around its icy core. Observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and NASA's SPHEREx mission have revealed this phenomenon, which has occurred during the comet's approach to perihelion near 30 October.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant because it challenges existing assumptions about interstellar comets and their evolution during long travels through space. Researchers are investigating the implications of the comet's unique composition, which may provide insights into the chemistry of other star systems.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is releasing carbon dioxide, creating a coma nearly 348,000 kilometres wide.</li>
<li>The CO<sub>2</sub>-to-water ratio observed is approximately 8:1, one of the highest recorded.</li>
<li>The comet will pass no closer than 1.8 astronomical units from Earth, about 170 million miles.</li>
<li>Observations took place using JWST on 6 August and will continue with SPHEREx and Hubble Space Telescope.</li>
<li>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object to enter the solar system.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 6 August, the JWST targeted comet 3I/ATLAS, revealing a high concentration of carbon dioxide in its coma. This data indicated a CO<sub>2</sub> ratio significantly different from typical solar-system comets. Following this, NASA's SPHEREx mission confirmed the presence of a massive CO<sub>2</sub> cloud surrounding the comet.</p>

<p>As the comet approaches perihelion on 30 October, it has brightened sharply, which has been attributed to the sublimation of CO<sub>2</sub> from its outer layers. Instruments aboard SOHO, STEREO, and GOES-19 have recorded this increase in brightness.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The unusually high carbon dioxide concentration suggests the object may have been exposed to far stronger radiation environments than typical solar-system comets,” said a spokesperson from NASA Science.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The dominance of CO<sub>2</sub> changes our expectations of how interstellar comets behave,” noted a researcher involved in the study.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object to enter our solar system, following previous discoveries that have provided limited insights into interstellar material. The unique characteristics of 3I/ATLAS may offer a better understanding of how objects from other star systems evolve and interact with cosmic radiation over time.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Ongoing monitoring of comet 3I/ATLAS by JWST, SPHEREx, and the Hubble Space Telescope will continue to assess its chemical composition and the potential for unaltered material within its deeper layers. This research aims to enhance our understanding of the formation and evolution of icy bodies in the galaxy.</p>
