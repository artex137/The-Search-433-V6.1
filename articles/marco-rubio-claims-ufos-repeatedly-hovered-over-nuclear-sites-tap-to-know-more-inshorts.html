      <h2>Marco Rubio claims UFOs hovered over nuclear sites</h2>

<p>In the documentary <em>The Age of Disclosure</em>, Secretary of State Marco Rubio has alleged that unidentified flying objects (UFOs) have repeatedly entered restricted airspace over nuclear sites. The documentary suggests that some governments may be withholding information from the White House regarding these incidents. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This claim has significant implications for national security and has revived discussions about the potential threats posed by unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP). Authorities, including the Pentagon, are examining this issue more closely, particularly in light of recent data on UAP sightings.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>

    <li>Claims of non-human intelligence have been made by military insiders.</li>
    <li>No physical evidence has been disclosed to support these claims.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>

Over a period of four years, the number of reported sightings has reached approximately 1,600. Rubio's statements in the documentary highlight concerns about national security and the potential implications of these unidentified objects.</p>

<p>Military insiders have suggested that some of these phenomena may involve non-human intelligence, although concrete evidence remains absent. The discussions surrounding these sightings have prompted calls for more transparency and investigation into the matter.</p>
