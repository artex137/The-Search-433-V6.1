      <h2>Space Revelation - NASA Scientists Discover the Mysterious Object 3I/ATLAS Is Far Larger Than Previously Estimated</h2>

<p>NASA scientists have confirmed that the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, detected earlier this year, is significantly larger than previously estimated. This discovery marks it as the third interstellar object ever identified, following ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. The object, which has been traveling through our solar system, poses no threat to Earth at this time.</p>

<p>The findings are crucial as they expand our understanding of celestial objects from beyond our solar system. Researchers are closely monitoring 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Mars’ orbit, providing a unique opportunity for study. NASA’s HiRISE camera aboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter will track the object in high resolution, offering insights into its composition and behavior.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is over 5 kilometers wide and weighs more than 33 billion tons.</li>
    <li>It is currently passing near Jupiter, Venus, and Mars.</li>
    <li>The object will come within 2.68 million kilometers of Mars’ orbit.</li>
    <li>NASA's HiRISE camera will monitor 3I/ATLAS for further study.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist, has led the analysis of the object.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected crossing into our solar system earlier this year. Initially thought to be a comet, further observations revealed its unusual behavior and mass loss patterns. Researchers have concluded that it is significantly larger than both ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov.</p>

<p>As it approaches Mars' orbit, scientists continue to analyze its trajectory and characteristics. The object’s green glow, attributed to the release of carbon-based gases, has also been noted, though it is not considered hazardous.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, “3I/ATLAS is a beast. It raises questions about whether it formed naturally or if it might be something else entirely.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This discovery follows the detection of two previous interstellar objects, which have provided valuable data on the nature of celestial bodies from other star systems. The study of 3I/ATLAS could further enhance our understanding of the formation and behavior of such objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and other astronomers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Mars. Further observations will help clarify its composition and origin, contributing to the ongoing exploration of interstellar phenomena.</p>
