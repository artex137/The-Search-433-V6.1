      <h2>Thousands of UFOs Reportedly Detected Beneath US Waters</h2>

<p>Thousands of underwater UFO sightings have been logged along US coastlines, according to a report by IBTimes UK. The UFO-tracking platform Enigma has recorded over 9,000 unexplained underwater sightings within 16 kilometres of America's shores since 2022. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to these sightings.</p>

<p>The report has sparked global speculation about possible alien submersible activity. Defence analysts warn that these unexplained movements could indicate advanced, undisclosed technology. The New York Post has noted that these objects were primarily detected off the coasts of California and Florida.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Over 9,000 unexplained underwater sightings logged since 2022.</li>
<li>Majority of sightings detected near California and Florida coasts.</li>
<li>USOs defined as underwater objects that do not match known craft.</li>
<li>Incidents involve rapid ascents and abrupt directional changes.</li>
<li>US Department of Defence has not verified any evidence of extraterrestrial technology.</li>
<li>All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) urges critical examination of reports.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Since 2022, Enigma has compiled sightings of unidentified submersible objects (USOs) primarily off the US coasts. The sightings have raised security concerns, particularly near sensitive naval zones. Retired Rear Admiral Tim Gallaudet has spoken out about the implications of these sightings, highlighting their potential to represent technology beyond current capabilities.</p>

<p>In recent statements, Congressman Tim Burchett has discussed incidents where naval personnel have reportedly chased underwater objects moving at extraordinary speeds, further heightening interest and concern regarding the nature of these sightings.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Some appear to hover just above the ocean surface or plunge into the sea without a splash, a phenomenon that has baffled both enthusiasts and military observers,” said Gallaudet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“These sightings could be world-changing if proven real,” Gallaudet added.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“This underscores how little we know about our own oceans,” Gallaudet said, calling for global cooperation in undersea monitoring.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The phenomenon of USOs is closely related to previously documented unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs). The growing number of underwater sightings has prompted calls for improved maritime domain awareness. Analysts emphasize the need for better tracking of unknown craft that may travel between air, sea, and space.</p>

<p>Despite the increasing reports, the US Department of Defence remains cautious. The AARO has stated that many incidents could be attributed to sensor anomalies, classified aircraft, or natural phenomena that are not yet understood.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the sightings continue, with researchers advocating for enhanced sensor integration across radar, sonar, and satellite systems. The USO phenomenon remains unverified, but experts stress the importance of scientific inquiry into these unexplained underwater activities.</p>
