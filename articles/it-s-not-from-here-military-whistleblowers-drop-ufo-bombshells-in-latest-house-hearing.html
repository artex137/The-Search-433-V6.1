      <h2>‘It’s Not From Here’: Military Whistleblowers Drop UFO Bombshells in Latest House Hearing</h2>

<p>Three military veterans have testified at a House hearing on Tuesday, revealing their experiences with unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs) and alleging a campaign to silence witnesses. The hearing, held by the House Oversight and Government Reform’s Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets, featured previously unseen footage of a UFO being struck by a Hellfire missile.</p>

<p>The testimony has raised concerns about the treatment of military personnel who report UAP encounters. Lawmakers have expressed frustration over the apparent lack of transparency regarding these incidents. The hearing aimed to shed light on the nature of UAPs and the implications for national security.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Date: October 30, 2024</li>
<li>Location: House Oversight and Government Reform hearing</li>
<li>Witnesses: Jeffrey Nuccetelli, Dylan Borland, Alexandro Wiggins, George Knapp</li>
<li>Event: Release of UFO footage and testimonies regarding UAP encounters</li>
<li>Claims of retaliation against military personnel reporting UFOs</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 30, 2024, Congressman Eric Burlison presented footage showing a U.S. military drone firing a Hellfire missile at a UFO off the coast of Yemen. The missile did not impact the craft, which continued on its path unaffected.</p>

<p>During the hearing, Jeffrey Nuccetelli described multiple unexplained incidents he documented at Vandenberg Air Force Base from 2003 to 2005. He highlighted a pattern of retaliation against personnel who reported encounters. Dylan Borland recounted his experience of having his career impacted after reporting a UFO sighting in 2012.</p>

<p>George Knapp discussed a significant event from October 1982 involving UFOs over a Soviet missile base, which nearly led to a nuclear launch. He noted that the situation was only resolved when the unidentified objects disappeared.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“Exceptional evidence,” declared former Air Force military police officer Jeffrey Nuccetelli.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“We’ve never seen anything like that. It defies what we know to be technologically possible. What are we supposed to think?” said Congressman Jared Moskowitz.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“That is unacceptable. We cannot protect our airspace if our best-trained observers are silenced,” stated Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This hearing is part of a broader effort to address the stigma surrounding UAP reporting within the military. Previous incidents have raised questions about national security and the potential implications of UAPs on military operations.</p>

<p>The testimonies from these military professionals present a stark contrast to the often-dismissed narratives surrounding UFOs. Their experiences suggest a systemic issue regarding the treatment of personnel who report such phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The House Oversight and Government Reform Task Force plans to continue investigating the claims made during the hearing. Further discussions on the treatment of military personnel reporting UAP encounters are expected in upcoming sessions.</p>
