      <h2>3I/ATLAS precovery images captured by NASA's TESS show no coma - What it means</h2>

<p>Scientists from the American Astronomical Society have reported that precovery images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, captured by NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), show no signs of a coma. The findings were published following an analysis of TESS data, which took place between May 7 and June 1, 2025. The comet was first detected on July 1, 2023.</p>

<p>This analysis is significant as it helps clarify the comet's activity and behavior. Researchers have expressed interest in 3I/ATLAS due to its unusual characteristics, including its speed and brightness. The lack of a coma in the TESS images suggests that the comet may not have been actively emitting gas or dust during the observation period, although this does not rule out the possibility of low-level activity.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
  <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> July 1, 2023</li>
  <li><strong>TESS Observation Period:</strong> May 7 - June 1, 2025</li>
  <li><strong>Analysis by:</strong> American Astronomical Society</li>
  <li><strong>Findings:</strong> No extended coma detected</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first discovered on July 1, 2023. In the following months, scientists observed its unusual behavior, prompting further analysis. Between May 7 and June 1, 2025, TESS captured a series of images of the comet. The American Astronomical Society conducted a detailed analysis of these images to identify any signs of a coma.</p>

<p>After reviewing the TESS data, researchers noted that no extended coma was found, indicating that the comet may have been inactive during that time. They did, however, observe a "faint extended coma" in follow-up observations post-discovery.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This suggests that 3I experienced a notable increase in its activity when it was at a heliocentric distance ∼6 au,” the researchers stated in their latest paper.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The observations from early May are consistent with either a bare nucleus, with very low levels of activity, or with very slow dust emission velocities,” they added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has drawn attention due to its interstellar origin and the peculiarities associated with its movement and brightness. Previous observations have shown variations in the comet's activity, but the latest findings from TESS indicate a lack of significant activity during the observation period.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS and analyze further data to better understand its behavior and any potential activity that may emerge as it approaches the Sun.</p>
