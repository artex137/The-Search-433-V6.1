      <h2>NASA Insists Interstellar Visitor Is ‘Just a Comet’ as Public Speculation Lingers</h2>

<p>NASA officials have stated that the interstellar object known as Comet 3I Atlas, currently passing through the solar system, is a comet, despite ongoing public speculation that it could be an alien craft. The comments came during a press conference held at the Goddard Space Flight Center on Wednesday, where officials sought to clarify the object's status amid theories fueled by recent online discussions.</p>

<p>This announcement is significant as it addresses concerns raised during the recent U.S. government shutdown, which left a gap in communication and allowed speculation to flourish. NASA officials emphasized that the object's behavior aligns with that of a standard comet and that available data does not support claims of it being anything else.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I Atlas was first detected on July 1, 2023, by NASA’s ATLAS survey telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>The Hubble Space Telescope captured images of the comet from approximately 277 million miles away later in July.</li>
    <li>The comet made its closest approach to the sun on October 30, 2023.</li>
    <li>NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter photographed the comet from 19 million miles away on October 2, 2023.</li>
    <li>NASA officials have stated that 3I Atlas is made of rock, ice, and dust.</li>
    <li>The comet has shown different characteristics from other known comets, according to NASA scientists.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2023, Comet 3I Atlas was first detected by NASA’s ATLAS survey telescope in Chile, marking it as the third confirmed interstellar object observed. Later in July, the Hubble Space Telescope provided images of the comet, revealing a teardrop-shaped coma. On October 2, NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter captured close images, while the comet's closest approach to the sun occurred on October 30, 2023.</p>

<p>Throughout this period, speculation about the comet’s nature intensified, particularly after comments from Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist, who questioned whether 3I Atlas behaved like a typical comet. This speculation was further amplified by social media discussions and statements from U.S. lawmakers.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “I think it’s important that we talk about how this object is a comet. It looks and behaves like a comet, and all evidence points to it being a comet,” said Amit Kshatriya, NASA’s Associate Administrator.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “3I Atlas is not just a window into another solar system, it's a window into the deep past, and so deep in the past that it predates even the formation of our Earth and our Sun,” said Shawn Domagal-Goldman, Director for NASA’s astrophysics division.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The recent surge in public interest and speculation surrounding Comet 3I Atlas reflects a broader trend of heightened scrutiny of scientific institutions, particularly in the context of unexplained phenomena. Previous instances of unusual celestial events have often led to similar speculative theories, particularly when communication from official sources is limited.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA officials continue to monitor Comet 3I Atlas as it travels through the solar system, with plans for ongoing observations to further study its characteristics and composition. The agency is expected to provide updates as more data becomes available.</p>
