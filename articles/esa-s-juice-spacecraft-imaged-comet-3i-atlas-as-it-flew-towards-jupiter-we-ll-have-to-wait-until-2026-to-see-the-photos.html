      <h2>ESA's JUICE Spacecraft Imaged Comet 3I/ATLAS As It Flew Towards Jupiter</h2>

<p>The European Space Agency's (ESA) Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) has imaged comet 3I/ATLAS as it traveled toward Jupiter between November 2 and November 25, 2023. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>The imaging of comet 3I/ATLAS is significant as it provides valuable data on the comet's composition and behavior. The observations were made during JUICE's cruise phase, which was not initially scheduled for scientific activities. ESA officials have stated that the resulting images will be transmitted to Earth, but they will not be available until February 2026.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet 3I/ATLAS</strong> was first spotted on July 1, 2023, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS).</li>
    <li>JUICE observed the comet from a distance of 0.5 astronomical units.</li>
    <li>ESA utilized five instruments during the observation, including a camera and a UV spectrometer.</li>
    <li>The spacecraft is currently using its main antenna as a heat shield due to solar proximity.</li>
    <li>Data from the observations is expected to arrive in February 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2023, comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered by ATLAS. Between November 2 and November 25, 2023, the JUICE spacecraft captured images of the comet while en route to Jupiter. The images were taken using various scientific instruments onboard JUICE.</p>

<p>On October 4, 2025, NASA's Perseverance rover also observed 3I/ATLAS from the surface of Mars, approximately 19 million miles away. This marked one of the closest observations made from Mars.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“All this campaign was unexpected for everybody! For JUICE, indeed, we are in a cruise phase during which there are thermal constraints,” said Olivier Witasse, ESA Project Scientist.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“As JUICE is currently close to the Sun, it is using its main high-gain antenna as a heat shield,” ESA explained. “It is also far from Earth, on the other side of the Sun. Therefore, we don’t expect to receive data from JUICE’s observations of 3I/ATLAS until February 2026.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is not the first time JUICE has adapted its operations due to thermal conditions. During its previous mission phases, it also used its high-gain antenna as a thermal shield while performing gravity assists. The mission is designed for the cold environment of Jupiter, highlighting the challenges faced when operating near the Sun.</p>

<p>ESA has plans for future comet missions, including the Comet Interceptor, which aims to visit comets from the outer solar system and potentially interstellar comets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following the successful imaging of comet 3I/ATLAS, ESA will await the transmission of data and images to Earth, expected in February 2026. Future missions aim to enhance our understanding of comets and their role in the solar system.</p>
