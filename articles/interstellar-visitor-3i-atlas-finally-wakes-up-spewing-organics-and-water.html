      <h2>Interstellar Visitor 3I/ATLAS Finally Wakes Up, Spewing Organics and Water</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has reemerged from behind the Sun, showing significant activity since its closest approach in December 2023. The interstellar visitor, which has been monitored for eight months, is now releasing large quantities of water and organic molecules as it travels through the solar system.</p>

<p>This development is significant for scientists studying the comet, as it offers insights into the composition of interstellar objects. NASA's SPHEREx observatory, which launched in March 2022, has been tracking 3I/ATLAS and has documented the changes in its activity, providing valuable data for researchers.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS reemerged in December 2023 after its closest approach to the Sun.</li>
    <li>Water production levels increased to nearly <strong>40 times</strong> the previous measurements from August 2023.</li>
    <li>Carbon dioxide production surged to <strong>80 times</strong> the earlier readings.</li>
    <li>SPHEREx conducted preliminary observations in August 2023 and subsequent observations in December 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet shows a pear-shaped outgassing pattern, with the stem pointing towards the Sun.</li>
    <li>Next observational window for SPHEREx is planned for April 2024.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first discovered in 2022 and has been observed closely since then. In August 2023, SPHEREx conducted its initial observations, noting minimal activity from the comet. Following its perihelion in December 2023, SPHEREx observed significant changes in the comet's outgassing, indicating a dramatic increase in water and organic material.</p>

<p>As the Sun's energy impacted the comet, it began releasing volatiles, including a new detection of cyanide. The changes in the comet's activity have prompted further analysis and research.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This is a unique observational opportunity to witness the changes in an interstellar comet,” said Carey Lisse of Johns Hopkins University, a co-author of the paper detailing the findings.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The activity of 3I/ATLAS is significant as it represents a rare chance to study an interstellar object passing through our solar system. Previous observations of comets have shown varying levels of activity, but the current findings suggest a dramatic transformation in this particular comet due to its interaction with the Sun.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to continue monitoring 3I/ATLAS as it moves away from the Sun, with SPHEREx set to conduct its next observation in April 2024. Further studies are expected to follow as scientists analyze the data collected during this unique event.</p>
