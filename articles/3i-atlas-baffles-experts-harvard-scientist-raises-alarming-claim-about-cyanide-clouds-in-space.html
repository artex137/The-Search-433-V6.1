      <h2>3I/ATLAS Baffles Experts: Harvard Scientist Raises Alarming Claim About Cyanide Clouds in Space</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has raised concerns among scientists after a Harvard astrophysicist suggested it may have shed toxic material as it flew past Earth on 19 December 2023. Avi Loeb has characterized the comet as a potential "intergalactic cyanide tablet" due to the detection of a plume containing cyanide and hydrogen cyanide surrounding it.</p>

<p>This claim has prompted scrutiny from the scientific community, with experts examining the implications of the comet's composition. Authorities and researchers are currently analyzing data from telescopes that monitored 3I/ATLAS’s approach to the Sun, seeking to understand the potential risks associated with its chemical emissions.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date of flyby:</strong> 19 December 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Distance at closest approach:</strong> Approximately 270 million kilometres (168–170 million miles)</li>
    <li><strong>Detected substances:</strong> Cyanide and hydrogen cyanide</li>
    <li><strong>Primary researcher:</strong> Avi Loeb, Harvard astrophysicist</li>
    <li><strong>Observatory involved:</strong> Atacama Large Millimetre/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Chile</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 19 December 2023, 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to Earth, prompting observations from various telescopes. During the autumn, ALMA detected methanol and hydrogen cyanide associated with the comet.</p>
<p>Following the flyby, Loeb raised concerns about the potential for hazardous materials reaching Earth, framing the comet as a significant topic for scientific discussion.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "Hydrogen cyanide at large concentrations is a poison," emphasizing its historical use as a chemical weapon during the First World War.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loeb also noted, "Given the mass loss rate measured by the Webb Space Telescope, the gas around 3I/ATLAS would be swept up by the solar wind at a distance of just a few million kilometres from 3I/ATLAS."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The detection of hydrogen cyanide around comets is not unprecedented, but the implications of 3I/ATLAS's composition have sparked heightened interest. Previous research has indicated that comets can release various gases as they approach the Sun, though the likelihood of harmful material reaching Earth is generally considered low.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze data from telescopes monitoring 3I/ATLAS and evaluate the potential risks associated with its chemical emissions. Ongoing studies will also explore the comet's trajectory and any future interactions with other celestial bodies.</p>
