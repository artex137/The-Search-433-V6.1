      <h2>Bill Maher Guest Claims US Recovered Alien Craft With Bodies Inside In On-Air Bombshell</h2>

<p>Filmmaker Dan Farah has claimed on Bill Maher’s Club Random that the United States, along with Russia and China, has recovered crashed alien craft containing non-human bodies. The revelation came during a discussion about his new documentary, Age of Disclosure, aired this week.</p>

<p>This claim raises significant questions about national security and the implications of extraterrestrial technology. Farah stated that individuals with direct government experience have provided testimony for his film, which highlights secret crash retrieval programs not disclosed to the public.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Filmmaker Dan Farah made the claims during an episode of Club Random.</li>
    <li>The documentary is titled Age of Disclosure.</li>
    <li>Farah interviewed military personnel, senators, and senior intelligence officials.</li>
    <li>The technology in recovered crafts is described as advanced but not infallible.</li>
    <li>Farah compared the race for understanding alien technology to a 'Manhattan Project on steroids.'</li>
    <li>He warned of potential global consequences if adversaries access this technology first.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>During the episode, Farah explained that since the late 1940s, the US intelligence community has maintained a culture of secrecy regarding UFOs. This effort included compartmentalizing credible sightings and evidence among agencies like the CIA and Department of Defence. In recent years, however, some officials have begun to speak out on the matter.</p>

<p>Farah emphasized that while there has been a long-standing stigma surrounding UFOs, the truth is gradually emerging, although it remains fragmented. He expressed hope that this conversation would lead to greater transparency and understanding.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The technology is not flawless... These recoveries allowed intelligence agencies to study and possibly reverse engineer capabilities far beyond our current understanding.” - Dan Farah</blockquote>
<blockquote>“We are barreling towards a crossroads... These intelligent non-human visitors are monitoring us, but what if another nation beats us to this knowledge?” - Dan Farah</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The stigma was genius in a way... It discouraged people from asking questions and created decades of silence.” - Dan Farah</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discussion touches on a broader narrative that has evolved since the Cold War, where secrecy around UFOs was used to prevent public panic and keep adversaries uninformed. Farah's claims highlight the ongoing efforts to understand and potentially harness alien technology, which he argues could lead to significant advancements in energy and propulsion.</p>

<p>Farah also hinted at the possibility of a future US president, such as Donald Trump, publicly confirming the existence of non-human life, which he believes would be a pivotal moment in human history.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Farah’s documentary aims to shed light on the implications of recovered alien technology and the need for global collaboration. He stressed the urgency of addressing the potential consequences of such advancements before they fall into the wrong hands.</p>
