      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS: NASA and Hubble Reveal a Rare Visitor’s Solar System Journey</h2>

<p>NASA and astronomers have confirmed the arrival of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, discovered by the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile in July 2025. This marks the third interstellar comet ever observed, entering our solar system from the direction of Sagittarius. Upon discovery, 3I/ATLAS was located 4.51 astronomical units (AU) from the Sun and moving at a speed of 58 km (36 miles) per second.</p>

<p>The comet’s unique hyperbolic trajectory indicates it originated outside the solar system. Its path has included a close approach to Mars on October 3, 2025, and it reached perihelion, its closest point to the Sun, on October 30, 2025. The scientific community is closely monitoring 3I/ATLAS, as it offers a valuable opportunity to study materials from beyond our solar neighborhood.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovery date:</strong> July 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Discovered by:</strong> ATLAS survey telescope, Chile</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> 58 km (36 miles) per second</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to Mars:</strong> October 3, 2025 (0.194 AU)</li>
    <li><strong>Perihelion:</strong> October 30, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Expected near Jupiter:</strong> March 2026</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, astronomers confirmed the discovery of 3I/ATLAS, marking it as the third observed interstellar comet. Following its discovery, the comet made a close approach to Mars on October 3, 2025, before reaching perihelion on October 30, 2025. Throughout this period, NASA’s PUNCH mission captured time-lapse images of both 3I/ATLAS and Comet SWAN, highlighting their unique characteristics.</p>

<p>On November 30, 2025, the Hubble Space Telescope provided striking images of 3I/ATLAS, revealing its teardrop-shaped coma and anti-tail extending up to 60,000 km (37,282 miles).</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Hubble tracked the comet as it moved across the sky. As a result, background stars appear as streaks of light,” NASA stated.</blockquote>

<blockquote>According to Harvard University’s Professor Avi Loeb, “the teardrop extension may represent a swarm of macroscopic non-volatile objects that separated from the comet due to non-gravitational acceleration away from the Sun.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interstellar comets like 3I/ATLAS are significant because they carry materials from distant star systems. Each observation offers insights into the chemical and physical properties of matter that has never been part of our solar system. The study of such comets helps scientists understand the mechanisms that eject comets from their home systems and the impact of solar radiation on these icy bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey through the solar system, astronomers will maintain observations for several months. This ongoing study aims to uncover more about the composition of interstellar material and the physics governing these rare cosmic visitors.</p>
