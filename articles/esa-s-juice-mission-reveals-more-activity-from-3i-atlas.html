      <h2>ESA's JUICE Mission Reveals More Activity from 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>In November 2025, the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has emerged from behind the Sun and is now making its way towards the outer Solar System. This follows an increase in activity after its closest approach to the Sun, making the comet visible to telescopes and robotic space missions. The European Space Agency's (ESA) JUpiter Icy Moon Explorer (JUICE) has captured images of 3I/ATLAS, with a notable observation made on November 2, 2025, when the spacecraft was approximately 66 million km from the comet.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as it allows scientists to study the comet's behavior and composition. The data collected by JUICE will enhance our understanding of the origins of comets and the conditions in the early Solar System. Full data from the probe's observations is expected to reach Earth in February 2026.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS emerged from behind the Sun in November 2025.</li>
    <li>JUICE captured images on November 2, 2025, from 66 million km away.</li>
    <li>Images revealed a bright coma and two distinct tails: a plasma tail and a dust tail.</li>
    <li>Full data from JUICE is anticipated between February 18 and 20, 2026.</li>
    <li>Data will include images from five science instruments aboard JUICE.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In October 2025, ESA's Mars Express and ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) photographed 3I/ATLAS. On November 2, 2025, JUICE captured images of the comet shortly before its closest approach. The spacecraft observed increased activity from the comet, marking a notable moment in ongoing research.</p>
<p>The full data from JUICE's observations will be sent to Earth between February 18 and 20, 2026. The delay in data transmission is due to the use of JUICE's main high-gain antenna as a heat shield, necessitating reliance on a smaller antenna for data transmission.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The images captured by JUICE show the comet in a more active state, revealing its bright coma and two tails. The science team is excited about the data we will receive,” said an ESA spokesperson.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is believed to be up to 7 billion years old, offering insights into the history of our galaxy. Previous missions have observed the comet, but JUICE's findings will provide a more comprehensive understanding of its composition and activity.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following the analysis of the data from JUICE, scientists will be able to draw conclusions about the origins of 3I/ATLAS and its significance in the context of the Solar System's development.</p>
