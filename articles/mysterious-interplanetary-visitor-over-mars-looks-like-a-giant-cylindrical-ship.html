      <h2>Mysterious interplanetary visitor over Mars – looks like a “giant cylindrical ship”</h2>

<p>NASA's Perseverance rover has sent back extraordinary images of an interplanetary object, known as 3I/ATLAS, as it passed by Mars on its way towards the Sun. The images, recently released, depict a shape that resembles a giant cylinder, sparking various theories about its origins among scientists and astronomy enthusiasts.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it raises questions about the nature of 3I/ATLAS. While NASA and other space agencies have not yet commented on the findings, prominent astrophysicists have begun to analyze the images, leading to speculation about the object's composition and potential extraterrestrial origins.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object name: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Observation by: NASA's Perseverance rover</li>
    <li>Shape: Resembles a giant cylinder</li>
    <li>Potential diameter: Over 45 kilometers</li>
    <li>Notable analysts: Avi Loeb and Dr. Horace Drew</li>
    <li>Current status: Awaiting further analysis from Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>NASA's Perseverance rover has captured images of 3I/ATLAS as it approached Mars. The rover collected hundreds of images over a 10-minute period, showing the object’s unusual shape. Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has analyzed these images and suggested that the shape might be an optical illusion. Dr. Horace Drew has also weighed in, arguing against the comet classification.</p>
<p>As of now, higher-resolution images from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter are being processed and have not yet been released. NASA's operations have been affected by a lack of government funding, leading to a halt in their commentary on the situation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This is not a comet,” Dr. Horace Drew declared in a post on X, disputing Avi Loeb’s conclusions about 3I/ATLAS.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“NASA's shutdown is suspicious. ESA's delay is strange. But China's silence... is a sign that something is going on behind closed doors,” a social media user commented regarding the lack of information from various space agencies.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The observation of 3I/ATLAS follows the notable pass of another interstellar object, 'Oumuamua,' which came close to Earth in 2017. These occurrences have prompted renewed interest in the study of interstellar objects and their implications for our understanding of the universe.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and the European Space Agency are expected to provide more information as they analyze the data from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. The timeline for these updates remains uncertain, pending further investigation and funding availability.</p>
