      <h2>Unsettling footage shown to Congress of mysterious orb being shot by US Hellfire missile and ‘bouncing right off’</h2>

<p>Footage of what appears to be a US Hellfire missile striking a mysterious orb in Yemen was presented during a Congressional hearing on unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) on September 9, 2023. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with the video.</p>

<p>The hearing, titled “Restoring Public Trust Through UAP Transparency and Whistleblower Protection,” featured testimonies from military veterans and experts, who emphasized a lack of transparency from the federal government regarding UAP research. Chairwoman Anna Paulina Luna stated the need for greater openness to maintain public trust.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of hearing: September 9, 2023</li>
    <li>Location: United States Congress</li>
    <li>Key witnesses: Jeffery Nuccetelli, Dylan Bordland, and Alexandro Wiggins</li>
    <li>Video date: October 30, 2024</li>
    <li>Witness claim: Missile struck orb and bounced off</li>
    <li>Reported incident: Possible near-launch of Russian ICBMs in October 1982</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On September 9, 2023, a Congressional hearing focused on UAP was held. During this meeting, a video showing a missile being launched at an orb in Yemen was presented for the first time. Witnesses claimed that the missile struck the orb and did not cause any damage.</p>

<p>Witness George Knapp revealed that the footage is part of a larger collection of UAP videos that Congress has not previously seen. During the hearing, witnesses expressed concern over the implications of such phenomena.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “We cannot maintain trust in government if we keep American people in the dark,” - Anna Paulina Luna, Chairwoman of the Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “That's a Hellfire missile smacking into that UFO, and bouncing right off - and it kept going,” - George Knapp, UAP journalist.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “They split apart, they fuse back together, they'd appear and disappear,” - George Knapp, discussing UAP capabilities.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This hearing follows a growing trend of increased scrutiny and public interest in UAPs and UFOs. Previous incidents, such as the alleged near-launch of Russian ICBMs in 1982, have raised questions about national security and the potential consequences of UAP encounters. NASA has stated that it has not found credible evidence linking UAPs to extraterrestrial origins.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Congress is expected to continue its investigation into UAPs, focusing on transparency and the implications for national security. Further hearings and discussions are anticipated as lawmakers seek to address public concerns and explore the phenomena more thoroughly.</p>
