      <h2>U.S. Navy Officer Warns of Underwater UFO Threat</h2>
<p>A U.S. Navy officer has raised alarms about unidentified submerged objects (USOs) during an investigation into unexplained encounters by Navy personnel. The investigation, originally published by Popular Mechanics, highlights a series of sightings recorded over decades, primarily involving Navy pilots off the coasts of Virginia and California. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This matter has gained urgency as former military officials describe the USOs as a legitimate threat that challenges conventional understanding of physics. The U.S. military has adopted the term unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs) to categorize these objects, which have shown the ability to transition between air and water.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Lieutenant Ryan Graves has reported USO sightings since 2014.</li>
    <li>Graves observed a cube within a sphere object estimated to be 1.5 to 4.5 metres in diameter.</li>
    <li>Rear Admiral Tim Gallaudet stated, “What I saw was not our technology.”</li>
    <li>Congress passed the UAP Disclosure Act in 2023.</li>
    <li>USOs have been sighted across multiple oceans, with incidents reported as early as the 1990s.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2014, Lieutenant Ryan Graves began detecting anomalies during flight training missions off Virginia Beach. Initially dismissed as radar glitches, these signals were later confirmed through infrared and optical means.</p>
<p>In 2004, Navy pilots aboard the USS Nimitz witnessed a Tic Tac–shaped craft that dropped from 80,000 feet to sea level in under one second. In 2013, footage from Aguadilla, Puerto Rico, showed a spherical object entering the ocean without a splash.</p>
<p>In 2019, the USS Omaha recorded a spherical object hovering over the Pacific before it submerged without visible disturbance. Reports have continued into 2023, with sightings confirmed aboard the USS Jackson.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We’re at a unique moment in history,” Graves said. “People have access to tools that can reveal things. The momentum is building.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Gallaudet remarked, “No nation has craft that can move like that,” emphasizing the need for national research on these phenomena.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The military's interest in USOs reflects a growing trend of transparency regarding unidentified phenomena. The UAP Disclosure Act mandates federal agencies to catalog and analyze data related to nonhuman craft and biologics, marking a significant shift in government policy.</p>
<p>Past incidents, including a 1990s encounter involving a CH-53 Sea Stallion helicopter crew near Puerto Rico, have added to the credibility of these reports. The consistency of sightings has prompted serious political discussions about national security implications.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into USOs are ongoing, with Graves and Gallaudet briefing Washington officials about their national security implications. The push for transparency and further research into these phenomena is expected to continue as public interest grows.</p>
