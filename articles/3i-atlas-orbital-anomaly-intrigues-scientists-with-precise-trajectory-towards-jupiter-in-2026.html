      <h2>3I/ATLAS orbital anomaly intrigues scientists with precise trajectory towards Jupiter in 2026</h2>

<p>Astrophysicist Avi Loeb from Harvard University has identified a new anomaly in the trajectory of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which is set to pass close to Jupiter on March 16, 2026. The comet was discovered in July 2025 by the ATLAS system in Chile. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This anomaly is significant due to its estimated probability of 1 in 26 thousand, suggesting an unlikely orbital coincidence with Jupiter. NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) is currently monitoring 3I/ATLAS through observation campaigns involving telescopes such as Hubble and the James Webb Space Telescope.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS has an estimated diameter between 435 meters and 5.6 kilometers.</li>
    <li>It travels at speeds exceeding 60 km/s.</li>
    <li>The closest approach to Earth will occur on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet has been observed to have a gas composition rich in carbon dioxide and low in water, with only 4% water in its gaseous plume.</li>
    <li>The comet's age is estimated to be over 7.5 billion years.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS follows a hyperbolic orbit and has an inclination of just 5 degrees relative to the ecliptic plane.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025 by the ATLAS system in Chile. During its perihelion in October 2025, the comet experienced a significant impulse that altered its trajectory by 0.06 million kilometers. This change positioned it at approximately 53.445 million kilometers from the center of Jupiter, very close to the calculated Hill radius of 53.502 million kilometers.</p>
<p>NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) have coordinated efforts to capture images of the comet at multiple wavelengths, with contributions from the Perseverance rover on Mars and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, “The non-gravitational acceleration observed during perihelion adjusted the comet’s path exactly for this intersection with Jupiter.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loeb emphasized, “The low random probability of this alignment challenges our understanding of natural comet behavior.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object detected, following 1I/’Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. The comet's unique characteristics, including a high nickel-to-iron ratio and low water content, suggest that it has undergone significant alterations due to prolonged exposure to cosmic rays in the interstellar medium.</p>
<p>Data from the MAVEN mission has confirmed high levels of cyanide and nickel emissions, indicating its complex chemical history.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Experts will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth and Jupiter. Upcoming spectral observations in December 2025 are expected to provide insights into the comet’s extrasolar chemistry and further clarify its composition.</p>
