<p>A new exchange-traded fund (ETF) has emerged, focusing on companies involved in technologies related to unidentified flying objects (UFOs), according to a report released this week. The ETF aims to capitalize on the ongoing discourse surrounding UFO disclosures and government investigations into aerial phenomena.</p>

<p>This initiative highlights the increasing public and governmental interest in UFOs, especially following recent disclosures from the U.S. government. Authorities are taking steps to investigate and disclose more information about aerial phenomena, which may impact various sectors of the economy.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>

    <li>The ETF has launched in October 2023.</li>
    <li>It targets companies engaged in aerospace, defense, and advanced technology sectors.</li>
    <li>Recent U.S. government reports have acknowledged the need for further investigation into UFO sightings.</li>
    <li>The fund aims to attract investors interested in the intersection of technology and extraterrestrial phenomena.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In June 2021, the U.S. government released a report on UFO sightings, prompting increased scrutiny and interest in the subject. In the months that followed, several testimonies from military personnel regarding their encounters with aerial phenomena have surfaced.</p>
