      <h2>Harvard Physicist Claims 3I/ATLAS Object Is 'Not Natural': Why He Is Baffled</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has claimed that the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS may not be of natural origin, citing unusual characteristics observed during its journey through the Solar System. Loeb shared his insights on his blog, highlighting jets and an 'anti-tail' associated with the comet, as well as recently detected radio waves.</p>

<p>This claim has sparked debate among astronomers regarding the nature of 3I/ATLAS. While Loeb suggests the presence of alien technology, other experts, including Qicheng Zhang from the Lowell Observatory, argue that the comet exhibits typical behaviour for a comet and does not show signs of breaking apart.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Avi Loeb proposes that jets from 3I/ATLAS may indicate an alien spacecraft.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS passed close to the Sun on 28 October 2025.</li>
    <li>Images taken on 11 November 2025 show a single body of the comet.</li>
    <li>The comet will make its closest approach to Earth on 19 December 2025.</li>
    <li>Loeb rates 3I/ATLAS a 6 on his "Loeb Scale" for interstellar objects.</li>
    <li>Qicheng Zhang describes the comet as "fairly ordinary/healthy looking."</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in 2019 and has since been a subject of interest due to its unusual movements. On 28 October 2025, the comet passed close to the Sun, an event known as perihelion passage. Subsequent images taken on 11 November 2025 revealed that the comet remains intact and has not broken apart, contrary to some expectations.</p>

<p>Loeb's observations have raised questions about the comet's behaviour, particularly the jets and radio waves detected. The comet is set to make its closest approach to Earth on 19 December 2025, prompting further scrutiny from scientists.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Given that the large-scale jets reported recently, the fact that 3I/ATLAS remains a single body is surprising for a natural comet,” said Loeb.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“All the images I've seen show a fairly ordinary/healthy looking comet. There's no sign at all that the nucleus broke apart,” stated Qicheng Zhang.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discussion surrounding 3I/ATLAS follows a broader interest in interstellar objects, particularly after the discovery of 'Oumuamua in 2017. This interest has led to increased scrutiny of such objects, with scientists debating their origins and characteristics.</p>

<p>Loeb's claims are not universally accepted, as many astronomers caution against jumping to conclusions without sufficient evidence. Zhang's critique of Loeb's interpretation highlights the ongoing debate within the scientific community.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth, astronomers will continue to monitor its behaviour and gather data. The upcoming close approach on 19 December 2025 may provide further insights into the comet's characteristics and the validity of the claims made by Loeb and others.</p>
