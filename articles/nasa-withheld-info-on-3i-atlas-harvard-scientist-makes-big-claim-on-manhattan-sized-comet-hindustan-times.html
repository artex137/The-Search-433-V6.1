      <h2>NASA withheld info on 3I/ATLAS; Harvard scientist makes big claim on Manhattan-sized comet</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has alleged that NASA has withheld information regarding the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which is set for its closest approach to the Sun on Wednesday, October 2, 2025. The comet will pass within 18 million miles (29 million kilometers) of Mars on Friday, traveling at a speed of 193,000 mph (310,000 kph).</p>

<p>This situation has raised concerns within the scientific community. Loeb, speaking on The Joe Rogan Experience, claimed NASA has not publicly released a photograph of 3I/ATLAS taken by the HiRISE camera aboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. NASA has not confirmed the existence of this image or responded to the allegations of withholding information.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is expected to pass Mars on Friday, October 2, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet is traveling at a speed of 193,000 mph (310,000 kph).</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb claims NASA has not released images of the comet captured by the HiRISE camera.</li>
    <li>NASA's official stance is that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth.</li>
    <li>A comet campaign will take place from November 27, 2025, to January 27, 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Avi Loeb discussed 3I/ATLAS on The Joe Rogan Experience, where he made claims about NASA withholding information. He noted that the best image of the comet was obtained on October 2, 2025, when it was within 30 million kilometers of Mars. He stated he had requested access to the data from the HiRISE principal investigator but received no response.</p>

<p>Loeb raised concerns about NASA’s characterization of the comet, suggesting that the agency's claims could be misleading. He has long posited that 3I/ATLAS may have extraterrestrial origins due to its unusual characteristics.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It’s much more likely not to be related to extraterrestrial intelligence, but to terrestrial stupidity,” said Loeb regarding NASA's lack of communication.</blockquote>

<blockquote>NASA has stated that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth and could help scientists understand hazardous space objects.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third known interstellar object to pass through our solar system. Loeb has pointed to its anomalous acceleration and unique trajectory as evidence of its unusual nature. He has also noted the comet emits a plume of nickel without iron, a phenomenon not seen in other comets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and the International Asteroid Warning Network will lead a “comet campaign” from November 27, 2025, to January 27, 2026, aimed at improving detection and monitoring methods for such objects.</p>
