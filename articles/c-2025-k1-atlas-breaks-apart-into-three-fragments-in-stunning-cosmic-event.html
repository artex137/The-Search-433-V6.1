      <h2>C/2025 K1 ATLAS Breaks Apart into Three Fragments in Stunning Cosmic Event</h2>

<p>Astronomers worldwide are tracking Comet C/2025 K1 ATLAS after it shattered into three visible fragments during its recent passage near the Sun. The breakup occurred following a close solar encounter in early October, which pushed the comet to its structural limits, according to scientists.</p>

<p>This event matters because it offers rare insights into comet behaviour and evolution. Observers have captured images showing the comet's colours, structural changes, and unique behaviour, sparking significant scientific interest. The fragmentation could also enhance visibility for skywatchers as the comet approaches Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet C/2025 K1 ATLAS split into three fragments on November 11.</li>
    <li>The breakup followed a close pass by the Sun in early October.</li>
    <li>Images from telescopes in multiple countries captured the event.</li>
    <li>The primary fragment remains the brightest and most stable.</li>
    <li>Dust production has increased, potentially enhancing visibility for observers.</li>
    <li>Previous observations noted a colour shift from green to gold as it approached the Sun.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In early October, Comet C/2025 K1 ATLAS made a close pass by the Sun. Astronomers noted a greenish hue created by vaporising carbon-based molecules. As it neared the Sun, the comet's colour shifted to warmer golden tones.</p>

<p>On November 11, the comet broke apart into three fragments, each drifting at slightly different speeds. The primary nucleus remains the brightest, while the two smaller pieces exhibit fainter trails.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The fragmentation of C/2025 K1 ATLAS is especially striking because the comet had shown resilience just days earlier,” a researcher noted. “This abrupt fragmentation makes the event even more unusual and scientifically valuable.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident is not the first of its kind. Comet fragmentation typically marks the end of a comet's life cycle, although some fragments can persist long enough to create brief displays as they approach Earth. Previous comets have also displayed similar behaviour, often resulting in the disintegration of their nuclei.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers are monitoring the behaviour of the fragments over the coming days to determine their stability and visibility. The ongoing observations will help researchers understand whether the fragments will persist or dissolve completely as they travel through space.</p>
