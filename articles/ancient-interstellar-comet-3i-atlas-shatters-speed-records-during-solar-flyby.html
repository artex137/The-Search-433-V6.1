      <h2>Ancient interstellar comet 3I/Atlas shatters speed records during solar flyby</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/Atlas has reached a record-breaking speed of 61 kilometers per second as it passed closest to the Sun last week, captivating astronomers with its extraordinary characteristics. Discovered as the third confirmed interstellar visitor, this ancient comet is estimated to be between 5 and 7 billion years old, significantly predating the formation of our Solar System, which is about 4.6 billion years old.</p>

<p>The comet’s rapid journey through our Solar System presents a rare opportunity for scientists to gain insights into the history of planetary systems beyond our own. According to a 2023 report by the International Astronomical Union, interstellar objects like 3I/Atlas are extremely rare, making each passage an invaluable moment for observation and data collection.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Comet 3I/Atlas reached a speed of 61 kilometers per second.</li>
<li>The comet is estimated to be 5 to 7 billion years old.</li>
<li>It reached its closest point to the Sun at a distance of approximately 127 million miles.</li>
<li>The closest approach to Earth will occur on December 19 at about 168 million miles away.</li>
<li>The comet's origin is deep within the central region of the Milky Way.</li>
<li>NASA’s Europa Clipper probe will pass through the comet’s tail in December 2024.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/Atlas has been a focus for professional astronomers since its discovery. Last week, it reached its perihelion, or closest point to the Sun, at a distance of about 127 million miles. The comet is set to make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2024, at approximately 1.8 astronomical units, or 168 million miles away.</p>

<p>This upcoming encounter with NASA’s Europa Clipper probe, which is currently en route to Jupiter’s moon Europa, marks a significant milestone in interstellar studies. The probe is expected to collect and analyze interstellar material from the comet's tail, providing new data on planetary formation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Its velocity reaches an unprecedented 38 miles per second, marking the highest speed ever documented for a comet,” said Emerson Roberto Perez, an astronomer at the Urânia Planetarium. “Studying pristine interstellar matter up close is transformative for astrobiology and our understanding of life’s potential distribution,” added NASA’s Dr. Lisa Nguyen.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interstellar comets like 3I/Atlas are rare visitors to our Solar System. Their unique compositions, originating from distant regions of the Milky Way, provide insights into the processes that shape planetary systems. The study of such objects is crucial for understanding the formation and evolution of worlds beyond our immediate cosmic neighborhood.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As December approaches, astronomers will prepare for the close encounter between the Europa Clipper probe and comet 3I/Atlas. This event is anticipated to yield important findings regarding the building blocks of planets and the distribution of organic compounds in the galaxy.</p>
