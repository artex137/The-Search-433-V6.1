      <h2>Mysterious 'alien spaceship' 3I/ATLAS shows pulsating heartbeat as it approaches Earth</h2>

<p>The object known as 3I/ATLAS, described by some as an "alien spaceship," has exhibited a rhythmic "heartbeat" as it travels through the solar system. NASA has classified it as a comet since its detection on July 1, 2025. This discovery has sparked interest among scientists, particularly astrophysicist Avi Loeb, who has closely monitored the object.</p>

<p>The significance of 3I/ATLAS lies in its unique characteristics, which may provide insights into its true nature. Authorities, including NASA and the European Space Agency, are preparing for its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, which could mark a pivotal moment in the study of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object Name: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Discovery Date: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Closest Approach to Earth: December 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Minimum Distance from Earth: 269 million kilometers</li>
    <li>NASA's Juno spacecraft will probe 3I/ATLAS on March 16, 2026, at a distance of 53 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Current Distance from ESA's Juice spacecraft: 64 million kilometers</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2025, and has since been observed exhibiting non-gravitational acceleration, which has puzzled scientists. In November 2025, Avi Loeb disclosed that the object would reach its nearest point to Earth on December 19, 2025. He noted that the object displayed multiple jets and a pulsating variability in its light, suggesting a possible "heartbeat" pattern.</p>

<p>NASA's Juno spacecraft is scheduled to gather data from 3I/ATLAS on March 16, 2026, while ESA's Juice spacecraft is currently positioned 64 million kilometers away from the object.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "This multi-jet structure constitutes a remarkable target for future observations with the Hubble and Webb telescopes." He added, "It is therefore unlikely that particle probes on Earth-based satellites will be able to capture particles from these jets."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS follows a trend of increasing interest in interstellar objects. Scientists have been keen to study these bodies for insights into the formation and evolution of the solar system. The unique characteristics of 3I/ATLAS, particularly its pulsating jets, have raised questions about its origin and nature.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth, NASA and other agencies will continue to monitor the object. Future observations with advanced telescopes are anticipated, while the capabilities of Earth-based satellites to capture data from its jets remain uncertain.</p>
