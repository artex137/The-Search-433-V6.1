      <h2>3I/ATLAS is a comet, not aliens, NASA says</h2>

<p>The US space agency NASA has confirmed that the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS is a comet and not of extraterrestrial origin. The announcement was made following the object's recent close pass by Mars last month.</p>

<p>This clarification is significant as it addresses widespread speculation about the nature of 3I/ATLAS, which arose during the US government shutdown that limited NASA's ability to respond to inquiries. NASA has provided fresh images of the comet and emphasized its characteristics, asserting that it behaves like a comet and showing no signs of being anything else.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object name: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: 167 million miles (269 million kilometers) in mid-December</li>
    <li>First observed: July 2023</li>
    <li>Scientific platforms used: Hubble, James Webb, and satellites orbiting Mars</li>
    <li>NASA officials involved: Amit Kshatriya, Nicola Fox, Tom Statler</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first spotted in July 2023 by a telescope in Chile. The object zipped past Mars in October 2023, prompting NASA to conduct extensive studies using multiple scientific platforms. NASA released new images of the comet on Wednesday, clarifying its nature after speculation arose during the US government shutdown.</p>

<p>NASA officials have confirmed that the object behaves like a comet based on observations made by various telescopes and satellites.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This object is a comet. It looks and behaves like a comet. And all evidence points to it being a comet,”</blockquote>
<p>Amit Kshatriya, NASA associate administrator.</p>

<blockquote>“We certainly haven't seen any technosignatures or anything from it that would lead us to believe it was anything other than a comet,”</blockquote>
<p>Nicola Fox, associate administrator of NASA's Science Mission Directorate.</p>

<blockquote>“It gives me goose bumps to think about... a window into the deep past and so deep in the past that it predates even the formation of our Earth and our sun,”</blockquote>
<p>Tom Statler, NASA scientist.</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The confusion about 3I/ATLAS's nature highlights the public's interest in the search for extraterrestrial life. NASA has been actively exploring the universe for signs of life, but this particular object has been confirmed as a comet, not an alien spacecraft.</p>

<p>NASA's observations have utilized advanced technology, including the Hubble and James Webb space telescopes, reinforcing the agency's commitment to studying interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it moves away from the solar system and approaches its closest point to Earth in December. The agency aims to provide further updates on the comet's journey and visibility from Earth.</p>
