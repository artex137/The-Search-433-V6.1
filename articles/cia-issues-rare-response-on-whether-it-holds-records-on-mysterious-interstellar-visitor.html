      <h2>CIA issues rare response on whether it holds records on mysterious interstellar visitor</h2>

<p>The CIA has acknowledged it can neither confirm nor deny the existence of records related to 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar object currently traversing the solar system, in response to a November 2025 Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. The agency's statement has raised new questions about the nature of the object, which NASA has classified as a comet since its detection in July 2025.</p>

<p>This development is significant as it indicates potential government interest in the object’s origins. Harvard professor Avi Loeb has suggested that the CIA's response hints at a possible investigation into whether 3I/ATLAS could be an extraterrestrial craft. Meanwhile, NASA has maintained its position that the object is of natural origin.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Detection:</strong> July 2025</li>
    <li><strong>FOIA request submitted:</strong> November 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to Jupiter:</strong> March 16, 2026</li>
    <li><strong>Key figures:</strong> Avi Loeb, John Greenewald Jr.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was detected in July 2025, initially identified by NASA as a comet. In November 2025, John Greenewald Jr. submitted a FOIA request to the CIA seeking information about the object. The CIA responded with a statement that it could neither confirm nor deny the existence of records related to 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<p>On November 19, 2025, NASA held a press conference where officials asserted that 3I/ATLAS is definitely a comet of natural origin. Despite this, the CIA's response has led to speculation about whether the object might be a threat, as suggested by Loeb.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “That this information is treated as sensitive enough to be classified by the CIA is surprising, given that NASA officials stated decisively... that 3I/ATLAS is definitely a comet of natural origin,” said Avi Loeb.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "Very interesting, apparently CIA [director John] Ratcliffe knows something," commented one social media user regarding the CIA's response.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The CIA's use of a "Glomar response" is a strategy employed to avoid revealing sensitive information. In the past, the U.S. government has faced scrutiny over its handling of UFO-related information. Public interest in 3I/ATLAS has intensified, particularly following NASA's November announcement, which some critics have described as inadequate.</p>

<p>Amateur astronomers have captured clearer images of 3I/ATLAS than those released by NASA, prompting discussions about transparency and the validity of government claims regarding the object.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>John Greenewald Jr. has indicated he will file an appeal for more information from the CIA and has submitted similar requests to NASA and other U.S. agencies. The situation remains under observation as 3I/ATLAS approaches Jupiter in March 2026.</p>
