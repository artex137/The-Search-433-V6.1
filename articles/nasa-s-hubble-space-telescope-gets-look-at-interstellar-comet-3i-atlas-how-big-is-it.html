      <h2>NASA's Hubble Space Telescope observes interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>
<p>NASA's Hubble Space Telescope has captured images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, providing valuable insights into its size and structure. The observations occurred in late October 2023 as the comet passed through our solar system.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as it allows scientists to learn more about the composition of interstellar objects, which can offer clues about the formation of our solar system. Hubble's data may help researchers understand the origins of comets and their role in delivering water and organic materials to planets.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was observed by Hubble in late October 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet is approximately 1.2 kilometers in diameter.</li>
    <li>Hubble's observations are part of ongoing research into interstellar objects.</li>
    <li>The comet is expected to make its closest approach to the Sun in 2024.</li>
    <li>NASA's Hubble Space Telescope is managed by the Space Telescope Science Institute.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Hubble captured images of 3I/ATLAS during its trajectory through the solar system in late October 2023. The comet is believed to have originated from another star system, making it a rare subject of study.</p>
<p>The observations are part of a larger effort by NASA to monitor interstellar objects, providing insights into their characteristics as they pass through our solar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“These observations of 3I/ATLAS are crucial for understanding the nature of interstellar comets,” said a NASA spokesperson. “Hubble's capabilities allow us to gather data that can be analyzed for years to come.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I/ATLAS, the first interstellar object observed in our solar system was ‘Oumuamua in 2017. Its unusual shape and behavior sparked significant interest and debate among scientists regarding the nature of interstellar visitors.</p>
<p>The study of comets like 3I/ATLAS helps researchers piece together the history and evolution of celestial bodies, enhancing our understanding of the universe.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA plans to continue monitoring the trajectory of 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun in 2024, with further observations expected to yield more insights into its composition and behavior.</p>
