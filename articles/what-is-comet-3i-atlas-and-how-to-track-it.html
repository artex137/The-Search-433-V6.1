      <h2>What is Comet 3I/Atlas and how to track it</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/Atlas has reached its perihelion, the point where it comes closest to the Sun, on November 7, 2025. After this, the comet will begin moving away from the solar system at an incredible speed of around 210,000 kilometers per hour, eventually leaving our solar system by January 2026. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to the comet.</p>

<p>This event is significant for astronomers as 3I/Atlas is believed to have originated from outside our solar system, offering a rare opportunity to study material from distant stars. Authorities have confirmed that no planetary defense system was activated because the comet poses no threat to Earth. On December 19, 3I/Atlas will pass approximately 270 million kilometers from Earth, making it roughly 700 times farther than the Moon.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas reached perihelion on November 7, 2025.</li>
    <li>It will travel at around 210,000 kilometers per hour.</li>
    <li>The comet will leave the solar system by January 2026.</li>
    <li>It will pass 270 million kilometers from Earth on December 19.</li>
    <li>No planetary defense measures have been activated.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 7, 2025, Comet 3I/Atlas reached its perihelion, marking its closest approach to the Sun. Following this event, it will begin its rapid exit from the solar system.</p>

<p>On December 19, 2025, the comet will pass at a distance of approximately 270 million kilometers from Earth, which is not close enough for visibility without telescopes.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Everything indicates it will continue its calm journey through the solar system before disappearing into deep space forever,” said an astronomer involved in the study of the comet.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/Atlas is a unique object due to its origin from outside our solar system. Its composition and age provide valuable insights into the materials that exist beyond our solar system. This is not the first instance of interstellar objects passing through our solar system; however, 3I/Atlas offers a rare chance for detailed study.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will use powerful telescopes to study Comet 3I/Atlas during its approach, despite it being invisible to the naked eye. Real-time tracking will be available online through various platforms, including NASA's Eyes on the Solar System simulator.</p>
