      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS shows unusual activity ahead of close approach</h2>

<p>Observers across the globe have tracked interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it exhibits unusual activity ahead of its closest approach to Earth on December 19. The comet has shown erratic behavior and increased brightness since its perihelion, according to reports from the Virtual Telescope Project and other sources.</p>

<p>This observation window is critical for scientists to determine whether 3I/ATLAS is a natural comet or something more unusual. Agencies including the European Space Agency and NASA are coordinating efforts to gather fresh imaging data while the comet remains bright and close enough for detailed analysis.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2023</li>
    <li>Observation window: 33 days prior to closest approach</li>
    <li>Live stream of observations begins at 11:15 p.m. ET from Manciano, Italy</li>
    <li>Confirmed non-gravitational acceleration observed</li>
    <li>More than 100 observatories participating in monitoring</li>
    <li>NASA has not released HiRISE images from early October</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected streaking in from deep space, prompting a series of observations to study its characteristics. Since its perihelion, the comet has exhibited unexpected behavior, including increased brightness and erratic jet activity. As its closest approach date nears, a coordinated global effort has commenced to gather data on the comet's properties.</p>

<p>As of tonight, major observatories including Webb, Hubble, and ESA’s Juice spacecraft are set to join the monitoring campaign. Their data will provide insights into the object’s thermal properties, rotation, and jet behavior.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“What we learn between now and December 19 will decide whether 3I/ATLAS becomes the third known interstellar comet—or the first interstellar artifact,” said Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The behavior of 3I/ATLAS is unprecedented in the historical record of comets. Its brightening after perihelion contradicts typical cometary behavior. Observations suggest that its jets and acceleration patterns may not align with natural explanations, raising questions about its composition and origin.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As more observations are conducted, researchers will analyze the data to better understand 3I/ATLAS. The outcomes of these studies will influence ongoing discussions in the scientific community regarding the nature of this interstellar visitor.</p>
