      <h2>Will 3I/ATLAS Hit Earth? Here's What Could Happen</h2>

<p>Astronomers and space agencies are monitoring 3I/ATLAS, a rare interstellar object discovered on 1 July 2025 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope in Chile. NASA has confirmed that 3I/ATLAS poses no immediate threat to Earth, but its unusual trajectory has raised concerns among scientists about potential impact scenarios.</p>

<p>This situation is significant as it highlights the importance of cosmic risk assessment. Although current data indicate no collision risk, 3I/ATLAS has been added to the global planetary-defence monitoring list, allowing researchers to use it as a test case for future threats.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered: 1 July 2025</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: Approximately 1.8 astronomical units (∼270 million km)</li>
    <li>Closest point to the Sun: Scheduled for 30 October 2025 at about 1.4 AU (∼210 million km)</li>
    <li>Estimated diameter: Between 440 metres and 5.6 kilometres</li>
    <li>Classification: Comet, not an asteroid</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 1 July 2025, the ATLAS telescope in Chile discovered 3I/ATLAS. Since then, NASA and other space agencies have monitored the object to assess its trajectory and potential risks. As of now, 3I/ATLAS will approach no closer than 1.8 astronomical units from Earth, with its closest point to the Sun expected around 30 October 2025.</p>

<p>Researchers have noted that although 3I/ATLAS has a hyperbolic trajectory indicating it came from outside the Solar System, there is no data supporting a collision risk with Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Though 3I/ATLAS is not on a collision path, it serves as a reminder of what cosmic objects can do and why preparedness matters,” NASA stated regarding the monitoring of the object.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>NASA classifies 3I/ATLAS as a comet due to its activity, which includes a coma—a cloud of gas and dust. Comets differ from asteroids, which are mainly rocky and do not exhibit such outgassing. The presence of ice and the development of a dust shell as it approaches the Sun further substantiate its classification as a comet.</p>

<p>Prior to 3I/ATLAS, other interstellar objects have been observed, but this particular object provides a unique opportunity for scientific discovery and planetary defence preparation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and other agencies will continue to observe 3I/ATLAS to gather data that may improve forecasting models for potential future threats. The ongoing monitoring is crucial for understanding cosmic risks and enhancing early-warning systems.</p>
