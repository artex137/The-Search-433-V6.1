      <h2>Harvard’s Avi Loeb: Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS May Be Alien Tech</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has raised questions about the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, first observed on July 1, 2025, as it approaches Earth. The object, unlike typical comets or asteroids, appears to generate its own light, which has sparked debate amongst astronomers about its origins and composition.</p>

<p>This phenomenon matters because it challenges existing understandings of celestial bodies and may imply advanced technology. Authorities and researchers are closely monitoring the object, which could provide insights into both natural and artificial phenomena as it nears its closest point to Earth in October 2025.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object designation: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>First observed: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>High-resolution image captured: July 21, 2025</li>
    <li>Estimated size: up to 1 kilometre across</li>
    <li>Predicted closest approach to Earth: October 2025</li>
    <li>Speed: over 160,000 kilometres per hour</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers first spotted 3I/ATLAS as it entered the solar system. A high-resolution image taken by the Hubble Space Telescope on July 21 revealed a fuzzy glow around the object, resembling a comet's coma. This glow's unusual position ahead of the object raised questions about its nature.</p>
<p>Loeb proposed that the glow might indicate self-generated light, possibly from artificial sources, challenging the classification of 3I/ATLAS as a typical comet. As the object approaches Mars in October 2025, scientists are preparing for more observations to gather data on its composition and behavior.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb, in his Medium post, stated, "If the glow isn’t from a natural coma, it might stem from nuclear reactions or even artificial lighting, akin to a spacecraft’s headlights."</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loeb also emphasized the importance of interdisciplinary approaches, urging, "We must avoid scientific gatekeeping to explore all possibilities." </blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the largest interstellar object observed to date, offering a unique opportunity for scientific study. Its trajectory and characteristics defy typical comet behavior, prompting discussions about the potential for advanced propulsion technology. Previous observations of interstellar objects have not generated similar levels of debate or scrutiny.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth, NASA's Hubble and the James Webb Space Telescope will conduct further observations. Researchers aim to confirm or refute the hypothesis of self-generated light and understand the object's implications for future space exploration and technology.</p>
