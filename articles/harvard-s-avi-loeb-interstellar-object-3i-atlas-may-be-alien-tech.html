      <h2>Harvard’s Avi Loeb: Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS May Be Alien Tech</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has proposed that the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, first observed on July 1, 2025, may be generating its own light, igniting discussions about its origins. The object, which is currently traveling through our solar system, has attracted the attention of astronomers worldwide due to its unusual characteristics.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as it challenges existing classifications of celestial bodies. Loeb's analysis raises questions about the nature of 3I/ATLAS, suggesting it may not be a typical comet or asteroid. Observations from the Hubble Space Telescope have shown a glow from the object that could indicate artificial origins, prompting further investigation from the scientific community.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was first spotted on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>The object is estimated to be up to 1 kilometer across, making it the largest interstellar visitor observed to date.</li>
    <li>High-resolution images from the Hubble Space Telescope were taken on July 21, 2025.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is traveling at speeds exceeding 160,000 kilometers per hour.</li>
    <li>Loeb's "Loeb Scale" rates the object at 6 out of 10 for potential technological origins.</li>
    <li>The object is expected to pass near Mars in October 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers first detected 3I/ATLAS as it approached the solar system. Subsequently, a high-resolution image was captured by the Hubble Space Telescope on July 21, revealing a glow indicative of possible self-generated light. Following these observations, Loeb published analyses suggesting that the object may possess artificial characteristics, diverging from typical comet behavior.</p>

<p>As discussions around the object's origins gained traction, Loeb’s theories, which include the possibility of nuclear propulsion, sparked both interest and skepticism among the scientific community. The object is expected to reach its closest point to Earth near Mars in October 2025, prompting further observations.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The glow’s position ahead of the object’s motion defies conventional comet behavior,” Loeb stated in his Medium analysis. “If the glow isn’t from a natural coma, it might stem from nuclear reactions or even artificial lighting.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>Loeb emphasized the importance of open-minded inquiry, stating, “We must avoid scientific gatekeeping to not miss paradigm-shifting discoveries.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The study of interstellar objects like 3I/ATLAS is relatively new, with few previous incidents of similar significance. The scientific community has previously debated various celestial anomalies, but the potential for artificial origins in 3I/ATLAS adds a new layer of intrigue. As the object approaches Earth, the implications for space exploration and understanding advanced propulsion systems could be profound.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS nears its closest point to Earth, NASA’s Hubble and the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope are set to provide further observations. These studies may confirm or refute Loeb's hypotheses regarding the object's light generation and origins. International collaboration will be crucial as agencies like ESA and private firms like SpaceX may play a role in future investigations.</p>
