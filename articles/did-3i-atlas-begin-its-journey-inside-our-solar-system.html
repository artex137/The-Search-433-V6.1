      <p class="byline">Published 2026-01-23 15:51 UTC</p>

      <h2>Did 3I/ATLAS Begin Its Journey Inside Our Solar System?</h2>

<p>On January 23, 2026, Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb published an essay exploring whether the comet 3I/ATLAS originated within the Solar System. This assertion challenges long-held beliefs about interstellar objects and raises important questions about their detection and significance.</p>

<p>The implications of Loeb's hypothesis are significant for the fields of astronomy and planetary defense. Observational data suggest that 3I/ATLAS exhibits characteristics that could indicate a local origin rather than a journey of millions of years from another star system. Authorities in the scientific community are examining these findings closely, as they may reshape our understanding of deep-space activity.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>3I/ATLAS is estimated to exceed 1 billion tons.</li>
<li>The object approached within approximately 1.36 astronomical units (AU) of the Sun.</li>
<li>Neptune orbits at about 30 AU from the Sun.</li>
<li>Loeb's analysis indicates an anomaly in the detection rate of large interstellar objects.</li>
<li>The detection bias limits visibility to objects within approximately 20 AU.</li>
<li>Loeb has previously published work on distinguishing artificial light sources from natural ones.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2026, Avi Loeb published an essay questioning the origin of 3I/ATLAS. He posited that the object may have launched from within the Solar System, rather than traveling from another star system. The analysis highlights a statistical tension regarding the frequency of large interstellar objects and suggests that if 3I/ATLAS originated locally, it reconciles the discrepancies noted by astronomers.</p>

<p>Loeb also noted unusual geometric and compositional features of 3I/ATLAS, such as its trajectory, rotation axis, and a high nickel-to-iron ratio, which add to the complexity of its classification. These observations have prompted renewed discussions about the nature of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The Sun acts like a lamppost, and humanity can only find objects that wander into its light,” Loeb stated, emphasizing the limitations of current detection methods.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Loeb further explained, “If technological objects are deliberately positioned beyond our detection range, their apparent absence tells us very little.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to this analysis, the scientific community viewed interstellar objects like 3I/ATLAS as rare visitors from other star systems. The conventional wisdom has been challenged by recent discoveries that suggest a more frequent occurrence of such objects. These findings may point to gaps in our observational capabilities and understanding of the Solar System.</p>

<p>Loeb's hypothesis opens up discussions about the potential for advanced civilizations operating beyond Neptune, hidden in the Kuiper Belt or Oort Cloud. This reframing of the Fermi Paradox—why we have not found evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence—suggests that our detection methods may be inherently flawed.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Ongoing observations of 3I/ATLAS will continue to test Loeb's hypothesis. Scientists aim to monitor the object for non-gravitational acceleration and unusual light signatures. Improved tracking and analysis could provide clarity on the nature of 3I/ATLAS and its implications for our understanding of the Solar System.</p>
