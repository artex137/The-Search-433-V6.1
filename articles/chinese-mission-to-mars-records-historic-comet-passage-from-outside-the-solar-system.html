      <h2>Chinese mission to Mars records historic comet passage from outside the Solar System</h2>

<p>The Administração Espacial Nacional of China has released records from the Tianwen-1 probe, which has captured detailed images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS during its closest approach to Mars in October 2025. The observations were made from approximately 30 million kilometers away, with no reported injuries or fatalities.</p>

<p>This event marks a significant achievement in space exploration, demonstrating the adaptability of Chinese instruments originally designed for Martian studies. The successful tracking of 3I/ATLAS enhances understanding of interstellar objects and their origins, according to the mission control team in Pequim.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope system in Chile.</li>
    <li>The comet's diameter is estimated at 5.6 kilometers.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar visitor, following Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019.</li>
    <li>The comet traveled at a relative speed of 58 kilometers per second during observations.</li>
    <li>The Tianwen-1 mission began preparations for the observation in September 2025.</li>
    <li>The European Space Agency (ESA) and NASA also participated in the observation efforts.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the ATLAS telescope system discovered comet 3I/ATLAS. In September 2025, the Tianwen-1 mission control team in Pequim began preparations for detailed observations. The closest approach occurred in October 2025, where the probe successfully captured images and spectral data from a distance of 30 million kilometers.</p>

<p>The operation involved complex orbital forecasts and precise navigation to track the comet's high-speed trajectory. The images collected provided unprecedented detail about the comet's physical structure and chemical composition.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The success of this operation served as a crucial practical test for the tracking systems that will be used in the next stages of the Chinese space program,” said a spokesperson from the Administração Espacial Nacional.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This mission follows previous groundbreaking observations of interstellar objects, including Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. The collaboration between multiple space agencies, including ESA and NASA, underscores the growing global interest in studying celestial bodies from beyond the Solar System.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The data obtained from this mission will inform the navigation and autonomous operations of future missions, particularly the Tianwen-2 mission, which aims to collect samples from asteroids and explore comets in the main belt.</p>
