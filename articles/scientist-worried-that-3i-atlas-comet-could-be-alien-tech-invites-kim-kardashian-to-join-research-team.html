      <h2>Scientist worried that 3I/ATLAS comet could be alien tech invites Kim Kardashian to join research team</h2>

<p>Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist, has invited Kim Kardashian to join his research team to study the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which he believes may be fueled by alien technology. The invitation follows Kardashian's inquiry to NASA regarding the comet, which is set to make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to the comet.</p>

<p>This matter has gained attention as scientists, including Loeb, have struggled to access crucial data about 3I/ATLAS due to a government shutdown that has lasted for 35 days. NASA's acting administrator, Sean Duffy, has assured that there is no threat to life on Earth from the comet, yet scientists are eager for data to determine its true nature before it exits the solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is expected to pass closest to Earth on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet has been observed shedding nickel and has a high nickel-iron ratio.</li>
    <li>The government shutdown has lasted 35 days, affecting data availability.</li>
    <li>NASA's acting administrator is Sean Duffy, who also serves as the US Secretary of Transportation.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb has noted at least 10 anomalies in the comet's behaviour.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In October 2025, NASA's HiRISE camera captured high-resolution images of 3I/ATLAS on the 2nd and 3rd, but scientists have not been able to analyze this data due to the ongoing government shutdown. On November 1, Kardashian tweeted to Duffy asking for information on the comet, prompting his quick response that assured her of no alien threat.</p>

<p>Loeb and other scientists have expressed frustration over the lack of access to critical data, which they believe could help clarify the comet's unusual characteristics. On the same day Duffy responded to Kardashian, US Representative Ana Paulina Luna sent a letter to Duffy requesting the release of the withheld data.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The dissemination of scientific information should not be held hostage to the politics of the government shutdown,” Loeb wrote in a blog post on Monday.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“We should be humble about the little we know and curious about 3I/ATLAS rather than insist that we know its nature before data is shared and analyzed,” Loeb added.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“@NASA’s observations show that this is the third interstellar comet to pass through our solar system. No aliens. No threat to life here on Earth,” Duffy stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This situation comes amid a broader conversation about transparency in scientific research, particularly during government shutdowns. The inability to access data has raised concerns among scientists and lawmakers about the implications for ongoing research and public safety regarding celestial objects.</p>

<p>Loeb has highlighted the potential significance of 3I/ATLAS, noting its trajectory and composition could suggest technological origins rather than natural phenomena. Previous instances of interstellar objects have also sparked debate among experts about their origins and implications for understanding the universe.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists await a resolution to the government shutdown to access the necessary data for analyzing 3I/ATLAS. The urgency increases as the comet approaches its closest flyby, and both Loeb and Luna are advocating for a prompt response to their inquiries.</p>
