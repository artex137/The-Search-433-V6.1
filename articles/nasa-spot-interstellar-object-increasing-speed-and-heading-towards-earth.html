      <h2>NASA spots interstellar object ‘increasing speed’ and heading towards Earth</h2>

<p>NASA has detected an interstellar comet, 3I/ATLAS, that is accelerating as it approaches Earth. The comet, discovered earlier this year, has been traveling through space for millions of years and recently reached its closest point to the sun on October 30, 2023. It is currently moving at approximately 244,000 kilometers per hour (152,000 miles per hour), an increase from 220,000 kilometers per hour (137,000 miles per hour) when it was first identified.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it marks the third interstellar comet to enter the solar system. NASA has stated that there is no cause for concern regarding the object, which will come no closer than 170 million miles (270 million kilometers) from Earth. The agency reassured the public that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to our planet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet name: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Current speed: 244,000 km/h (152,000 mph)</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: 170 million miles (270 million kilometers)</li>
    <li>Closest point to the sun: October 30, 2023</li>
    <li>Next closest point to the sun: October 30, 2025, at 130 million miles (210 million kilometers)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered earlier this year while traveling through the solar system. It reached its closest point to the sun on October 30, 2023. Since then, its speed has increased, prompting further observation and analysis by NASA.</p>

<p>NASA officials reported the comet's increasing speed and its trajectory, clarifying that it will not pose any danger to Earth. The agency plans to continue monitoring the comet as it moves through the solar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    <p>"Comet 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth and will remain far away. The closest it will approach our planet is about 1.8 astronomical units (about 170 million miles, or 270 million kilometers)." - NASA</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>"We love your excitement about our Artemis mission to the Moon. You’re officially invited to launch at Kennedy Space Center!" - Sean Duffy, NASA’s acting administrator</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The detection of 3I/ATLAS adds to the growing body of knowledge regarding interstellar objects. Previous comets have similarly passed through the solar system, providing valuable data for scientists studying celestial phenomena. The interest in such objects has spurred discussions among scientists and the public alike, particularly following the recent discovery of 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to track 3I/ATLAS as it moves through the solar system. The agency will provide updates on its trajectory and any new findings related to the comet.</p>
