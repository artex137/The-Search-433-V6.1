      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is approaching Earth</h2>

<p>Astronomy enthusiasts have a unique opportunity this December as Comet 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth, making its closest approach on 19 December 2025. The comet was first observed on 1 July 2025 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope in Chile. It will pass at approximately 1.8 astronomical units, or around 270 million kilometres, from Earth.</p>

<p>The passage of Comet 3I/ATLAS is significant as it is a rare interstellar visitor that offers a glimpse into material from outside our solar system. Authorities and astronomers are preparing for its arrival and encouraging the public to observe it using amateur telescopes, particularly during morning twilight in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS will make its closest approach to Earth on 19 December 2025.</li>
    <li>It was first observed on 1 July 2025 by the ATLAS telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>The comet is approximately 1.8 astronomical units (270 million kilometres) from Earth at its closest.</li>
    <li>Expected brightness is between magnitude 7 and 8, just below naked-eye visibility.</li>
    <li>It is the third confirmed interstellar object to pass through our solar system.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 1 July 2025, Comet 3I/ATLAS was first observed by the ATLAS telescope in Chile. Since then, astronomers have monitored its trajectory and characteristics, noting its unusual hyperbolic path, which means it is not gravitationally bound to the Sun. The comet is set to make its closest approach to Earth on 19 December 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Comet 3I/ATLAS provides a rare chance to observe material from another star system,” said an astronomer from the ATLAS team. “Its unique trajectory allows us to study how objects form in different environments.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS follows the passage of two previous interstellar objects, ‘Oumuamua in 2017 and Comet Borisov in 2019. Each of these objects has contributed to our understanding of the formation of planetary systems and the chemical composition of the universe.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the comet approaches, astronomers will continue to study its trajectory and composition. Observers are advised to plan viewing times around local sunset or morning twilight to maximize visibility. Long-exposure photography techniques will help capture details of the comet's tail.</p>
