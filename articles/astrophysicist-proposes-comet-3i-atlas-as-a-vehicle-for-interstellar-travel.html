      <h2>Astrophysicist Proposes Comet 3I/ATLAS as a Vehicle for Interstellar Travel</h2>

<p>Astrophysicist <strong>Avi Loeb</strong> has proposed using the interstellar comet <strong>3I/ATLAS</strong> as a means of transport for interstellar voyages. Loeb presented this concept recently, highlighting the comet's unique characteristics and its significance for future research in interstellar exploration.</p>

<p>This proposal could reshape how humanity approaches space travel. According to Loeb, 3I/ATLAS is the largest and fastest interstellar visitor observed, measuring over 1 km in size and traveling at a speed of 60 km/s. The comet's upcoming close approach to Jupiter on March 16, 2026, presents a significant opportunity for scientists to gather data and explore the comet's potential for interstellar transport.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS measures over 1 km in size.</li>
    <li>Travels at a remarkable speed of 60 km/s.</li>
    <li>Estimated to reach stars in the Milky Way's central ring in less than 1 billion years.</li>
    <li>Close approach to Jupiter expected on March 16, 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In recent discussions, Avi Loeb has introduced the concept of utilizing comets for interstellar travel. He emphasizes the unique properties of 3I/ATLAS, which could play a crucial role in future exploration. The comet's approach to Jupiter in 2026 is anticipated to provide valuable observational data for scientists.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The explored possibilities for using comets in space travel underscore the importance of investigating interstellar space and the potential of novel technologies,” said Loeb. “Such initiatives could fundamentally reshape approaches to space exploration and lower the costs of interstellar missions.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The idea of using natural celestial bodies for space travel is not new but has gained traction as technology advances. Previous studies have explored the potential of extracting resources from comets, which could significantly reduce mission costs. The ongoing research into 3I/ATLAS highlights a growing interest in interstellar exploration.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to study 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Jupiter. The close encounter in 2026 will likely yield data that could inform future missions and the feasibility of using comets as vehicles for interstellar travel.</p>
