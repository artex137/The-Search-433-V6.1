      <h2>Explosive UFO Documentary Highlights Secret US Project</h2>

<p>The new documentary titled <em>The Age of Disclosure</em> has premiered on Amazon Prime, featuring interviews with nearly 35 high-profile Americans discussing a secret US government project known as the “legacy program,” aimed at reverse-engineering alien technology. The film, directed by Dan Farah, includes contributions from notable figures such as Secretary of State Marco Rubio and former Department of Defense officials.</p>

<p>This documentary raises significant questions about the US government's transparency regarding extraterrestrial life and advanced technologies. It critiques the alleged eight-decade-long effort to retrieve and reverse-engineer materials from crashed alien craft, claiming that vital information has been kept hidden from the public.</p>
