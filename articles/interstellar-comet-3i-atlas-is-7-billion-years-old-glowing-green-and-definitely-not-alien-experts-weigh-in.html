      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Is 7 Billion Years Old, Glowing Green, and Definitely Not Alien – Experts Weigh In</h2>

<p>Astronomers have confirmed that interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, detected on 1 July 2025, is racing through the Solar System on a one-way path. The comet, first spotted by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS), has sparked speculation regarding its origins, but scientists have dismissed theories of it being alien technology.</p>

<p>The significance of 3I/ATLAS lies in its status as only the third confirmed interstellar object observed in our Solar System. Researchers estimate the comet is between seven and eight billion years old, predating Earth. This makes it a remarkable scientific discovery, providing insights into material from a distant star system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet detected on 1 July 2025 by ATLAS.</li>
    <li>Estimated age: 7 to 8 billion years.</li>
    <li>Only the third confirmed interstellar object observed.</li>
    <li>Recent images show a greenish glow due to gases reacting to solar heat.</li>
    <li>Comet is expected to continue moving away from the Sun.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 1 July 2025, astronomers detected the object now known as 3I/ATLAS. Initial observations indicated its unusual trajectory, confirming it was not bound to the Sun. As further observations progressed, scientists noted classic comet behaviour, including a visible coma and gas emissions. The comet's age and origin have been subjects of discussion among astrophysicists, with many refuting claims of alien technology.</p>

<p>Recent images from the Gemini North telescope in Hawai'i revealed a change in the comet's appearance, showing a faint greenish glow attributed to solar heating. This discovery has led to renewed interest in the comet's composition and behaviour as it moves away from the Sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS is a fascinating thing that current estimates say is maybe 7, 8 billion years old, has come from a distant star system older than our Solar System. An unprecedented opportunity to observe material that's coming from a distant star system,” said physicist Brian Cox.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“If it were artificial, it would be an oddly designed spacecraft, one that spends almost no time near Earth before heading straight back into interstellar space,” added Neil deGrasse Tyson.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The renewed attention towards 3I/ATLAS has largely stemmed from unfounded claims regarding its possible extraterrestrial origins. Notable figures, including Harvard professor Avi Loeb, have suggested the comet may be an alien technology due to certain features. However, experts emphasize the importance of focusing on the scientific implications of observing such an ancient object.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists plan to continue monitoring 3I/ATLAS as it moves away from the Sun to track any changes in its composition or activity. They aim to further understand how the comet behaves as it cools and returns to interstellar space.</p>
