      <h2>3I/ATLAS exhibits a 14th anomaly in its jet-Sun geometry – Details explored</h2>

<p>Harvard physicist Avi Loeb has reported a 14th anomaly related to the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, specifically concerning the geometry of its anti-tail jet in relation to the sun. This finding emerged from a new paper detailing observations made during the July to August 2025 phase.</p>

<p>This anomaly is significant as it suggests unusual behavior in the jet of 3I/ATLAS. Loeb's findings indicate that the jet wobbles in a regular pattern, maintaining a close alignment to the object's spin axis. Authorities and scientists are now examining the implications of this anomaly for understanding the nature of 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovery made by Harvard physicist <strong>Avi Loeb</strong>.</li>
    <li>The anomaly relates to the anti-tail jet of <strong>3I/ATLAS</strong>.</li>
    <li>Observations occurred during the <strong>July to August 2025</strong> phase.</li>
    <li>Jet base offset by less than <strong>8 degrees</strong> from the spin axis.</li>
    <li>Probability of such an alignment occurring by chance is <strong>0.005</strong>.</li>
    <li>Further anomaly probability calculated at <strong>0.000025</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, scientists observed a regular wobble in the anti-tail of 3I/ATLAS, prompting an analysis of its geometric behavior. By August 2025, Loeb published his findings, noting that the jet's alignment with the spin axis was unusual, particularly during perihelion when the object passed closest to the sun.</p>

<p>Loeb explained that during this phase, one side of 3I/ATLAS consistently faces the sun, creating a "steady dayside" and "steady nightside." Observations after perihelion revealed a continued sunward anti-tail, despite the sun illuminating the nightside, which is typically inactive.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The new anomaly relates to the small probability of the rotation axis of the nucleus of 3I/ATLAS being aligned to within 8 degrees with the direction of the sun,” Loeb said. “The chance of two major pockets of ice being located near the rotation poles of 3I/ATLAS… is the square of 0.005 or a tiny probability of merely 0.000025.”
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to this finding, 3I/ATLAS had displayed several unusual behaviors that have puzzled scientists. The study of its anomalies contributes to ongoing research into the characteristics of interstellar objects and their origins.</p>

<p>The implications of Loeb's findings challenge the classification of 3I/ATLAS as a natural comet, raising questions about its composition and behavior as it approaches and moves away from the sun.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to investigate the characteristics of 3I/ATLAS and the implications of this 14th anomaly. Further observations and analyses are expected to provide additional insights into the nature of the interstellar object.</p>
