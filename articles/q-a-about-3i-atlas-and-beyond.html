      <h2>Q&A About 3I/ATLAS and Beyond</h2>

<p>Professor Avi Loeb has discussed the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS in a recent Q&A session, highlighting its unusual features and scientific significance. The object has reemerged from behind the Sun, revealing a complex structure of jets that differ from typical comets. The discussion took place in a written format with journalist Ivan Petričević, but no specific date or location for the Q&A has been disclosed.</p>

<p>The significance of 3I/ATLAS lies in its potential to challenge existing theories about interstellar objects. Loeb has raised questions about why NASA has not released detailed observations of the comet, particularly during its upcoming close approach to Mars on October 3, 2025. He attributes the delay to bureaucratic issues related to the U.S. Government shutdown, which has hindered NASA's ability to communicate information about the comet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Close approach to Mars:</strong> October 3, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Mars at closest approach:</strong> 29 million kilometers</li>
    <li><strong>Jet structure:</strong> Extends up to 1 million kilometers towards the Sun and 3 million kilometers away</li>
    <li><strong>NASA image release status:</strong> Delayed due to U.S. Government shutdown</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has gained attention due to its unique characteristics observed since its emergence from behind the Sun. In the coming weeks, scientists plan to conduct spectroscopic measurements to analyze the jets' velocity and composition.</p>

<p>Loeb has pointed out that the jets could either be a result of sunlight heating pockets of ice or possibly from thrusters on a spacecraft. The distinction between these two possibilities will rely on the analysis of the jets' Doppler velocity.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Science should not be held hostage by bureaucracy,” said Loeb in reference to NASA's delay in releasing images of 3I/ATLAS.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Critics are trained on data sets of past knowledge... This simply underscores their limited vocabulary,” Loeb stated, addressing skepticism towards his unconventional theories.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is part of a growing list of interstellar objects detected in recent years, including 1I/‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Loeb emphasizes the need for enhanced observational capabilities to discover more such objects, as current telescopes may miss smaller or faster-moving interstellar visitors.</p>

<p>The NSF-DOE Rubin Observatory is expected to aid in locating new interstellar objects in the next decade, potentially transforming our understanding of cosmic bodies entering our Solar System.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>In the coming weeks, scientists will conduct further observations of 3I/ATLAS to determine the nature of its jets. The analysis will focus on distinguishing between natural and artificial origins of the jets, while discussions about NASA's communication practices continue within the scientific community.</p>
