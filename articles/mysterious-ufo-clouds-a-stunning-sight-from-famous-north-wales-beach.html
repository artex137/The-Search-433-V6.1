      <h2>Mysterious 'UFO clouds' a stunning sight from famous North Wales beach</h2>

<p>Otherworldly clouds have appeared above the North Wales mountains, glowing eerily in the low sun this week. Walkers in Eryri (Snowdonia) and the Llŷn Peninsula have reported the strange beauty of the clouds, which have historically been likened to flying saucers and have been associated with several UFO sightings.</p>

<p>The appearance of these rare lenticular clouds has drawn considerable attention, prompting local authorities to remind visitors to maintain safety while enjoying the natural spectacle. The phenomenon has caused long queues for beachgoers at Newborough beach, also known as Traeth Llanddwyn, as many have flocked to witness the unusual formations.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Location: Eryri (Snowdonia) and Llŷn Peninsula, North Wales</li>
    <li>Cloud formations: Lenticular clouds, also known as pancake clouds</li>
    <li>Frequency: Rare in the UK, depend on specific weather conditions</li>
    <li>Duration: Clouds appeared briefly, lasting as little as 10 minutes</li>
    <li>Impact: Long queues reported at Newborough beach during the festive period</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>This week, unique clouds have formed above the North Wales mountains, with sightings reported by walkers in both Eryri and the Llŷn Peninsula. The clouds have appeared twice, notably over Anglesey’s southwest coast, captivating visitors and prompting them to share photos online.</p>

<p>The Met Office has explained the formation process of lenticular clouds, noting that they require specific weather patterns and hilly terrain, making Eryri an ideal location for their occurrence. The clouds are formed when wind blows across hills at different heights, creating standing waves that condense moisture in the air.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“When air blows across a mountain range, in certain circumstances, it can set up a train of large standing waves in the air downstream,” the Met Office said. “If there is enough moisture in the air, the rising motion of the wave will cause water vapour to condense, forming the unique appearance of lenticular clouds.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Lenticular clouds are not commonly seen in the UK, as they require a combination of specific atmospheric conditions and geographical features. The recent high-pressure systems in the area have contributed to the formation of these clouds, alongside a series of spectacular cloud inversions in the national park.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities continue to monitor visitor safety as people flock to view the clouds. The Met Office will likely provide updates on weather patterns that may influence further sightings in the region.</p>
