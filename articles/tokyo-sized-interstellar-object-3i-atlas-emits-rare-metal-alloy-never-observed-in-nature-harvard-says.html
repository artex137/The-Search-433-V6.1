      <h2>Tokyo-Sized Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS Emits Rare Metal Alloy—‘Never Observed in Nature,’ Harvard Says</h2>

<p>A mysterious interstellar object known as 3I/ATLAS has been observed emitting a metal compound that has never before been seen in nature. The object, which passed within 12 million miles of Mars from October 4 to 7, is currently being studied by astronomers who are puzzled by its unusual chemical signature.</p>

<p>The detection of nickel tetracarbonyl (Ni(CO)₄), a toxic and volatile organometallic gas, raises questions about the object’s origins and composition. According to a peer-reviewed preprint study by W.B. Hoogendam et al., the object is emitting approximately four grams of nickel per second, with no trace of iron, contradicting established cometary norms. Researchers are now examining the implications of these findings for our understanding of interstellar debris.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Observation Period: October 4-7, 2025</li>
    <li>Closest Approach: 12 million miles from Mars</li>
    <li>Emission Rate: Approximately four grams of nickel per second</li>
    <li>Discovered By: A team using the Keck II telescope in Hawaii</li>
    <li>Key Finding: Emission of nickel tetracarbonyl (Ni(CO)₄) without iron</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected earlier this year as it entered the Solar System. Initial observations suggested it was a typical comet, similar to previous interstellar objects like ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov. However, subsequent data revealed its unusual composition and behavior.</p>

<p>From October 4 to 7, 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to Mars, allowing for intense observation by NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and other telescopes. The data collected has provided insights into the object's chemical emissions.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Why are we seeing a jet pointed at the Sun? This was never observed for any other object,” said Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb, commenting on the unusual behavior of 3I/ATLAS.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The detection of nickel tetracarbonyl is unprecedented in the study of comets. Prior research has shown that nickel and iron typically occur together in cometary atmospheres, as documented in a 2021 study published in Nature. The absence of iron in 3I/ATLAS challenges existing models of cometary chemistry.</p>

<p>Similar to 3I/ATLAS, ʻOumuamua generated significant debate regarding its origins. While some researchers have suggested it may have been artificially constructed, the majority of scientists lean towards natural explanations, albeit with a need for further investigation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze the data collected from 3I/ATLAS. The implications of its chemical emissions could influence various fields, including astrochemistry and planet formation. Further studies are expected as scientists work to understand this unique interstellar object.</p>
