      <h2>Barack Obama says aliens are 'real', but rules out Area 51 conspiracy</h2>

<p>Former US president Barack Obama has stated that he believes in the existence of aliens but does not know where such life might be, during a podcast interview released on Saturday. Obama emphasized, “They’re real,” when asked about extraterrestrial life, but added, “I haven’t seen them. They’re not being kept at Area 51.”</p>

<p>This statement is significant as it reflects a growing interest in unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs), particularly after the release of government documents detailing unexplained aircraft sightings. Authorities are continuing to investigate these sightings, which have garnered public attention and speculation about extraterrestrial contact.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Barack Obama made the statements during a podcast with YouTuber Brian Tyler Cowen.</li>
    <li>He stated that he has not seen aliens and ruled out the existence of underground facilities at Area 51.</li>
    <li>Area 51 is located in Groom Lake, Nevada, and is a US Air Force base.</li>
    <li>Interest in UAPs has increased following the release of government documents on unexplained aircraft sightings.</li>
    <li>Obama previously discussed UFOs in a 2021 interview with James Corden.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On Saturday, Obama addressed the existence of aliens in a podcast interview. He confirmed his belief in extraterrestrial life but dismissed the idea that aliens are being kept at Area 51. This aligns with his earlier comments made in 2021, where he acknowledged the reality of UAPs and the government’s inability to explain their origins.</p>

<p>In 2021, Obama appeared on "The Late Late Show," where he hinted at undisclosed information regarding aliens. His recent comments are part of an ongoing dialogue about UAPs, which have become a focus of media and public interest.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“They’re real... But I haven’t seen them. They’re not being kept at Area 51,” Obama said during the interview.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“But what is true — and I’m actually being serious here — is that there’s footage and records of objects in the skies that we don’t know exactly what they are,” he added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Obama's comments come amid increased scrutiny of UAPs, particularly after the release of radar recordings from US Air Force Reaper drones, which reportedly show UAPs operating over the Middle East. These incidents have contributed to a culture of speculation regarding government knowledge of extraterrestrial life.</p>

<p>The term UAP has replaced UFO in official contexts, reflecting a shift in how the government addresses unidentified phenomena. The interest in UAPs has led to calls for more transparency and investigation into these sightings.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities are expected to continue investigating UAP sightings and may release more information as it becomes available. The ongoing interest in extraterrestrial life and its implications for national security and public curiosity will likely remain a topic of discussion in the coming months.</p>
