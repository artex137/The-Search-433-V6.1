      <h2>Is it a UFO or a drug cartel drone? A mysterious new metal sphere is silently hovering over the Cauca Valley in Colombia</h2>

<p>A reflective, perfectly round object has been spotted drifting silently over mountainous terrain in Valle del Cauca, Colombia, as recently as January 2026. Witnesses have reported that the sphere moves without any visible engine noise, rotors, or signs of propulsion. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with the sighting.</p>

<p>This sighting has garnered significant attention as it follows a similar incident in March 2025, when a metallic sphere was recovered in the municipality of Buga. The recovered object was handed to researcher Jaime Maussan for analysis, who claimed it exhibited properties inconsistent with known human technology. Authorities have yet to issue an official statement regarding the latest sightings.</p>
