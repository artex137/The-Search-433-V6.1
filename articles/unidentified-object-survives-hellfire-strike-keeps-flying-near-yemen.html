      <h2>Unidentified object survives Hellfire strike, keeps flying near Yemen</h2>

<p>On September 9, 2025, the U.S. Congress released footage of an unidentified anomalous phenomenon (UAP) that continued to fly after being struck by a Hellfire missile from an MQ-9 Reaper drone near the Yemeni coast. The video, captured on October 30, 2024, shows the UAP shedding debris but remaining airborne following the missile strike. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This incident raises questions about the nature of the object and whether it poses a threat to U.S. naval operations in the region. U.S. authorities have not disclosed additional details regarding the object’s identity or intentions. Representative Eric BurliSon, who revealed the video, has stated he will not speculate on the footage.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of video release: September 9, 2025</li>
    <li>Date of incident: October 30, 2024</li>
    <li>Location: Near the Yemeni coast</li>
    <li>Type of drone: MQ-9 Reaper</li>
    <li>Type of missile: Hellfire missile</li>
    <li>Video source: U.S. Congress</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 30, 2024, an MQ-9 Reaper drone tracked a fast-moving object off the coast of Yemen. The drone was given the green light to engage, and a Hellfire missile was launched. The object was observed shedding debris but continued flying despite being struck.</p>

<p>On September 9, 2025, Representative Eric BurliSon disclosed the footage during a House Government Oversight subcommittee hearing. He received a tip regarding the video, which was made public for the first time.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I will not explain or speculate about the footage.” — Rep. Eric BurliSon</blockquote>
<blockquote>“A Hellfire missile struck this UFO, appeared to bounce off, and the object continued. What is this thing?” — George Knapp, UAP investigative journalist</blockquote>
<blockquote>“We have nothing to say.” — Pentagon spokesperson</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to this incident, the U.S. Navy had been active in protecting commercial shipping routes near Yemen and intercepting missiles and drones launched by Houthi rebels. The U.S. had deployed MQ-9 drones primarily for operations targeting Houthi strongholds. The Houthis have claimed to have shot down dozens of these drones, including a video release in April 2024 showing the interception of an MQ-9.</p>

<p>The U.S. Department of Defense established the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) in 2022 to investigate UAPs across various domains. Previous investigations have concluded that some UAPs were misidentified, such as a high-speed object filmed in 2015 that was later determined to be a weather balloon.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the object and the circumstances surrounding the missile strike are ongoing. Further analysis of the video footage may provide additional insights, but no specific timeline has been disclosed for any forthcoming findings or statements from the Pentagon.</p>
