      <h2>What we know so far about 3I/ATLAS: Everything understood to date</h2>

<p>3I/ATLAS, the interstellar object, has captured the attention of researchers and space enthusiasts since its discovery on July 1, 2025, when it was first spotted by the ATLAS (Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System) survey telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this object.</p>

<p>The object is significant as it is the third observed interstellar object, and its anomalous characteristics have sparked debates within the scientific community. NASA continues to monitor 3I/ATLAS, assuring the public that it poses no threat to Earth, as it will remain hundreds of millions of kilometers away during its closest approach.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered on July 1, 2025, from Rio Hurtado, Chile.</li>
    <li>Initial distance from Earth at discovery: approximately 420 million miles.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth is on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>Speed at discovery: approximately 137,000 miles per hour; increased to 153,000 mph near the sun.</li>
    <li>Nucleus diameter estimated between 440 meters and 5,600 meters.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected by the ATLAS telescope on July 1, 2025. Observations have since revealed that it shows unique characteristics that challenge the typical classification of comets. Initial reports from June 14, 2025, have surfaced, indicating earlier observations from various ATLAS telescopes and the Zwicky Transient Facility.</p>

<p>In November and early December 2025, NASA released new images of 3I/ATLAS, revealing its light pulsating in jets resembling a heartbeat, with a period of 16.16 hours. This observation has led to speculation about its nature, with astrophysicist Avi Loeb suggesting the possibility of an artificial propulsion system, although this remains unverified.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Since its first report, observations from before the discovery have been gathered from the archives of three different ATLAS telescopes around the world and the Zwicky Transient Facility at the Palomar Observatory in San Diego County, California,” NASA's official website stated.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The interstellar object poses no threat to human life as it will remain hundreds of millions of kilometers away from Earth even during its closest approach,” NASA assured.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS marks it as the third interstellar object identified, following 1I/2017 U1 and 2I/Borisov. Its peculiar features, such as an abundance of nickel and unusual brightening, have led to ongoing discussions about its origins, with no definitive conclusions drawn yet regarding its nature—whether natural or artificial.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches its closest point to Earth on December 19, 2025, NASA and other space agencies will continue to monitor its trajectory and characteristics, providing further updates as new information becomes available.</p>
