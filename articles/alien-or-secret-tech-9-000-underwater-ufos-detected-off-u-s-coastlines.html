      <h2>Alien or Secret Tech? 9,000 'Underwater UFOs' Detected Off U.S. Coastlines</h2>

<p>A surge in reports of Unidentified Submersible Objects (USOs) off U.S. coastlines has raised concerns among defense officials. The tracking app Enigma has recorded over 9,000 sightings of these mysterious underwater anomalies since its launch in late 2022. These reports include descriptions of glowing objects rising from the depths and disappearing into the water without a trace.</p>

<p>The significance of these findings has prompted authorities to consider potential implications for national security. Retired U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Tim Gallaudet has emphasized that the presence of unexplained objects in U.S. waters should not be overlooked, suggesting that the government may be withholding information about these phenomena.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Enigma has recorded over 30,000 unexplained events since late 2022.</li>
    <li>More than 9,000 USO sightings have occurred within 10 miles of U.S. shorelines.</li>
    <li>California leads with 389 USO reports, followed by Florida with 306.</li>
    <li>More than 150 reports describe objects hovering just above or plunging into the water.</li>
    <li>Notable incidents include a 2019 sighting by the USS Omaha of a spherical object entering the ocean.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Since the launch of Enigma in late 2022, the app has logged a dramatic rise in USO sightings. Reports have surged, particularly in coastal areas, drawing attention from both the public and military officials.</p>
<p>In 2019, the USS Omaha tracked a spherical object that flew over the Pacific Ocean before plunging into the water. Pentagon officials later verified the footage, noting the object left no wake or debris.</p>
<p>In 2024, Gallaudet testified before the U.S. House Oversight Committee, reiterating the seriousness of these sightings and urging further investigation into the implications for national security.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The fact that unidentified objects with unexplainable characteristics are entering U.S. water space and the Department of Defense is not raising a giant red flag is a sign that the government is not sharing all it knows,” said Gallaudet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“We know more about the surface of Mars than our own deep sea,” he added, emphasizing the need for further exploration of these phenomena.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>USOs, the underwater counterparts to UFOs, have been reported throughout history. Accounts date back centuries, with witnesses describing objects that move at extraordinary speeds and change direction abruptly. The recent data from Enigma has reignited interest in these phenomena, particularly near naval training zones and busy shipping routes.</p>
<p>Experts have suggested that while some sightings may be attributed to advanced military technology, the reported speeds and maneuvers often exceed current human capabilities, warranting deeper investigation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities are expected to continue investigating these USO sightings to determine their source and implications for national security. Calls for transparency from the government regarding these phenomena have intensified, as the need for understanding the underwater domain grows.</p>
