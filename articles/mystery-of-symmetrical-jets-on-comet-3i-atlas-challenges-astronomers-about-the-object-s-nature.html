      <h2>Mystery of symmetrical jets on comet 3I/ATLAS challenges astronomers about the object’s nature</h2>

<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has intrigued astronomers as it moves away from the solar system following its closest approach to Earth in December 2024. Observations from the Hubble Space Telescope have revealed three symmetrical jets emerging from the comet at equal angles, raising questions about the object's nature.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant for the scientific community, which has focused on understanding interstellar objects since the discovery of 3I/ATLAS in July 2024. The findings support the theory that 3I/ATLAS is a natural comet, primarily composed of water ice and carbon dioxide, originating from a distant star system. The unique characteristics of the comet, particularly its “antitail” pointing towards the Sun, indicate substantial surface mass loss due to heating during its closest approach.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 2024</li>
    <li>Observations made by: Hubble Space Telescope</li>
    <li>Number of jets observed: Three symmetrical jets</li>
    <li>Discovery of 3I/ATLAS: July 2024</li>
    <li>Antitail characteristic: Points towards the Sun</li>
    <li>Research teams involved: Harvard University, Breakthrough Listen project</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2024, capturing the attention of astronomers. By December 2024, Hubble Space Telescope images revealed the presence of three symmetrical jets, alongside the known antitail. This observation prompted renewed discussions about the nature of the object.</p>

<p>The Breakthrough Listen project reported that the Green Bank radio telescope did not detect any artificial signals from 3I/ATLAS during its closest approach, adding to the evidence supporting its classification as a natural comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb, an astronomer from Harvard, expressed his bewilderment at the observed symmetry of the jets and the alignment with the antitail, questioning how they could be perfectly aligned around a much larger feature.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Other researchers, including NASA experts, refute the idea that 3I/ATLAS is a technological remnant, pointing to data suggesting its similarity to known comets in our solar system.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is one of only three confirmed interstellar objects, following ‘Oumuamua, which sparked similar speculation regarding artificial origins. The current findings about 3I/ATLAS emphasize its typical comet features, including a coma and a non-elongated nucleus, contrasting with earlier hypotheses about interstellar probes.</p>

<p>Despite the prevailing view that 3I/ATLAS is a natural celestial body, its rarity justifies ongoing investigations into its composition and behavior, contributing to a broader understanding of planetary system formation and evolution beyond our own.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it remains within the solar system for several months. However, observations will become increasingly challenging as the distance from Earth grows. Data collection in the coming months will be critical to consolidating the understanding of the comet’s composition and the phenomena observed.</p>
