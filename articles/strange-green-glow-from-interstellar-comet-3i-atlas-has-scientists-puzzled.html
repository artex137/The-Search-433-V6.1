      <h2>Strange Green Glow From Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Has Scientists Puzzled</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has shown a peculiar green glow during its approach to the Solar System, as captured in images taken during a total lunar eclipse on September 7, 2025. The comet's unusual coloration has raised questions among scientists, particularly since observations have revealed few signs of the dicarbon (C<sub>2</sub>) molecules typically responsible for such a glow.</p>

<p>This phenomenon matters because it suggests that the chemical composition of 3I/ATLAS may hold undiscovered secrets. Researchers are currently analyzing the comet's emissions to understand better the reasons behind its green appearance. The comet is expected to make its closest pass to Earth in December, providing further opportunities for study.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS displayed a blue-green gas coma measuring 2.5 arcminutes across.</li>
    <li>The images were taken by astrophotographers Gerald Rhemann and Michael Jäger in Namibia.</li>
    <li>Observations revealed the presence of larger than usual proportions of carbon dioxide, nickel, and cyanogen in the comet.</li>
    <li>The comet is expected to pass closest to Earth in December 2025.</li>
    <li>A study led by astronomer Luis Salazar Manzano indicates a strong depletion of carbon-chain molecules in 3I/ATLAS.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On September 7, 2025, during the total lunar eclipse, images of comet 3I/ATLAS were captured, revealing a green glow. Further observations on September 9 showed a short tail accompanying the comet, photographed with a 12"/f-3.6 astrograph in Namibia. Researchers have since analyzed the comet's chemical composition, highlighting the absence of expected dicarbon molecules.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Our upper limit on the C<sub>2</sub>-to-CN ratio places 3I/ATLAS among the most carbon-chain depleted comets known,” said astronomer Luis Salazar Manzano from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The peculiar chemical composition of 3I/ATLAS is not unprecedented, but it adds to the growing body of research on interstellar comets. Previous studies have highlighted the diversity in chemical make-up among comets, but 3I/ATLAS's significant depletion of carbon-chain molecules presents a unique challenge for scientists.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists plan to gather more data on 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth in December 2025, aiming to uncover the mysteries behind its unusual green glow and unique chemical composition.</p>
