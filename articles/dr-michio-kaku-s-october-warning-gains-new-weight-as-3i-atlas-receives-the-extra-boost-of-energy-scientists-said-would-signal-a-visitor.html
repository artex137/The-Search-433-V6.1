      <h2>Dr. Michio Kaku’s October Warning Gains New Weight as 3I/ATLAS Receives the “Extra Boost of Energy” Scientists Said Would Signal a Visitor</h2>

<p>On November 28, scientists confirmed that Comet 3I/ATLAS received an extra boost of energy on October 30, aligning with a prediction made by physicist Dr. Michio Kaku. His warning, delivered in October, stated that if the comet accelerated beyond gravitational explanations, it could indicate an intelligent visitor. The data, published by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, has raised questions in the scientific community regarding the implications of this acceleration.</p>

<p>This development is significant as it challenges existing models of comet behavior and raises concerns among researchers about the nature of 3I/ATLAS. Authorities, including NASA and the European Space Agency, have maintained a conservative approach in discussing the object, emphasizing the need for further observation and analysis.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Dr. Michio Kaku issued his warning on October 30, 2025.</li>
    <li>The A1 radial coefficient registered at 1.6 × 10⁻⁶ au/day² on October 30.</li>
    <li>By November 24, the coefficient was updated to 4 × 10⁻⁷ au/day².</li>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS has exhibited anomalous behaviors not seen in other comets.</li>
    <li>Public demand for transparency regarding the comet's nature is increasing.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 30, 2025, Dr. Michio Kaku warned the world to monitor 3I/ATLAS for signs of an energy boost. This prediction was based on the behavior of the comet, which he claimed could indicate an extraterrestrial visitor. Following this, on November 28, data confirmed that the comet had indeed experienced an unexpected acceleration.</p>
<p>NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory published the non-gravitational acceleration parameters on November 28, prompting renewed scrutiny of Kaku's claims and the comet's unusual characteristics.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“If this interstellar object accelerated beyond what gravity alone could explain, it means we are being visited,” Dr. Michio Kaku said in October.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The object is behaving in a way that the model does not yet understand,” said Dr. Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The behavior of 3I/ATLAS has been unprecedented, with reports of a structured, rotating envelope and spectral signatures that differ from typical comet compositions. This has led to a growing discussion in the scientific community about the limitations of current models in explaining such phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As scientists approach the critical observation window in December, they expect to capture the sharpest images yet of 3I/ATLAS. These observations may provide further insights into the comet's behavior and could potentially escalate the discussion regarding its origins and nature.</p>
