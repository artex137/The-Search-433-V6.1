      <h2>Giant ‘hidden in plain sight’ UFO is being guarded at secret mountain base</h2>

<p>A United States congressman has claimed that a large unidentified flying object (UFO) is being protected at a secret location in South Korea. On Monday, Rep Eric Burlison stated that the site is "guarded like it’s some kind of commodity" and mentioned that former President Donald Trump is aware of "alien-human hybrids" allegedly present on Earth.</p>

<p>This assertion has sparked interest and debate regarding the existence of extraterrestrial life. Authorities are now examining the claims, while a South Korean researcher has dismissed the allegations, asserting that the structure in question has been in existence since the 1970s and has no links to aliens.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Location: Mountain near Seoul, South Korea</li>
    <li>Diameter of the structure: Approximately 270 feet</li>
    <li>Congressman making the claim: Eric Burlison</li>
    <li>Date of claim: Monday</li>
    <li>Former President Barack Obama’s comments about aliens: Released in a podcast on Saturday</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On Monday, Rep Eric Burlison made claims regarding a UFO being guarded in South Korea. He noted that the object is not located in a facility widely reported in the media. On Saturday, former President Barack Obama discussed the reality of aliens in a podcast, stating, “They’re real, but I haven’t seen them.”</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "If I come under any hard evidence, whether it’s physical or video evidence that is absolutely definitive, I will not hold back on telling the American people that we are alone or not alone in this universe." 
    <strong>- Rep Eric Burlison</strong>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “They’re not being kept in Area 51, there’s no underground facility, unless there’s this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the president of the United States.” 
    <strong>- Barack Obama</strong>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “When it comes to aliens, there are some things I just can’t tell you on air.” 
    <strong>- Barack Obama</strong>
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous incidents involving UFO sightings have often led to speculation about government secrecy regarding extraterrestrial life. Area 51, a highly classified military base in Nevada, has been the subject of numerous conspiracy theories, although Obama has clarified its true nature as an air force facility.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the claims made by Rep Burlison are ongoing, as authorities seek to verify the details surrounding the alleged UFO and the facility's true purpose in South Korea.</p>
