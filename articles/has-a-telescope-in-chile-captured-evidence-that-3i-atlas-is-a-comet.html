      <h2>Has a telescope in Chile captured evidence that 3I/ATLAS is a comet?</h2>

<p>A telescope in Chile has likely captured evidence that 3I/ATLAS is a comet. The discovery was made by the Gemini South telescope at Cerro Pachón, with new images showing the interstellar object developing a visible tail and a dense coma. This finding may resolve ongoing debates among scientists regarding the nature of 3I/ATLAS since its discovery.</p>

<p>The significance of this discovery lies in the potential to clarify the classification of 3I/ATLAS, which has sparked considerable debate in the scientific community. The Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS) has provided clear evidence that supports the view of most scientists who believe 3I/ATLAS is indeed a comet, despite previous claims from some, including Harvard scientist Avi Loeb, who have questioned its classification.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovery made by Gemini South at Cerro Pachón, Chile.</li>
    <li>New images captured on August 27, 2025.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is moving at a speed of 60,000 km/second.</li>
    <li>Will fly by Mars on October 3, 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun (perihelion) on October 29, 2025.</li>
    <li>Nearest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of 269 million km.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025. Since its discovery, scientists have debated its classification due to the absence of a clear tail. On August 27, 2025, the Gemini South telescope captured images revealing a cometary tail and a broad coma, indicating that 3I/ATLAS is likely a comet.</p>

<p>During a public outreach initiative organized by NSF NOIRLab, students from Hawai‘i and La Serena, Chile, observed 3I/ATLAS in real time. The session aimed to photograph the interstellar object and gather data on its spectrum, which can provide insights into its composition.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb claimed that since there is no clear tail, 3I/ATLAS cannot be classified as a comet. However, the scientific community does not agree with Loeb. Almost all of them believe that 3I/ATLAS is a comet.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to this discovery, 3I/ATLAS had generated significant interest due to its unusual trajectory and behaviour. Some scientists speculated it might represent a new type of cosmic object. The recent images from GMOS may provide critical data that could enhance understanding of such interstellar visitors.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to study 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth, gathering more data to confirm its classification and explore its composition. The upcoming flyby of Mars and perihelion will be key opportunities for further observations.</p>
