      <h2>3I Atlas: Scientist says Interstellar Object did not change color, decodes mystery behind Blue-Green claim</h2>

<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, which has gained attention for claims of changing colors during its close approach to the Sun, has not actually undergone any color transformation, according to a report by NASA-linked scientists. The clarification follows various media reports suggesting the comet shifted from red to blue-green hues as it neared the Sun on October 30, 2023.</p>

<p>This clarification matters because it addresses the misconceptions surrounding the comet's appearance, which have sparked significant public interest in 3I/ATLAS. Scientists are now focusing on understanding its true characteristics and implications for studying interstellar objects, which are rare visitors to our solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object in the solar system, discovered in July 2025.</li>
    <li>It made its closest approach to the Sun on October 30, 2023.</li>
    <li>Three solar observatories captured images of the comet during its passage.</li>
    <li>Qicheng Zhang, a postdoctoral fellow at the Lowell Observatory, co-authored a study clarifying the color claims.</li>
    <li>The comet's blue-green hue is attributed to gases like diatomic carbon and cyanogen.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025. It approached the Sun on October 30, 2023, prompting extensive monitoring by astronomers worldwide. During this period, significant brightening was observed, leading to speculation about color changes.</p>
<p>On October 30, images captured by three solar observatories showed the comet with a bright, blue-green appearance. However, Qicheng Zhang later clarified that the color claims were misleading and that the observed tint is due to the comet's gas coma.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We don’t have any evidence for the gas coma changing colors,” said Qicheng Zhang. “Our result just showed that the gas coma is likely still around and contributing substantially to the overall brightness.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“As far as we know, the comet just ‘changed color’ once when its gas coma first became visible or bright, and it’s still like that now — only brighter,” Zhang added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is significant as it offers scientists a rare opportunity to study materials formed around another star. Previous interstellar objects, such as ‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019, have also drawn global attention for their unique characteristics and origins.</p>
<p>The study of these objects can provide insights into the building blocks of exoplanetary systems and the dynamics of materials traveling through interstellar space.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to observe 3I/ATLAS as it travels through the solar system, aiming to gather more data on its composition and behavior. Further studies are expected to enhance understanding of interstellar materials and their implications for cosmic research.</p>
