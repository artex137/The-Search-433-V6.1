      <h2>See the Interstellar Comet Passing by Earth Tonight</h2>

<p>On December 19, 2025, the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS will make its closest approach to Earth at 1 a.m. EST (6 a.m. GMT), providing a unique opportunity for astronomers and space enthusiasts to observe this celestial event.</p>

<p>This close encounter of 3I/ATLAS is significant as it allows for a rare glimpse into material from beyond our solar system. Observatories and amateur astronomers are preparing to observe the comet, which will remain visible for several months following its closest approach.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Origin:</strong> First identified by ATLAS in Chile through images taken in June 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Diameter:</strong> Estimated between 1,000 feet (320 meters) and 3.5 miles (5.6 kilometers)</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Approximately 130,000 miles per hour (209,000 kilometers per hour)</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach:</strong> 168 million miles (270 million kilometers) from Earth</li>
    <li><strong>Visibility:</strong> Not visible to the naked eye or with basic binoculars; best observed with telescopes</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The comet 3I/ATLAS was first identified on July 1, 2025, through images captured by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Chile. It has been traveling through space, and on December 19, 2025, it will reach its closest point to Earth at 1 a.m. EST (6 a.m. GMT).</p>
<p>After this date, the comet will continue to be visible for several months, gradually fading over time as it moves away from Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Mark your calendars for tonight, as the closest look at the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS presents an exciting chance to learn about material from beyond our solar system and gain insights into planetary formation,” said a representative from the observing community.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is part of a larger trend of increased interest in interstellar objects, following the discovery of other celestial bodies originating outside our solar system. Observing such comets provides valuable data for scientists studying planetary formation and the evolution of our cosmic neighborhood.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>After its closest approach, astronomers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it remains visible for several months, providing ongoing opportunities for study and observation.</p>
