      <h2>Other Comet ATLAS Now a Cloud of Debris Nearing Earth on 25 November</h2>

<p>Comet ATLAS, once anticipated as a spectacular celestial event, has disintegrated into a vast cloud of debris and is approaching Earth, with its closest pass scheduled for 25 November. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>The disintegration of Comet ATLAS is significant as it highlights the dynamic nature of celestial objects and their behavior near the Sun. Authorities, including astronomers from the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS), are monitoring the remnants and providing updates on its trajectory and visibility.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet ATLAS is now a cloud of debris, having disintegrated into multiple fragments.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth is scheduled for 25 November, at a distance of approximately 37 million miles (60 million km).</li>
    <li>The comet passed its perihelion on 8 October, coming within 31 million miles (50 million km) of the Sun.</li>
    <li>Initial discovery of the object occurred in May 2025 by the ATLAS telescope network.</li>
    <li>The cloud is currently visible in the constellation Leo, at a magnitude of 9.9.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet ATLAS, designated C/2025 K1, was discovered in May 2025 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System. It passed its closest point to the Sun on 8 October 2025. Recent observations indicated that the comet has broken apart into a cloud of debris due to the Sun's gravitational forces. The closest approach to Earth is set for 25 November 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Several parts (sub-nuclei or clouds of debris) are visible, also a plume just below the leading fragment,” said Gianluca Masi, an astronomer based in Manciano, Italy.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The disintegration of Comet ATLAS serves as a reminder of the unpredictable nature of comets as they approach the Sun. Previous comets have also experienced fragmentation, but this event underscores the importance of monitoring such objects for scientific understanding and public awareness.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As Comet ATLAS approaches Earth, astronomers will continue to track its remnants and provide updates on visibility and potential observations for sky-watchers.</p>
