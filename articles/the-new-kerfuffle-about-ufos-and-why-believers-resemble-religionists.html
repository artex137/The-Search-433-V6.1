      <h2>The new kerfuffle about UFOs, and why believers resemble religionists</h2>

<p>A group of U.S. lawmakers has gathered on Capitol Hill to view a new documentary titled “The Age of Disclosure,” which features discussions about unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), commonly known as UFOs. The screening took place on Monday, following delays caused by a long government shutdown, and included a bipartisan mix of Republicans and Democrats.</p>

<p>This event highlights ongoing debates about UAP and government transparency. The documentary claims to present insights from nearly three dozen current and former government officials who allege knowledge of advanced nonhuman intelligence and suggest an 80-year cover-up regarding the reverse engineering of technology from crashes. The Pentagon’s All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office has stated it has no verifiable information to support claims of a government program to reverse-engineer extraterrestrial materials.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event: Screening of “The Age of Disclosure”</li>
    <li>Date: Monday</li>
    <li>Location: Capitol Hill, Washington, D.C.</li>
    <li>Participants: Bipartisan group of lawmakers, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio</li>
    <li>Documentary features: 34 government officials discussing UAP</li>
    <li>Legislation: UAP Disclosure Act proposed by Senators Chuck Schumer and Mike Rounds</li>
    <li>Criticism: Mixed reactions from critics regarding unproven statements in the documentary</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The documentary “The Age of Disclosure” premiered earlier this year at the South by Southwest festival. Following its release, a secret screening was delayed due to a government shutdown. On Monday, lawmakers attended the Capitol Hill screening, where they engaged in discussions about the implications of the film.</p>
<p>During the screening, Secretary of State Marco Rubio cited instances of unidentified objects operating in restricted airspace, raising questions about their origins. Representative André Carson praised the film for connecting various media representations of UAP.</p>
<p>In conjunction with the screening, the UAP Disclosure Act was introduced, aiming to promote transparency regarding government information on UAP.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“There is a section in here that will bring context to all the fuzzy photos that we’ve seen.” - Representative André Carson, Democrat</blockquote>
<blockquote>“I think we’ve had enough hearings, and it is now time for hard evidence or ‘receipts.’” - Representative Eric Burlison, Republican</blockquote>
<blockquote>“I would work in Congress to reduce the stigma around reporting, strengthen our national security, and ensure U.A.P. records are being properly disclosed.” - Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, Democrat</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The topic of UFOs and UAP has gained renewed attention in recent years, with various reports and testimonies from military personnel contributing to public interest. The U.S. government has faced scrutiny over its handling of UAP information, leading to calls for greater transparency and accountability. The recent documentary and legislative proposals reflect an ongoing effort to address these concerns.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Lawmakers will continue to push for the UAP Disclosure Act, which seeks to reduce government secrecy regarding UAP. Investigations into UAP will likely remain a topic of interest as officials seek to clarify the nature and implications of these phenomena.</p>
