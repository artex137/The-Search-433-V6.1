      <h2>What is a Nucleus and How it Works in 3I/ATLAS Comet</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has exhibited unique chemical properties since its discovery, particularly its low levels of carbon chains and high carbon dioxide content. The comet's nucleus is a solid body composed of frozen gases, dust, rock, and organic molecules, and it has traveled for billions of years through space. Observations of 3I/ATLAS have revealed significant insights into its composition and behavior as it approaches the Sun.</p>

<p>This is significant as it provides scientists with valuable information about the formation of comets and the conditions in the early solar system. The study of 3I/ATLAS may also enhance our understanding of interstellar objects and their interactions with cosmic radiation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS shows low C₂ and C₃ levels but high CO₂.</li>
    <li>The nucleus contains water ice (H₂O), carbon dioxide (CO₂), carbon monoxide (CO), and OCS.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS has traveled for billions of years between stars.</li>
    <li>The nucleus is thought to be a few hundred meters to a few kilometers across.</li>
    <li>It has shown signs of sublimation at large distances from the Sun.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been observed as it travels through the solar system. Initial observations indicated its chemical makeup, particularly the carbon-chain depletion and high CO₂ levels. As it neared the Sun, scientists noted the sublimation of ices, which began with super-volatile gases like CO, followed by CO₂ and water ice. This process has allowed researchers to study the comet's jets and structural changes.</p>

<p>These observations have provided evidence of jet-driven activity, where the nucleus ejects gas and dust through vents or fractures as it warms. This activity has contributed to the comet's brightness and structural features.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The nucleus of 3I/ATLAS displays a chemical signature that sets it apart from typical Kuiper Belt or Oort Cloud comets,” said an astronomer involved in the study. “This is likely due to its long exposure to cosmic radiation.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is classified as an interstellar comet, which means it has spent significant time outside the protective magnetic fields of stars. This exposure to cosmic rays has altered its surface chemistry, creating a processed crust that traps organics and affects sublimation. Compared to other comets, 3I/ATLAS presents a unique opportunity to study the effects of prolonged cosmic radiation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun. Further observations will provide additional data on its chemical composition and behavior, enhancing our understanding of interstellar comets and their formation.</p>
