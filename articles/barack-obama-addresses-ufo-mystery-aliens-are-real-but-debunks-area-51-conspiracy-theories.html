      <h2>Barack Obama addresses UFO mystery: Aliens are ‘real’ but debunks Area 51 conspiracy theories</h2>

<p>Former US president Barack Obama has confirmed his belief in the existence of alien life during a podcast interview with YouTuber Brian Tyler Cowen, released on February 15, 2026. He stated, “They are real,” but acknowledged he has not encountered them personally and dismissed the notion that aliens are housed at Area 51. Obama’s comments come amid renewed public interest in unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) and associated conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>Obama’s remarks are significant as they reflect a growing openness about the topic of extraterrestrial life, a subject that has intrigued Americans for decades. His interview follows a series of government disclosures regarding UAPs that have sparked conversations about the potential existence of intelligent life beyond Earth.</p>
