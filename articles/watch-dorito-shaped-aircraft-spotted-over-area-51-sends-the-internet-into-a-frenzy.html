      <h2>Watch: ‘Dorito-shaped’ aircraft spotted over Area 51 sends the internet into a frenzy</h2>

<p>A mysterious 'dorito-shaped' aircraft has been spotted flying over Area 51 in southern Nevada at 3 a.m. on January 14, 2023. The sighting has sparked renewed theories of alien involvement and has caught the attention of online communities. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This sighting matters as it continues to fuel speculation surrounding the highly classified military base, which has long been a focal point for conspiracy theories and interest in unidentified aerial phenomena. Authorities have not commented on the sighting, but the incident has led to increased online chatter and theories regarding the nature of the aircraft.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Location: Area 51, southern Nevada</li>
    <li>Date and time: January 14, 2023, at 3 a.m.</li>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>At 3 a.m. on January 14, 2023, Anders Otteson recorded a video of a strange aircraft while in the desert near Area 51. The aircraft was described as having a unique shape distinct from the B-2 Spirit stealth bomber, which Otteson had filmed earlier that night.</p>

<p>Following the sighting, Otteson discussed the incident in a livestream with Joerg Arnu from Dreamland Resort. They noted an unusually high number of codewords picked up on an audio scanner that night, suggesting military operations may have been underway.</p>
