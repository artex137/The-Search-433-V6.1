      <h2>Trump Orders UFO File Release As Avi Loeb Urges Caution Over What Americans Should See</h2>

<p>On February 19, 2026, President Donald Trump directed the Department of Defense and other agencies to begin identifying and releasing files related to alien life and unidentified aerial phenomena. This announcement comes amid growing public interest and calls for transparency regarding these topics.</p>

<p>The directive aims to address public demand for clarity on unidentified aerial phenomena. However, Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has cautioned that much of the data remains classified due to its connection to sensitive intelligence systems. He has offered to assist government officials in reviewing evidence before it is made public, highlighting the need for careful consideration of what information is safe to disclose.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of directive: February 19, 2026</li>
    <li>Agencies involved: Department of Defense</li>
    <li>Key figure: Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb</li>
    <li>Secretary of Defense: Pete Hegseth</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>After President Trump's directive on February 19, 2026, agencies began the process of identifying relevant files. Loeb published a Medium post and appeared on national television shortly after the announcement, expressing both enthusiasm and caution regarding the potential release of classified information.</p>
<p>Loeb emphasized the importance of reviewing classified materials before public disclosure, particularly if they could expose defense vulnerabilities. He noted that the most anomalous data has not been seen by the public and remains classified for understandable reasons.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“If disclosure risks exposing those capabilities or revealing potential defense vulnerabilities, restraint or redactions may be justified,” said Loeb regarding the release of information.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loeb also stated, “The scientific question — whether any material or object could be of interstellar origin — is too important to ignore.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The push for transparency follows public interest in unidentified aerial phenomena, highlighted by recent comments attributed to former President Barack Obama. The directive by Trump marks a notable shift in the government's approach to declassifying information related to these topics.</p>
<p>Historically, the review of classified intelligence has been managed internally by defense and intelligence agencies. The involvement of external scientific figures in this process introduces a new dynamic in the ongoing debate over transparency and national security.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The next steps involve the Department of Defense identifying and reviewing files for potential release. How the administration handles the declassification process will likely influence public perception and trust in governmental transparency.</p>
