      <h2>UFO Tracker Reveals Thousands of USO Sightings Near US Coasts</h2>

<p>A popular UFO-reporting app, Enigma, has recorded thousands of sightings of Unidentified Submersible Objects (USOs) near US waterways since its launch in late 2022. High-ranking US Navy officials have expressed concerns that these underwater phenomena could pose a threat to national security.</p>

<p>The findings from Enigma, which describes itself as the "largest queryable historical sighting database for global UFO sightings," highlight an increasing interest in unidentified phenomena. The app has documented over 30,000 reports of Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) and Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena, with numerous instances of strange objects emerging from or plunging into the sea without causing a splash.</p>

<blockquote>“These USO sightings add a new dimension to the ongoing mystery of unidentified phenomena,” Enigma states.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
