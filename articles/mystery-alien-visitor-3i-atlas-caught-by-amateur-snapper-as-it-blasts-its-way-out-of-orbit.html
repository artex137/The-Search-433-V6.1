      <h2>Mystery Alien Visitor 3I/ATLAS Caught By Amateur Snapper As It Blasts Its Way Out Of Orbit</h2>

<p>A rare interstellar comet, known as Comet 3I/ATLAS, has been documented by an amateur astrophotographer, Patrick Finney, from his backyard in Portland, Oregon, as it accelerates away from Earth. The capture occurred during the new year, shortly after the comet made its closest approach to our planet on December 19, 2022.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it highlights the capabilities of amateur astronomers in documenting celestial phenomena. Finney’s image of the comet serves as a reminder that significant contributions to astronomy can come from enthusiasts, not just large observatories and government agencies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third known extrasolar visitor to our solar system.</li>
  <li>The comet made its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2022, at a distance of 270 million kilometres (1.8 AU).</li>
  <li>Patrick Finney captured a significant photograph of the comet on January 1, 2023.</li>
  <li>The comet was discovered approximately 675.9 million kilometres (420 million miles) away by the ATLAS survey telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile.</li>
  <li>Finney used a ZWO SeeStar S50 telescope for his capture.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered by the ATLAS survey telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile, and its origins trace back to the direction of the constellation Sagittarius. It made its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2022. Following its approach, Patrick Finney successfully photographed the comet as it began its retreat on January 1, 2023.</p>

<p>Finney's photograph notably captured the separation between the comet's nucleus and its tail, a detail that many other images failed to show.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third object in history from outside of our solar system to be discovered within our solar system,” said a spokesperson from NASA.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Most comets originate from the local Oort Cloud. Comet 3I/ATLAS is unique as it has travelled from beyond the sun's gravitational influence. It is a reminder of the ongoing interest and exploration of interstellar objects in our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As Comet 3I/ATLAS continues its journey out of the solar system, it will follow the expected laws of physics, gradually slowing down as it exits. The scientific community will likely continue to analyze the data collected from its approach and departure.</p>
