      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS will be eyed by Mars and Jupiter probes as it zooms past the sun this month</h2>

<p>The European Space Agency (ESA) is using spacecraft designed for Mars and Jupiter missions to track interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the sun in October 2025. First spotted in July 2025 by an ATLAS telescope in Chile, 3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object to pass through our solar system. There are no reported injuries or fatalities.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as it provides a rare opportunity to study an interstellar comet during its active phase. ESA and NASA missions will gather data on the comet's size, composition, and surface activity, which could help scientists understand the origins of such celestial bodies and their similarities to comets formed in our solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet travels at a velocity of approximately <strong>130,000 mph</strong> (219,000 km/h).</li>
    <li>The closest approach to Mars will occur on <strong>October 3, 2025</strong>, at a distance of <strong>30 million km</strong>.</li>
    <li>ESA’s Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (Juice) will observe the comet between <strong>November 2 and 25, 2025</strong>.</li>
    <li>The comet remains visible to ground-based telescopes until <strong>September 2025</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified by the ATLAS telescope in Chile in July 2025. Following its discovery, astronomers confirmed its interstellar origin due to its unusual trajectory and high velocity. As the comet approaches the sun, ESA has mobilized existing spacecraft to observe it during key moments of its journey.</p>

<p>On October 3, 2025, the comet will be closest to Mars, allowing for observations by Mars orbiters, including Mars Express and the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter. Subsequent observations by ESA’s Juice will begin shortly after the comet reaches perihelion, its closest approach to the sun, in late November.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“JUICE will be in the best position for the important period around the 3I/ATLAS perihelion, when observations from Earth will be the hardest,” said T. Marshall Eubanks, Chief Scientist at Space Initiatives Inc.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is significant as it offers insights into the composition of interstellar comets. Previous studies of comets from our solar system have provided a baseline for comparison. Observing 3I/ATLAS may reveal whether its chemical makeup resembles that of solar system comets or if it contains unique components from its extrasolar origin.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches perihelion, ESA and NASA will continue to gather data from their spacecraft. This data will be crucial for understanding the comet's activity and composition, providing valuable information about interstellar objects.</p>
