      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS turns emerald green</h2>
<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has shown a striking emerald green color in recent photos taken over Namibia during the “blood moon” lunar eclipse on September 7, 2025. Astronomers captured this unexpected change as the comet nears the halfway point of its journey through the solar system.</p>

<p>This color transformation offers valuable insights into the behavior of interstellar comets. Authorities, including NASA and astronomers worldwide, are investigating the phenomenon further to understand the implications of this change for future comet observations.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is approximately 277 million miles from Earth.</li>
    <li>The images were taken on September 7, 2025, during a lunar eclipse.</li>
    <li>The comet is categorized as an interstellar object due to its hyperbolic orbit.</li>
    <li>Astronomers have confirmed that the comet poses no threat to Earth.</li>
    <li>Astrophotographers Michael Jäger and Gerald Rhemann captured the images.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 21, 2025, the Hubble Space Telescope captured an image of comet 3I/ATLAS when it was 277 million miles from Earth. The comet displayed a teardrop-shaped cocoon of dust surrounding its icy nucleus. As the comet approached the Sun, it warmed up, leading to the release of dust and gas.</p>
<p>On September 7, 2025, during the blood moon lunar eclipse, Jäger and Rhemann photographed the comet, revealing its unexpected green hue. The darker sky conditions allowed for a clearer view of the comet's brightness.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The sudden change in color raises new questions about the activity of comets moving through the solar system,” said an unnamed astronomer. 
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object discovered. Previous comets, such as C/2022 E3 and SWAN25F, have also exhibited green colors as they approached the Sun. The phenomenon is linked to the release of rare chemicals and materials from the comet's core.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to monitor comet 3I/ATLAS to gather more data on its composition and the reasons behind its color change. Further observations may help confirm the presence of dicarbon and other materials contributing to the comet's emerald appearance.</p>
