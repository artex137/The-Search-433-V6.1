      <h2>'Spaceship' 3I/Atlas to make rare move near Sun ahead of 'opposition surge'</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/Atlas is set to reach a rare near-opposition alignment with the Sun on January 22, 2026, according to astrophysicist Avi Loeb from Harvard University. This alignment will allow scientists to observe the comet in unprecedented detail as it will be illuminated from behind Earth, raising questions about its composition and structure.</p>

<p>This event is significant because it offers a unique opportunity to investigate the comet, which has sparked debate about whether it might be an alien spaceship. Loeb has urged scientists to conduct coordinated observations before and after the alignment to gather crucial data about the comet's properties.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas will reach near-opposition alignment on January 22, 2026.</li>
    <li>The phase angle will be approximately 0.69 degrees.</li>
    <li>Observations are recommended from January 19 to January 26, 2026.</li>
    <li>Loeb has described the comet as Manhattan-sized.</li>
    <li>Coordinated observations are needed to mitigate weather-related data gaps.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In recent months, the comet 3I/Atlas has been the focus of scientific debate. On January 22, 2026, it will reach a unique alignment with the Earth and Sun, providing an opportunity for detailed observation. Loeb has emphasized the importance of studying the comet's albedo, structure, and composition during this time.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Observations before and after the alignment time offer an unprecedented opportunity which may not repeat for decades, for characterizing the albedo, structure, and composition of interstellar matter,” said Avi Loeb.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Coordinated observations from multiple sites are needed to improve temporal sampling and to mitigate weather-related data gaps,” Loeb added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The comet 3I/Atlas has generated interest due to its unusual characteristics, including its extended anti-tail and polarization properties. Loeb has previously suggested that the dust from the comet could provide insights into its origins and composition, distinguishing it from typical interstellar dust.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists are expected to prepare for coordinated observations leading up to and following the January 22 alignment to gather data that could clarify the nature of 3I/Atlas.</p>
