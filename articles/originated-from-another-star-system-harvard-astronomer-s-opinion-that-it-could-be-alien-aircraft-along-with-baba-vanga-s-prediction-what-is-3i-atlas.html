      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Intrudes Solar System, Sparks Scientific Debate</h2>

<p>The scientific community has reacted with astonishment to the arrival of an unidentified object, designated 3I/ATLAS (officially C/2025 N1), which has entered the solar system. NASA has been monitoring this object, which is presumed to be a comet, but its unusual movement has raised questions about its nature and origin.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it challenges existing understandings of celestial bodies in our solar system. Authorities, including NASA, are conducting ongoing observations to gather more data on 3I/ATLAS and its potential implications for the solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1)</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Approximately 130,000 kilometers per hour</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from the Sun:</strong> Approaching within 20 million kilometers</li>
    <li><strong>Size:</strong> Estimated at 24 kilometers in width</li>
    <li><strong>Observation agency:</strong> NASA</li>
    <li><strong>Next expected proximity to Earth:</strong> December 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>NASA has identified 3I/ATLAS as an interstellar visitor, with observations indicating its unique trajectory. The object moves toward the Sun, makes a U-turn, and returns, exhibiting sudden changes in speed. The Parker probe has approached within 6.1 million kilometers of the Sun, but 3I/ATLAS travels closer.</p>
<p>Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb has raised the possibility that this object could be an alien spacecraft, given its speed and movement patterns. Some scientists speculate it is composed of ancient materials, including ice and carbon-rich substances, suggesting unusual chemical reactions may be occurring.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb has stated, "The object’s movement is unlike anything we have seen before, raising questions about its origin and nature."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The arrival of 3I/ATLAS marks a notable event in the study of celestial bodies, as it is one of the first known interstellar objects to enter the solar system. Previous incidents of unidentified objects have prompted discussions about the potential for extraterrestrial life and the capabilities of current spacecraft.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth in December 2025, collecting data to better understand its composition and trajectory. Further studies are expected to clarify the nature of this interstellar visitor.</p>
