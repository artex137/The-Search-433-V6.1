      <h2>UFO whistleblowers reveal bombshell encounters to Congress and claim government threatened them to stay silent</h2>

<p>Three military whistleblowers have testified before Congress on September 9, 2025, detailing their encounters with unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs) and alleging that the US government has attempted to cover up these incidents. The veterans, part of the Navy and Air Force, spoke during the third congressional hearing on UAPs, revealing multiple sightings of strange crafts, including the infamous Tic-Tac-shaped vehicles.</p>

<p>This testimony is significant as it raises questions about government transparency regarding UAPs. The whistleblowers allege they faced retaliation for reporting their encounters, including threats and professional blacklisting. The hearing aims to shed light on these claims and the government's response to UAP sightings.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of hearing: September 9, 2025</li>
    <li>Location: United States Congress</li>
    <li>Whistleblowers: Three military veterans from the Navy and Air Force</li>
    <li>Key incidents: Sightings of giant triangles, glowing cubes, and Tic-Tac crafts</li>

</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On September 9, 2025, three military whistleblowers testified at a congressional hearing regarding their encounters with UAPs. The hearing followed previous discussions on government transparency about unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>
<p>Dylan Borland reported seeing a 100-foot triangle at Langley Air Force Base in Virginia in 2012. He claimed that after reporting this sighting, he faced retaliation from multiple government agencies. In 2023, Alexandro Wiggins, an active duty US Navy Senior Chief Petty Officer, witnessed multiple Tic-Tac crafts over the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Nuccetelli shared his experiences from 2003 to 2005 at Vandenberg Air Force Base, where he encountered several unexplained aerial phenomena.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “We have faced retaliation after reporting our encounters,” said Dylan Borland during his testimony.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “The role of whistleblowers is critical in exposing government wrongdoing,” stated Joe Spielberger, senior policy counsel at the Project On Government Oversight.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This hearing is part of a larger effort to address public concerns about UAPs. Previous congressional hearings have focused on the government's handling of sightings and investigations into UAPs. The recent testimonies highlight ongoing tensions between military personnel and government agencies regarding transparency and accountability.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Congress plans to continue its investigation into the allegations made by the whistleblowers. Further hearings and discussions are expected as lawmakers seek to understand the implications of these claims on national security and public trust.</p>
