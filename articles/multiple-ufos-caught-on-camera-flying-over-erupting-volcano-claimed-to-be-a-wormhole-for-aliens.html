      <h2>UFOs Captured on Camera Over Erupting Popocatépetl Volcano</h2>

<p>A swarm of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) has been seen flying over the Popocatépetl volcano in Mexico, sparking renewed speculation about the location being an alien portal. The incident occurred on Monday, October 2, 2025, when a webcam monitoring the volcano recorded a time-lapse video capturing dozens of glowing objects moving in various directions as the volcano erupted.</p>

<p>This sighting has drawn attention because Popocatépetl is known for its history of UFO sightings, with witnesses reporting strange objects in the vicinity for decades. Authorities and experts are examining the footage to determine the nature of the lights, with some suggesting they may be natural phenomena or insects rather than extraterrestrial activity.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event occurred on October 2, 2025.</li>
    <li>Location: Popocatépetl volcano, near Mexico City.</li>
    <li>Time-lapse video covered a period of 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>Multiple glowing objects were observed during the eruption.</li>
    <li>Alejandro Rojas, advisor at Enigma Labs, provided analysis of the footage.</li>
    <li>Previous UFO sightings at the volcano have been reported for decades.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 2, 2025, a webcam at Popocatépetl volcano captured a time-lapse video showing glowing objects flying over the erupting volcano. The video revealed dozens of lights appearing to move rapidly, leading to various interpretations of the footage.</p>

<p>In the past, Popocatépetl has been a site for numerous UFO sightings, with notable incidents occurring during volcanic activity. In 2023, a resident named Luis Guerra reported seeing a saucer-shaped object hovering above the volcano.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “What looks to be moving swiftly is actually moving much more slowly. So, airplanes, satellites, or anything else coming into the frame will appear to be zipping past when they are not,” said Alejandro Rojas, advisor at Enigma Labs.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “I do not see anything in this video that is particularly anomalous that could not be explained,” Rojas added.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Popocatépetl volcano has a long history of UFO sightings, often coinciding with volcanic activity. Jaime Maussan, a UFO researcher, has previously claimed that the volcano could serve as a “wormhole” for extraterrestrial craft, a theory that has not been substantiated. Rojas expressed skepticism about such claims, attributing the phenomena to natural explanations rather than alien activity.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities and experts will continue to analyze the video footage from Popocatépetl. Investigations into the claims surrounding the sightings may follow, but no further actions have been disclosed at this time.</p>
