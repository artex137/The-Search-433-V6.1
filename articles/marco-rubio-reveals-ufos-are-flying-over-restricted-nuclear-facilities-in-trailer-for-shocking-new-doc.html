      <h2>UFOs Reported Over Restricted Nuclear Facilities, Says Marco Rubio</h2>

<p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has stated that unidentified flying objects (UFOs) have been observed flying over restricted nuclear facilities, according to a trailer for the upcoming documentary "The Age of Disclosure," set to premiere on Prime Video on November 21. Rubio's comments were made during an interview with director Dan Farah, where he claimed, "We've had repeated instances of something operating in the airspace over restricted nuclear facilities — and it's not ours."</p>

<p>This revelation has drawn attention to the ongoing discourse about unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) and their implications for national security. The documentary aims to shed light on what it describes as an "80-year global cover-up of non-human intelligent life" and the potential risks associated with advanced technologies that could be reverse-engineered by adversarial nations.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Title of documentary: The Age of Disclosure</li>
    <li>Release date: November 21, 2023</li>
    <li>Streaming platform: Prime Video</li>
    <li>Theatrical run locations: New York City, Los Angeles, Washington, D.C.</li>
    <li>Number of government and military testimonies featured: 34</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The documentary debuted at the SXSW film festival earlier this year, generating significant interest and discussion regarding UAP and government transparency. The trailer has since sparked renewed debate over national security and the existence of non-human life.</p>

<p>In the trailer, Rubio and other officials, including Congressman André Carson, express concerns about the implications of advanced technologies linked to UAP. Carson stated, "These are otherworldly things that are performing maneuvers that haven't been seen."</p>

<p>Jay Stratton, the former head of the UAP Task Force, claimed, "I have seen with my own eyes non-human craft and non-human beings," further fueling speculation about the government's knowledge of these phenomena.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This is the biggest disinformation campaign in the history of the U.S. government,” Farah told Entertainment Weekly. “Clearly, the facts around this topic have been covered up for 80 years and kept from the public, and every single high-level, credible person I interviewed did not think that was right.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>Farah also remarked, “I think it was very eye-opening to me that every single person I interviewed was not questioning any of the base facts that we normal people are questioning. Are we alone in the universe? Does the U.S. government know more than it's told us? Those weren't questions.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discussion surrounding UAP has intensified in recent years, particularly after the establishment of the UAP Task Force by the U.S. government. This task force was created to investigate reports of unexplained aerial phenomena and their potential implications for national security. The documentary aims to address the perceived lack of transparency from government officials regarding these incidents.</p>

<p>High-profile figures such as Senators Kirsten Gillibrand and Mike Rounds, as well as former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, also appear in the film, indicating a bipartisan concern over the issue.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the documentary approaches its release, it is expected to prompt further discussions about UAP and government accountability. Rubio has hinted at the necessity for transparency in addressing these phenomena, suggesting that ongoing investigations may follow the film's debut.</p>
