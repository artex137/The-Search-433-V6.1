      <h2>Marco Rubio reveals UFOs are flying over 'restricted nuclear facilities' in trailer for shocking new doc</h2>

<p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has revealed that unidentified flying objects (UFOs) have been observed over restricted nuclear facilities, according to a trailer for the documentary <em>The Age of Disclosure</em>. The trailer debuted recently, announcing that the film will stream on Prime Video starting November 21, 2023.</p>

<p>This revelation is significant as it involves high-ranking officials from both political parties discussing national security concerns related to UFO sightings. The documentary aims to expose what it describes as an 80-year global cover-up regarding non-human intelligent life and the reverse-engineering of advanced technology. It features testimony from 34 members of the U.S. government, military, and intelligence communities.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Documentary title: <em>The Age of Disclosure</em></li>
    <li>Release date: November 21, 2023</li>
    <li>Streaming platform: Prime Video</li>
    <li>Theatrical run locations: New York City, Los Angeles, Washington, D.C.</li>
    <li>Number of officials interviewed: 34</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In a trailer released for <em>The Age of Disclosure</em>, Rubio discusses repeated instances of unidentified aerial phenomena over restricted nuclear sites.</p>
<p>Congressman André Carson and Jay Stratton, former head of the UAP Task Force, also provide commentary, with Stratton claiming to have seen non-human craft and beings.</p>
<p>The documentary will have an Oscar-qualifying theatrical run before its streaming release.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We've had repeated instances of something operating in the airspace over restricted nuclear facilities — and it's not ours,” said Marco Rubio in the trailer.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“These are otherworldly things that are performing maneuvers that haven't been seen,” stated Congressman André Carson.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“I have seen with my own eyes non-human craft and non-human beings,” claimed Jay Stratton.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“This is the biggest disinformation campaign in the history of the U.S. government,” said director Dan Farah.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This documentary follows a trend of increasing transparency and discussion regarding UFOs within U.S. government circles. Previous reports have suggested that military encounters with unidentified aerial phenomena have been underreported or misclassified.</p>
<p>The film aims to provoke thought on the implications of reverse-engineering technology from these phenomena, especially concerning national security.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the documentary prepares for its release, discussions are expected to continue regarding government transparency and the implications of UFO sightings on national security policies.</p>
