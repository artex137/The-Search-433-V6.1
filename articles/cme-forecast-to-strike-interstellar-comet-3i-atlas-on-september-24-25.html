      <h2>CME forecast to strike interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS on September 24-25</h2>

<p>A coronal mass ejection (CME) launched from the Sun on September 19, 2025, is predicted to collide with interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS on September 24 or 25, according to NASA’s ENLIL model. This event is significant as it coincides with the comet's brightness increasing 40-fold, just before it becomes obscured by the Sun's glare.</p>

<p>The interaction between the CME and the comet is rare and has not been documented before with an interstellar comet. Astronomers are keen to observe this event, as it may provide insight into the comet's behavior and characteristics. The comet has already shown a substantial increase in brightness, prompting heightened interest from the scientific community.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date of CME launch:</strong> September 19, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Projected impact dates:</strong> September 24-25, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Brightness increase:</strong> From magnitude +16 to +12</li>
    <li><strong>Comet discovery date:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Comet classification:</strong> Third known interstellar object</li>
    <li><strong>Observed gas coma size:</strong> 2.5 arcminutes</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered. Since early September, the comet's brightness has increased significantly, from magnitude +16 to +12. On September 9, a short tail was observed, and on September 17, images captured by Gerald Rhemann and Michael Jäger confirmed a surge in brightness.</p>
<p>The CME was launched on September 19, 2025, and is expected to impact the comet on September 24 or 25, during a critical observation window.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “What happens to an interstellar comet is anyone’s guess,” said Dr. Tony Phillips of SpaceWeather.com.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This event marks a unique opportunity for astronomers, as previous observations have noted CMEs striking Solar System comets, affecting their plasma tails. However, there has been no documented interaction with an interstellar comet before.</p>
<p>The comet's upcoming flyby of Mars in early October will also allow orbiting spacecraft to observe it closely, providing further chances to study its interaction with solar wind and planetary environments.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the CME approaches, astronomers will closely monitor the comet for changes in brightness and tail dynamics. This observation period represents a rare chance to gather data on an interstellar object in a solar environment before it becomes difficult to observe.</p>
