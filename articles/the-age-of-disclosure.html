      <h2>The Age of Disclosure</h2>

<p>The documentary film, The Age of Disclosure, premiered on Prime Video in late 2025 amid excitement from supporters advocating for transparency regarding Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP). The film's debut coincided with Global Disclosure Day on October 19, 2025, where figures like Danny Sheehan and the New Paradigm Institute promoted the event as a significant moment for potential revelations about government secrets related to UAP.</p>

<p>This subject is vital as it raises questions about the government's historical handling of UAP information and the implications for national security. Authorities have begun to engage with the public about UAP, but skepticism remains regarding the authenticity and significance of the information disclosed.</p>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In late 2025, The Age of Disclosure premiered on Prime Video. The film was marketed heavily by disclosurists, coinciding with Global Disclosure Day on October 19. Prominent figures in the UAP discussion, including podcaster Colin Cowherd and director Dan Farah, engaged audiences leading up to the film's release. The film aimed to address long-standing questions about UAP and government secrecy but received criticism for not presenting new information.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Another documentary film about how disclosure of alien contact is imminent… The Age of Disclosure is packaged and produced so well that naïve viewers may come away thinking that something strikingly original, shockingly new, and world-shaking is about to be loosed among the world.” - Michael Shermer, Skeptic editor</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The drama gets repeated over and over.” - Anonymous observer</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Age of Disclosure builds on decades of speculation and research into UAP, which have been a topic of public interest since at least the 1950s. Previous documentaries and reports have also sought to address government transparency regarding UFOs and alleged extraterrestrial contact. Despite ongoing inquiries and testimonies from government officials, many believe the conversation has not significantly progressed.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As interest in UAP continues, investigations by various government bodies and independent researchers are expected to persist. The ongoing dialogue around UAP will likely generate further documentaries and discussions, although the timeline for any substantial revelations remains uncertain.</p>
