      <h2>3I/ATLAS spewed pristine material as ice volcanoes erupted near the Sun, Spanish scientists find</h2>

<p>Spanish scientists have discovered that the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS released jets of ice and dust as it approached the Sun, causing ice volcanoes to erupt on its surface. The findings were reported in a study posted on November 24 to the preprint server arXiv.</p>

<p>This research is significant as it provides insight into the composition and behavior of 3I/ATLAS, which is only the third interstellar object observed. The study suggests that the comet is similar to other celestial bodies in our solar system, including dwarf planets, and could offer vital clues about the early universe.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is approximately 7-14 billion years old.</li>
    <li>The study was led by Josep Trigo-Rodríguez from the Institute of Space Sciences (CSIC/IEEC) in Spain.</li>
    <li>Observations occurred on October 29, 2023, as the comet neared perihelion.</li>
    <li>The Joan Oró Telescope at the Montsec Observatory in Catalonia was used for observations.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS approached within about 378 million kilometres of the Sun.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 29, 2023, scientists observed comet 3I/ATLAS as it approached its closest point to the Sun, known as perihelion. During this time, the comet brightened significantly, which is common for comets due to sublimation caused by solar heat and radiation. However, researchers noted that the sublimation was particularly intense as it neared the Sun.</p>

<p>The study details how jets of gas and dust were observed, indicating cryovolcanism on the comet's surface. Researchers believe these jets released pristine material that had been locked inside the comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Our findings show that 3I/ATLAS shares some properties with several bodies in our solar system,” said Josep Trigo-Rodríguez, the leading researcher of the study.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to this study, 3I/ATLAS was already noted for being an interstellar object, having traveled through space for billions of years. The comet’s behavior and composition provide important information regarding the conditions and materials present in the early universe.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey away from the Sun, researchers will analyze the data collected to further understand the comet's origins and its implications for interstellar objects.</p>
