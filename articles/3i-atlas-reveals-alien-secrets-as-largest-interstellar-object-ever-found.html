      <h2>3I/ATLAS Reveals Alien Secrets as Largest Interstellar Object Ever Found</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, the largest interstellar object ever tracked, has been observed travelling through our solar system since its discovery by the ATLAS system in Chile in July 2025. The comet, officially designated C/2025 N1 (ATLAS), reached its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, passing at a distance of 270 million kilometers.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it challenges current understandings of cosmic objects. Scientists have utilized major telescopes to analyze the comet's characteristics and behavior, which has sparked discussions about the implications for planetary defense and interstellar monitoring strategies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered: July 2025, by the ATLAS system in Chile</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance at closest approach: 270 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Core size: Between 440 meters and 5.6 kilometers wide</li>
    <li>Orbital eccentricity: 6.1, the highest ever recorded</li>
    <li>Perihelion (closest point to the sun): October 29, 2025</li>
    <li>Next major event: Close flyby of Jupiter scheduled for March 16, 2026</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS system. Following its discovery, astronomers began extensive observations using various telescopes. The comet reached its closest point to the sun on October 29, 2025, displaying intense activity as it warmed up. Scientists conducted a spectroscopic analysis that revealed an unusual chemical composition. The comet made its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, and is expected to fly by Jupiter on March 16, 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “3I/ATLAS serves as a cold, glowing reminder that we are part of a much larger, much older celestial story,” said a representative from the scientific community.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object, following 1I/‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Its discovery has prompted calls for a new global strategy for interstellar monitoring. The recently operational Vera C. Rubin Observatory is expected to identify dozens of similar objects annually, improving our ability to detect such interstellar visitors.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey out of the solar system, scientists will analyze data collected from various missions, including the Parker Solar Probe and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Results from the European Space Agency's Juice probe are expected in February 2026, contributing to ongoing research about interstellar objects.</p>
