      <h2>How Big is 3I/ATLAS? Could It Cover the Whole of Manhattan?</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, discovered on July 1, 2025, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Río Hurtado, Chile, has sparked interest among astronomers due to its unique characteristics and potential for study. The comet has not caused any injuries or fatalities.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it represents a rare opportunity to study material from beyond our solar system. Authorities, including NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA), are monitoring the comet's trajectory and composition, providing critical data on its properties and behavior.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered: July 1, 2025, in Río Hurtado, Chile.</li>
    <li>Perihelion: October 30, 2025, at 1.36 AU from the Sun.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Mars: October 3, 2025, at 0.19 AU.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2025, at 1.8 AU.</li>
    <li>Nucleus size estimate: 0.32 to 5.6 km, likely under 1 km.</li>
    <li>Coma dimensions: Dust coma reached 26,400 km by 24,700 km in July.</li>
    <li>CO2 coma radius: 348,000 km by mid-August 2025.</li>
    <li>Magnitude: Approximately 9.8 as of November 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS occurred on July 1, 2025, by ATLAS in Chile. Precovery images confirmed its trajectory back to May 2025, indicating its interstellar origin from the direction of Sagittarius. Observations from the James Webb Space Telescope in August 2025 revealed the comet's composition, including a nucleus rich in carbon dioxide and other volatiles.</p>

<p>In late June 2025, the comet's dust coma dimensions were recorded at 13,040 km, growing to over 180,000 km for the cyanide coma by September. The trajectory includes a perihelion on October 30, 2025, with various close approaches to planets in the solar system through early 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The growth of the coma has been unprecedented, highlighting the dynamic nature of interstellar comets,” said a representative from NASA.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS is part of a broader trend in astronomy, where interstellar objects provide insights into the materials and conditions beyond our solar system. Previous interstellar visitors have also sparked interest, though none have matched the size and activity of 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Ongoing observations from Hubble, JWST, and Mars missions will continue to refine our understanding of 3I/ATLAS as it approaches perihelion. Further data from December 2025 may provide additional insights into this interstellar comet.</p>
