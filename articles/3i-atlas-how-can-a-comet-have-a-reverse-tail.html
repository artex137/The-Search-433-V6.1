      <p class="byline">Published 2025-12-26 04:35 UTC</p>

      <h2>3I/ATLAS: How Can a Comet Have a Reverse Tail?</h2>

<p>Astronomers have observed comet 3I/ATLAS exhibiting a rare phenomenon: a tail that points toward the Sun. This observation marks the first time an interstellar comet has shown an anti-solar tail. The comet was studied over several nights in August using the Two-meter Twin Telescope in the Canary Islands.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it provides insights into the behavior of interstellar comets and their interaction with the solar environment. Researchers noted that the comet's tail contained oscillating jets, allowing them to deduce the rotation rate of its icy nucleus. This information is crucial for understanding the dynamics of celestial bodies from other planetary systems.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object after 'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov.</li>
    <li>The comet exhibited an anti-solar tail, a phenomenon not previously observed in interstellar comets.</li>
    <li>Observations took place over seven nights in August 2023.</li>
    <li>The nucleus of 3I/ATLAS rotates approximately every 15 and a half hours.</li>
    <li>Researchers used the Two-meter Twin Telescope located in the Canary Islands for their study.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In August 2023, astronomers utilized the Two-meter Twin Telescope to observe comet 3I/ATLAS over seven nights. During these observations, they identified the unusual anti-solar tail and the oscillating jets within it. The jets displayed a regular oscillation pattern every 7 hours and 45 minutes, leading to the determination of the nucleus's rotation rate.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The transformation of the coma into an anti-solar tail helps to understand how these distant visitors interact with our stellar environment,” researchers stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I/ATLAS, only two other interstellar comets have been confirmed: 'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. These comets, like 3I/ATLAS, originated from other planetary systems, offering valuable data regarding their formation and composition. Observations of interstellar comets are rare, making each discovery critical for understanding celestial dynamics.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As comet 3I/ATLAS continues to move away from the Solar System, the data collected will support ongoing analyses. Future observations of similar interstellar objects may provide further insights into the characteristics of comets from different stellar environments.</p>
