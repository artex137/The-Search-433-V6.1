      <h2>NTSB Confirms UFO Impact into United Airlines Jet That Injured Pilot</h2>

<p>The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has confirmed that a weather balloon likely struck a United Airlines jet on October 16, 2025, near Moab, Utah, injuring the pilot. The incident occurred at 6:43 am local time when United Airlines flight 1093, a Boeing 737-8, was in-flight from Denver to Los Angeles and diverted to Salt Lake City after the collision.</p>

<p>This incident highlights the potential dangers of unmonitored aerial objects. Authorities are now investigating the circumstances of the collision, including the status of weather balloons in the area and the safety measures in place for such operations.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Incident date: October 16, 2025</li>
    <li>Time of collision: 6:43 am local time</li>
    <li>Location: Near Moab, Utah</li>
    <li>Aircraft: United Airlines flight 1093, Boeing 737-8</li>
    <li>Injuries: Pilot sustained multiple superficial lacerations; first officer uninjured</li>
    <li>Weather balloon launched from: Spokane, Washington, at 11:29 am local time on October 15, 2025</li>
    <li>Last transmitted location of the balloon: 8.3 nautical miles from impact site</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 15, 2025, WindBorne Systems Inc. launched a global sounding balloon (GSB) from Spokane, Washington. The balloon traveled south through Oregon and Nevada before heading northeast toward Utah. On October 16, at 6:43 am, United Airlines flight 1093 collided with the balloon while cruising at 36,000 feet. Following the impact, the flight diverted to Salt Lake City.</p>
<p>The NTSB has since gathered data regarding the weather balloon's position and the flight's data and cockpit voice recorders for further analysis.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Yes, I think this was a WindBorne balloon. We learned about UA1093 and the potential that it was related to one of our balloons at 11pm PT on Sunday and immediately looked into it,” said WindBorne Systems CEO John Dean on X.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“We file NOTAMs, follow all specifications required by FAA 14 CFR part 101, and share all live balloon positions with the FAA via API and our website. We have been coordinating with the FAA for the entire history of the company,” Dean added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident is part of a broader discussion regarding the safety of unmanned aerial objects. Weather balloons, like those operated by WindBorne Systems, are designed to collect atmospheric data but have raised concerns about potential collisions with commercial aircraft. The NTSB's investigation will likely examine existing protocols for balloon operations and their impact on air travel safety.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The NTSB is continuing its investigation into the incident, analyzing the damaged windshield and the flight data. The agency has not disclosed a timeline for its findings or any potential operational changes that may result from the investigation. WindBorne Systems is cooperating with the NTSB and FAA as part of the inquiry.</p>
