      <h2>Brightness of Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Decreasing</h2>

<p>The brightness of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has decreased significantly, dropping from a magnitude of 10.1 to 10.6 over the past few days, according to the Solar Astronomy Laboratory of the Russian Academy of Sciences. This represents a decline of approximately 37% in brightness as the comet moved closer to Earth, now about 10 million kilometers away.</p>

<p>This change in brightness is notable as it raises questions about the comet's behavior and visibility. Astronomers attribute the decrease primarily to the comet's increasing distance from the Sun, which affects its ability to reflect sunlight. Despite this decline, 3I/ATLAS remains one of the brightest comets currently observable, ranking fourth among nearly 100 visible objects in the sky.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS brightness has decreased from magnitude 10.1 to 10.6.</li>
    <li>The decline represents a 37% reduction in brightness.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is currently approximately 10 million kilometers from Earth.</li>
    <li>The comet is ranked fourth in brightness among visible comets.</li>
    <li>The brightest comet currently is C/2025 A6 (Lemmon).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In the days leading up to November 30, 2025, astronomers observed a significant drop in the brightness of comet 3I/ATLAS. The comet was moving closer to Earth, which typically would increase its visibility. However, despite this proximity, its brightness diminished due to factors related to its distance from the Sun.</p>
<p>As of November 30, 2025, the comet's brightness has decreased by approximately one-third, prompting further interest among astronomers regarding its internal processes and surface changes.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The decrease in brightness is mainly due to its increasing distance from the Sun,” officials from the Solar Astronomy Laboratory stated.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“New images of the comet reveal its unusual 'torn' shape, which appears variable and irregular,” they added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is among several comets currently observable, but its behavior has drawn particular attention due to its brightness fluctuations. Brightness in comets is generally linked to their proximity to the Sun and their reflective properties, which can change as they travel through space.</p>
<p>In recent months, other comets have also experienced significant changes in brightness, with C/2025 A6 (Lemmon) being noted for a nearly tenfold decrease in brightness over the past month.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>A safe window for observing comet 3I/ATLAS will reopen in 2–3 weeks, but NASA has not announced any plans for new observations using the Hubble or James Webb telescopes at this time.</p>
