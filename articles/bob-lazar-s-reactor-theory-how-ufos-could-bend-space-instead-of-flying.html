      <h2>'Bob Lazar’s Reactor Theory': How UFOs Could Bend Space Instead of Flying</h2>

<p>Bob Lazar's theory on UFO propulsion has gained attention as it suggests that unidentified flying objects (UFOs) can bend space instead of moving through it. This explanation addresses how UFOs reportedly make instant turns and travel at extreme speeds without the effects of inertia. Lazar has claimed he worked on a compact reactor inside a UFO at a site known as S-4, which allegedly utilized an unknown fuel source linked to Element 115 (Moscovium).</p>

<p>This theory is significant as it challenges conventional physics and has implications for our understanding of advanced propulsion systems. Authorities have not disclosed any formal investigations into Lazar's claims, but the ongoing interest in UFOs and related technologies continues to stimulate discussion in both scientific and UFO communities.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Bob Lazar worked on a reactor inside a UFO at S-4.</li>
    <li>The reactor allegedly ran on Element 115, which produces immense energy.</li>
    <li>Lazar first mentioned Element 115 in 1989; it was synthesized in 2003.</li>
    <li>The reactor created a gravitational field strong enough to distort space.</li>
    <li>UFOs could "pull" destinations closer rather than pushing through space.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 1989, Bob Lazar first introduced the concept of Element 115 in relation to UFO technology. At the time, the element had not yet been discovered on Earth. In 2003, Element 115 was synthesized, lending credibility to Lazar's claims about his experiences. Over the years, his descriptions of gravitational manipulation have sparked discussions in scientific circles, particularly in relation to modern concepts of warp drives and quantum gravity.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Lazar described a strong gravity field ‘bubble’ around the craft, which would shield it from external forces.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Bob Lazar's assertions have remained a focal point in discussions about UFOs since the late 1980s. Despite the lack of mainstream scientific validation for his reactor theory, recent studies on warp drives and negative energy have echoed some of his descriptions, keeping the conversation alive about the potential of advanced propulsion technologies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>While there are no current investigations into Lazar's claims, the ongoing interest in UFO technology may lead to further research and discussions in both scientific and public forums.</p>
