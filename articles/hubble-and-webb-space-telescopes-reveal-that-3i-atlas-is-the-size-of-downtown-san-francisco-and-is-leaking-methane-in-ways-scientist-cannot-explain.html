      <h2>Hubble and Webb Space Telescopes Reveal That 3I/ATLAS Is The Size of Downtown San Francisco And Is Leaking Methane In Ways Scientist Cannot Explain</h2>

<p>New data from the Hubble Space Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope has revealed that the interstellar object known as 3I/ATLAS is approximately 2.6 kilometers in diameter, comparable to downtown San Francisco. This discovery comes as scientists continue to analyze the object’s unusual methane emissions, which they have yet to fully explain. The findings were published following observations taken between December 2025 and January 2026.</p>

<p>This research is significant as it challenges existing models of comet formation and evolution. The unusual chemical activity of 3I/ATLAS raises questions about the nature of similar interstellar objects and their prevalence in the solar system. Researchers are currently investigating the implications of these findings for our understanding of celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS has an effective diameter of approximately 2.6 kilometers.</li>
    <li>The object is estimated to be 40 times more massive than 2I/Borisov and at least 20,000 times more massive than 1I/‘Oumuamua.</li>
    <li>Data was collected from December 2025 to January 2026.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS reached its closest point to the Sun on October 29, 2025.</li>
    <li>Observations revealed methane production rates between 14 percent and 27 percent of its water production rate.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In October 2025, 3I/ATLAS reached its perihelion, or closest point to the Sun. Following this, researchers noted a rapid decrease in brightness, suggesting changes in surface activity. By mid-December 2025, the James Webb Space Telescope captured detailed chemical data, revealing the presence of methane for the first time. This was significant as methane typically sublimates at lower temperatures than carbon dioxide, raising questions about its delayed appearance.</p>

<p>On January 22, 2026, an alignment of the Sun, Earth, and 3I/ATLAS resulted in a brightness surge, confirming predictions made by prior theoretical work. These observations have provided new insights into the object’s chemical composition and behavior.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The most conservative conclusion is that 3I/ATLAS has an internal structure and thermal history unlike anything previously observed,” researchers stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS adds to the growing body of knowledge about interstellar objects. Previous interstellar comets, such as 1I/‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have provided valuable insights, but none have exhibited the same level of methane activity. The findings from 3I/ATLAS suggest that there may be more large interstellar bodies within the solar system than previously thought, potentially expanding our understanding of celestial mechanics.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze data from Hubble and Webb to further understand the implications of 3I/ATLAS. Ongoing studies aim to clarify the object's unique chemical properties and its formation history, while the search for similar interstellar objects in the solar system will likely intensify.</p>
