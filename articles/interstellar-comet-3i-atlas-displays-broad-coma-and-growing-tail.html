      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Displays Broad Coma and Growing Tail</h2>

<p>Astronomers have captured new multi-color images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS using the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS) on the Gemini South telescope in the Chilean Andes. The images were taken on August 27, 2025, and show the comet's broad coma and an expanding tail.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it indicates that 3I/ATLAS has become more active while traveling through the inner Solar System. The comet is expected to reach its closest approach to the Sun on October 30, 2025, at a distance of 1.4 AU (210 million km or 130 million miles), just inside the orbit of Mars. Researchers aim to understand the comet's composition and how it changes as it moves through the Solar System.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile.</li>
    <li>The images were captured on August 27, 2025.</li>
    <li>The closest approach to the Sun is projected for October 30, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet is currently about 1.4 AU (210 million km or 130 million miles) from the Sun.</li>
    <li>The tail of the comet spans about 1/120th of a degree in the sky.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers discovered the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS in Chile. Following its discovery, the comet was observed multiple times, with significant imaging sessions occurring on August 27, 2025. These observations revealed a broad coma and a growing tail, indicating increased activity as the comet approaches the Sun.</p>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS nears its closest approach on October 30, 2025, researchers will continue to analyze its spectral data and physical characteristics to gain insights into its composition and the processes that shape celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“As 3I/ATLAS speeds back into the depths of interstellar space, these images are both a scientific milestone and a source of wonder,” said Dr. Karen Meech, an astronomer with the Institute for Astronomy at the University of Hawai’i.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“These observations provide both a breathtaking view and critical scientific data,” said Dr. Bryce Bolin, a researcher at Eureka Scientific.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“We were excited to see the growth of the tail, suggesting a change in the particles from the previous Gemini images, and we got our first glimpse of the chemistry from the spectrum,” Dr. Meech added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interstellar comets like 3I/ATLAS are rare visitors to the Solar System, offering unique opportunities to study the composition of celestial bodies from other star systems. Previous observations of such comets have provided insights into the diversity of planetary systems beyond our own.</p>
<p>The ATLAS survey, funded by NASA, aims to identify potentially hazardous asteroids and comets. The discovery of 3I/ATLAS highlights the importance of ongoing monitoring and research in understanding our cosmic environment.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze the spectral data from 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun. These observations will contribute to a better understanding of the comet's chemical composition and its behavior as it travels through the Solar System.</p>
