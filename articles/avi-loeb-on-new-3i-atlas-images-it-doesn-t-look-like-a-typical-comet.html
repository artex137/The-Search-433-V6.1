      <h2>Avi Loeb on new 3I/ATLAS images: ‘It doesn’t look like a typical comet’</h2>

<p>Harvard professor <strong>Avi Loeb</strong> has discussed the first images of comet <strong>3I/ATLAS</strong> after its recent pass by Mars on October 8, 2025. The early photos, released by international space agencies, indicate features that differ from those of a typical comet. However, NASA's higher-resolution images remain delayed due to a government shutdown.</p>

<p>This development is significant as it may provide new insights into the characteristics of 3I/ATLAS. Loeb has expressed optimism about forthcoming data, stating, “the best is yet to come.”</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event date: October 8, 2025</li>
    <li>Comet: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Location of pass: Near Mars</li>
    <li>Images released by: International space agencies</li>
    <li>NASA's images: Delayed due to government shutdown</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 8, 2025, comet 3I/ATLAS passed Mars. Following this event, early images were shared by various international space agencies, showcasing details that do not align with typical comet characteristics. However, NASA's higher-resolution images, which could provide more comprehensive data, have yet to be released due to ongoing government shutdown issues.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, “the best is yet to come.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is not the first time that unusual characteristics of comets have drawn attention from the scientific community. Comet 3I/ATLAS's unique features could contribute to ongoing research about the formation and behavior of comets in the solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA's upcoming release of higher-resolution images is anticipated, pending resolution of the government shutdown. Researchers will analyze the new data to further understand the properties of 3I/ATLAS.</p>
