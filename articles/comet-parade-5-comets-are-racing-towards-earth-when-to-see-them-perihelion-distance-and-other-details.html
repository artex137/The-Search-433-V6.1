      <h2>Comet alert: Five comets approaching Earth</h2>

<p>Five comets are approaching Earth and are expected to be visible to the naked eye over the coming months. These comets will reach their closest points to Earth at different times, starting from October 2025 and continuing into 2026. There have been no reports of injuries or fatalities related to these celestial events.</p>

<p>This is significant for stargazers and astronomy enthusiasts as it provides a rare opportunity to witness these comets. The astronomical community is actively monitoring their trajectories and brightness levels. Observers are encouraged to take advantage of the full window for viewing, which extends from October 2025 to January 2026.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comets:</strong> C/2025 A6 (Lemmon), 3I/Atlas, C/2024 E1 (Wierzchos)</li>
    <li><strong>First comet closest approach:</strong> C/2025 A6 (Lemmon) on October 21, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>3I/Atlas closest approach:</strong> December 18-19, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>C/2024 E1 (Wierzchos) closest approach:</strong> February 17, 2026</li>
    <li><strong>3I/Atlas diameter:</strong> 5.6 km</li>
    <li><strong>3I/Atlas speed:</strong> 200,000 km/h</li>
    <li><strong>Current distance of 3I/Atlas:</strong> 310,764,130.1 km from Earth</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The comets are on their way to Earth, with the first, C/2025 A6 (Lemmon), discovered on January 3, 2025. This comet last visited Earth in 629 and will next pass by in 3421. It will make its closest approach on October 21, 2025.</p>

<p>3I/Atlas, the third interstellar object ever observed, was discovered in 1911. It will come closest to Earth on December 18-19, 2025, and reach perihelion on January 8, 2026. Currently, it is located between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.</p>

<p>C/2024 E1 (Wierzchos) was discovered on March 3, 2024, and will make its closest approach on February 17, 2026, reaching perihelion on January 20, 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It might reach a magnitude of 5 or 4, which could make it visible to the naked eye from the darkest regions on Earth,” said Japanese comet expert Seiichi Yoshida regarding C/2025 A6 (Lemmon).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Harvard scientist Avi Loeb stated, “There is a high probability that 3I/Atlas is an alien probe,” citing its trajectory and brightness as reasons for his claim.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The comets have generated significant interest among astronomers and the general public. Prior to this, few comets have had such long orbital periods, making this a unique event for observers. The claims regarding 3I/Atlas being an alien probe have sparked discussions in the scientific community.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the comets approach, astronomers will continue to monitor their brightness and trajectories. Observers should prepare for viewing opportunities beginning in October 2025, with several events occurring into early 2026.</p>
