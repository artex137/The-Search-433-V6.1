      <h2>3I/ATLAS Changes Color Again</h2>
<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has changed color to a new blue hue after a recent brightening event, according to astronomers. This marks the third recorded color change since its discovery in July 2025. The comet, traveling at over 210,000 kilometers per hour, is currently moving closer to the Sun, which scientists believe may be causing the color transformations.</p>

<h2>Why This Matters</h2>
<p>The changing colors of 3I/ATLAS provide valuable insights into the composition and behavior of interstellar objects. Researchers are actively studying the comet, which is set to become more visible to observers on Earth in the coming months.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025.</li>
    <li>It reached perihelion, its closest point to the Sun, on October 29, at a distance of about 210 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>The comet is expected to become visible in the Northern Hemisphere during November and December 2025.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, at approximately 270 million kilometers away.</li>
    <li>A medium telescope or strong binoculars will be required to view the comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first spotted in early July 2025, moving toward the Sun. The comet appeared red initially, likely due to dust on its surface. In September, it changed to a green hue, attributed to gases such as dicarbon or cyanide. Following its perihelion on October 29, astronomers observed a rapid brightening event that led to the current blue coloration.</p>

<h2>Official Statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The brightening was much more intense than expected from solar heating alone,” said a researcher studying the comet. “We believe the surface has begun releasing gases that may explain the new blue hue.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object to visit our solar system. Its unique characteristics, including a hyperbolic trajectory, indicate it will not return after this pass. Previous color changes have raised interest among scientists seeking to understand the evolution of comets beyond our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth, researchers will have the opportunity to study the comet in greater detail. Observations will continue to monitor any further changes in its color and composition.</p>
