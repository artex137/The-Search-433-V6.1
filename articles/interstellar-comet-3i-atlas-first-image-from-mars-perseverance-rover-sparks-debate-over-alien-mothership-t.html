      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS first image from Mars Perseverance Rover sparks debate over alien mothership</h2>

<p>The first image of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, captured by NASA’s Perseverance rover on October 2, 2025, has ignited discussions among scientists and space enthusiasts. The photo shows a bright cylindrical shape moving across the Martian night sky, raising questions about the object's nature.</p>

<p>This image matters because it provides a rare view of an interstellar object, the third known visitor to the solar system. Authorities, including NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA), have confirmed that the comet poses no threat to Earth and will safely pass at a distance of approximately 170 million miles.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Date of image capture: October 2, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth at closest approach: 1.8 astronomical units (about 170 million miles)</li>
    <li>Speed: Approximately 60 km per second</li>
    <li>Diameter: About 46 kilometers</li>
    <li>First detected by NASA: July 1, 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, NASA first detected interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS. The comet passed by Mars on October 3, 2025, moving swiftly at around 60 km per second. On October 2, 2025, the Perseverance rover captured a time-lapse sequence of the comet as it streaked across the Martian sky.</p>
<p>Space enthusiasts, including Stefan Burns and Simeon Schmauß, began analyzing NASA's raw images to locate the comet. Burns compiled a sequence of images, while Schmauß reported a faint light near the comet’s expected position, possibly captured on October 1.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “After stacking 20 images from Mastcam-Z, I found a faint smudge of light in the constellation Corona Borealis near the predicted position,” said Simeon Schmauß regarding his findings.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar visitor to the solar system, following ‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Unlike typical comets, 3I/ATLAS follows a hyperbolic trajectory, meaning it will not return after passing through the solar system. Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has suggested that the object might not be natural, proposing it could be an alien probe. However, most scientists attribute its unusual features to natural cometary physics.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and ESA researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it passes through the solar system, ensuring that it remains a safe distance from Earth. Further analysis of the comet's characteristics will also take place to better understand its composition and trajectory.</p>
