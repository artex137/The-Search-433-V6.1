      <h2>Interstellar object 3I/ATLAS linked to 1977 Wow! signal</h2>
<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has been proposed as a possible source of the famous 1977 Wow! signal, according to Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb. Loeb made the claim in a blog post on September 28, suggesting a connection between the object and the signal detected by Ohio State University’s Big Ear radio telescope on August 15, 1977. The object was first spotted on July 1, 2023, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope in Río Hurtado, Chile.</p>

<p>This development has reignited interest in the Wow! signal, which remains unexplained after 48 years. Loeb emphasized the significance of the alignment of the two celestial phenomena, noting that the Wow! signal's direction is only 9 degrees away from that of 3I/ATLAS. This proposed link could reshape the understanding of both the signal and interstellar objects, highlighting the need for ongoing monitoring and research into the potential for extraterrestrial intelligence.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was detected on July 1, 2023, by the ATLAS telescope in Río Hurtado, Chile.</li>
    <li>The Wow! signal was captured on August 15, 1977, by Ohio State University’s Big Ear telescope.</li>
    <li>The comet's nucleus is estimated to be up to 5.6 kilometers in diameter.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS travels at a speed of approximately 220,000 kilometers per hour.</li>
    <li>It will pass closest to Earth at about 1.8 astronomical units (approximately 170 million miles).</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will reach its closest point to the Sun around October 30, 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2023, 3I/ATLAS was first detected by the ATLAS telescope in Chile. The object was classified as a comet by NASA, confirming its interstellar origin based on its hyperbolic trajectory.</p>
<p>On August 15, 1977, the Wow! signal was detected, leading to decades of analysis and speculation regarding its origin. Avi Loeb suggested a possible connection between the two events in a blog post on September 28, 2023.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The reason I suggested this hypothesis is to encourage radio observers to search for radio emission from 3I/ATLAS,” said Avi Loeb in his blog post. “If it is a comet of natural origin, no radio signal is expected at 1420 megahertz.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Any detection would suggest that 3I/ATLAS is alien technology, potentially explaining some of its anomalies, such as its unusually large mass, its alignment with the ecliptic plane of the planets and the glowing jet that it exhibited toward the Sun,” Loeb added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Wow! signal was a strong narrowband radio signal detected at a frequency of 1420 megahertz, which has been a topic of intrigue among scientists and the public alike. Its enigmatic nature has led to various theories about its extraterrestrial origins, but no definitive answers have emerged in the past 48 years.</p>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object to pass through the solar system, following 1I/2017 U1 (Oumuamua) and 2I/Borisov. The study of such objects is crucial for understanding the dynamics and composition of our galaxy.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Avi Loeb has called for radio observations of 3I/ATLAS to determine if it emits any signals, which could provide further insights into its nature and the potential for extraterrestrial technology. Scientists continue to monitor the comet as it approaches the Sun.</p>
