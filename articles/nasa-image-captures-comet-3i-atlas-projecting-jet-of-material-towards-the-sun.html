      <h2>NASA image captures comet 3I/ATLAS projecting jet of material towards the Sun</h2>

<p>Astronomers have released detailed images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, captured by Telescópio Gêmeo of Dois Metros at the Observatório of Teide in Ilhas Canárias on August 2, 2025. The comet, which was identified in June and confirmed by NASA in July 2025, is shown expelling a jet of gas and dust towards the Sun, a typical behavior for comets. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this event.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it enhances scientific understanding of the comet’s natural origin, countering earlier speculations that it might be an alien spacecraft. Researchers are now analyzing the data from these images to gain insights into the composition and behavior of 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date of observation:</strong> August 2, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> Observatório of Teide, Ilhas Canárias</li>
    <li><strong>Comet identification:</strong> Confirmed by NASA in July 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Estimated nucleus size:</strong> 5 to 11 kilometers wide</li>
    <li><strong>Number of exposures used:</strong> 159</li>
    <li><strong>Duration of each exposure:</strong> 50 seconds</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In late June 2025, astronomers detected comet 3I/ATLAS, generating interest due to its interstellar origin. NASA confirmed the comet’s classification in July. The images captured on August 2, 2025, showed the comet expelling material as it approached the Sun. The full set of images was publicly released on October 15, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Miquel Serra-Ricart, an astrophysicist at Observatório of Teide, stated, “The observed jet of material is a purely natural phenomenon, the result of known astrophysical processes, and has no connection with extraterrestrial activities or advanced technologies.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third object identified as originating outside the solar system, making it a valuable target for astronomical research. Previous theories suggesting it could be an alien spacecraft were quickly dismissed by the scientific community following detailed analysis of its characteristics and behavior.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS will continue to be monitored by telescopes worldwide. Researchers expect to collect new data in the coming months, which may provide further insights into the formation and evolution of distant star systems.</p>
