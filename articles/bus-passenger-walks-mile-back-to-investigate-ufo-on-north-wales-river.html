      <h2>Bus passenger walks mile back to investigate 'UFO' on North Wales river</h2>

<p>A bus passenger has walked a mile back along the River Dee in Denbighshire to investigate a large white disc he spotted on the water's surface on December 16, 2022. Gary Dixon, 62, from Flint, initially intended to take a winter trip to Llangollen but became captivated by the unusual sight, which he estimated to be a circular ice sheet measuring about 15 metres in diameter.</p>

<p>This incident has drawn attention to a rare natural phenomenon known as an ice disc, which is typically observed in colder regions. Authorities have not disclosed any ongoing investigations related to the sighting, but the phenomenon has sparked interest among researchers and the public alike.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Sighting occurred on December 16, 2022.</li>
    <li>Location: River Dee, near Lingo Pool, Denbighshire.</li>
    <li>Estimated size of ice disc: 15 metres in diameter.</li>
    <li>Observation duration: Approximately 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>Gary Dixon walked a mile back along the riverbank to investigate.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On December 16, 2022, Gary Dixon spotted a massive white disc while riding a bus. He exited the bus in Llangollen and retraced his steps along the riverbank to find the disc. After watching it for about half an hour, he described it as fascinating and unusual.</p>
<p>Dixon estimated the disc was rotating at about 1 mph and assumed it was caused by a whirlpool effect in the river. He later lost his phone during the encounter but was fortunate to recover it after contacting a local tourist centre.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I first spotted it through trees from the bus... I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. So, from Llangollen, I walked back east along the old railway track to find it.” - Gary Dixon</blockquote>
<blockquote>“It was fascinating to watch the disc as it slowly spun around several times – I estimated it was rotating at 1 mph.” - Gary Dixon</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Ice discs, also known as ice circles or ice carousels, have been observed globally, including notable instances in North America. The phenomenon was first documented on Connecticut's Mianus River in 1895. More recently, a 298-foot-wide ice disc was spotted in Maine in January 2019, followed by a 650-foot disc identified in Canada's Northwest Territories in 2021.</p>
<p>In the UK, such formations are uncommon but have been recorded in Wales in December 2008 and January 2023. Researchers have proposed several theories regarding their formation, including the influence of river currents and temperature variations.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>There are currently no known investigations or charges related to the sighting. The phenomenon continues to intrigue both the scientific community and the public, prompting further interest in the study of ice discs and similar formations.</p>
