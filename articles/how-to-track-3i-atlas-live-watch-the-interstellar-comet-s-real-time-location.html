      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Approaches Solar System</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, discovered on July 1, 2025, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Río Hurtado, Chile, is currently approaching the Sun. The comet is estimated to be moving at approximately 137,000 miles per hour (221,000 kilometers per hour) and is located about 410 million miles (670 million kilometers) from the Sun. There are no reported injuries or fatalities related to its trajectory.</p>

<p>The arrival of 3I/ATLAS is significant as it marks only the third confirmed interstellar object in our solar system. Authorities, including NASA and ESA scientists, are tracking the comet closely to gather data about its composition and trajectory, particularly as it nears perihelion, which is expected to occur around October 29-30, 2025.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered: July 1, 2025, by ATLAS in Río Hurtado, Chile</li>
    <li>Current speed: Approximately 137,000 mph (221,000 km/h)</li>
    <li>Distance from the Sun: About 410 million miles (670 million kilometers)</li>
    <li>Perihelion: Expected around October 29-30, 2025, at 1.356 AU (203 million kilometers)</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2025, at 1.8 AU (269 million kilometers)</li>
    <li>Magnitude: Approximately 14.7, visible only through telescopes</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has a notable trajectory:</p>
<ul>
    <li>June 14, 2025: Pre-discovery observations indicate the comet was already on its path towards the Sun.</li>
    <li>July 1, 2025: Official discovery by ATLAS.</li>
    <li>July 21, 2025: Hubble Space Telescope captures images revealing a teardrop-shaped coma of dust.</li>
    <li>August 6-15, 2025: James Webb Space Telescope and SPHEREx detect water vapor emissions from the comet.</li>
    <li>October 29-30, 2025: Expected perihelion.</li>
    <li>December 19, 2025: Closest approach to Earth.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The consensus among NASA and ESA scientists leans toward a natural interstellar comet, supported by spectroscopic evidence of water and dust activity,” said a spokesperson from NASA.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “3I/ATLAS provides a unique opportunity to study the composition of interstellar objects, potentially enhancing our understanding of the formation of our solar system,” an ESA representative stated.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object confirmed in our solar system, following 1I/'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. The study of such objects can yield insights into the formation of planetary systems beyond our own.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches perihelion, scientists will continue to monitor its behavior closely. Observations will help clarify its nature, including ongoing debates about its classification as a comet versus a potential technological object.</p>
