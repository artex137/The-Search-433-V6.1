      <h2>3I/ATLAS, interstellar comet, ends visit to Earth and heads to deep space</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has completed its visit to the Solar System, reaching its closest point to Earth on December 19, 2025, before beginning its journey back to deep space. The comet, which passed at a safe distance of approximately 270 million kilometers, posed no threat of collision but provided a unique opportunity for scientific study.</p>

<p>This event is significant for the global astronomical community as it marks the third confirmed interstellar visitor to cross the Solar System. Scientists have closely monitored 3I/ATLAS using ground- and space-based telescopes to analyze its composition and behavior. The data collected will contribute to a better understanding of the formation of distant worlds and the nature of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to Earth:</strong> December 19, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Earth at closest approach:</strong> 270 million kilometers (1.8 astronomical units)</li>
    <li><strong>Relative speed:</strong> Greater than 200,000 km/h</li>
    <li><strong>Perihelion (closest approach to the Sun):</strong> October 29, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Expected distant encounter with Jupiter:</strong> 2026</li>
    <li><strong>Estimated age:</strong> Over 7 billion years</li>
    <li><strong>Diameter of nucleus:</strong> Between 440 meters and 5.6 kilometers</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was detected by the ATLAS system on July 1, 2025. Observations suggested an unusual trajectory, leading to its classification as an interstellar object. The comet entered the Solar System from the constellation Sagittarius and approached the Sun, reaching perihelion on October 29, 2025. It then continued its path towards Earth, making its closest approach on December 19, 2025.</p>

<p>During its journey, 3I/ATLAS exhibited significant cometary activity, including gas and dust emissions. Scientists utilized advanced instruments, including the Hubble Space Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope, to capture detailed images and spectral data.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The passage of 3I/ATLAS allows us to study primordial material from another star system, offering valuable insights into the formation of distant worlds,” said a representative from NASA.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar comet ever observed, following 1I/‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Its hyperbolic trajectory confirms it is not bound to the Solar System, indicating its origin in another star system. The comet's observations have provided a rare opportunity to compare its characteristics with those of native Solar System comets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues on its path, scientists will analyze the data collected during its visit for years to come. This research will enhance understanding of interstellar objects and may lead to future discoveries as tracking and detection programs advance.</p>
