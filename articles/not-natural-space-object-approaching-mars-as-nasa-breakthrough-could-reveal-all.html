      <h2>'Not natural' space object approaching Mars as NASA breakthrough could reveal all</h2>

<p>A space object named 3I/ATLAS is approaching Mars, having been first spotted by astronomers on 1 July. It was initially described as a "potentially hostile alien threat" but has since been confirmed as a massive interstellar comet. The object is currently within 30 million kilometres of the Red Planet.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it provides an opportunity for scientists to gather new insights about interstellar objects. The European Space Agency (ESA) has begun tracking 3I/ATLAS with its Mars orbiters, while NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter is expected to capture detailed images soon.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object name: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>First spotted: 1 July 2023</li>
    <li>Distance from Mars: 30 million kilometres</li>
    <li>ESA orbiters involved: ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter and Mars Express</li>
    <li>Expected resolution of NASA images: 30 kilometres per pixel</li>
    <li>Confirmed as third comet from outside our Solar System</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 1 July 2023, astronomers first observed 3I/ATLAS racing through space at nearly twice the speed of typical interstellar objects. Following further analysis, it was confirmed to be a large interstellar comet.</p>
<p>Recently, the ESA's Mars orbiters captured images of 3I/ATLAS, revealing it as a fuzzy white dot with an icy-rock nucleus and surrounding coma. The comet is now being closely monitored as it approaches Mars.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "Though our Mars orbiters continue to make impressive contributions to Mars science, it’s always extra exciting to see them responding to unexpected situations like this one," said Colin Wilson, a Mars Express and ExoMars project scientist at ESA.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "We eagerly await NASA's data," wrote Avi Loeb, head of the Galileo Project and founding director of Harvard University’s Black Hole Initiative.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third comet recorded to originate from outside our Solar System, following 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. These interstellar comets are believed to hold vital information about the formation of distant worlds.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter is set to capture images of 3I/ATLAS, which will provide crucial data on the comet's characteristics and composition. Further analysis of this data is anticipated to yield new insights into interstellar objects.</p>
