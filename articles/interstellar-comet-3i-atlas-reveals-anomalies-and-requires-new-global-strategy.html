      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS reveals anomalies and requires new global strategy</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, discovered in July 2025 by the ATLAS system in Chile, has drawn significant interest from scientists following its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of approximately 270 million kilometers. The comet, classified as C/2025 N1 (ATLAS), is on a hyperbolic trajectory that will take it outside the Solar System, with an approach to Jupiter scheduled for March 16, 2026.</p>

<p>This discovery is important because it provides insights into the composition and behavior of interstellar objects, which differ from local comets. Scientists from various global institutions have observed the comet, revealing details that could enhance our understanding of the chemical diversity in the Milky Way and improve planetary defense models.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered: July 2025 by ATLAS in Chile</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2025, at 270 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Next significant approach: Jupiter on March 16, 2026</li>
    <li>Perihelion: October 29, 2025, at 210 million kilometers from the Sun</li>
    <li>Core diameter: Estimated between 440 meters and 5.6 kilometers</li>
    <li>Composition: Rich in carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and traces of cyanide and atomic nickel</li>
    <li>Visible: In the pre-dawn sky until spring 2026</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was initially identified as a possible asteroid in July 2025. Observations soon confirmed its cometary nature due to the detection of a marginal coma and tail-like structure. Perihelion occurred on October 29, 2025, revealing accelerated brightness and a bluish color attributed to volatile sublimation.</p>

<p>Following its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, multiple space missions, including the Parker Solar Probe and ESA’s Juice probe, gathered additional data. The comet continues to exhibit unique activity, including asymmetric jets and anti-tail oscillations, noted in December 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The passage of 3I/ATLAS represents a unique opportunity to analyze primordial material from another star system,” said a spokesperson from the Observatório Vera C. Rubin. “This will enhance our understanding of interstellar objects and their origins.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object, following 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Its hyperbolic velocity indicates an origin from outside the Solar System, likely from a region with older stars, suggesting an age greater than billions of years. The observations of 3I/ATLAS underscore the importance of ongoing sky monitoring to capture rare phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS moves away towards interstellar space, scientists will continue to analyze the data collected from various missions. The ongoing observations will aid in improving detection capabilities for future interstellar objects, with the potential to identify dozens of similar visitors in the coming years.</p>
