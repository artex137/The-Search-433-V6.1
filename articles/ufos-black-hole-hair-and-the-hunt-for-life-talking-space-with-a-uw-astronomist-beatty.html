      <h2>UFOs, black hole hair and the hunt for life: Talking space with a UW astronomist Beatty</h2>

<p>University of Wisconsin-Madison Astronomy Professor Dr. Thomas Beatty has discussed his work on the James Webb Space Telescope and the search for extraterrestrial life during an interview on La Crosse Talk. The interview aired on December 6, 2025, and highlighted Beatty's belief that proof of life on another planet may be discovered within the next 30 years.</p>

<p>This conversation is significant as it reflects ongoing efforts by scientists to explore the cosmos and understand the potential for life beyond Earth. Authorities and researchers, including Beatty, are utilizing advanced technology to study exoplanets and their atmospheres, which may indicate whether they can support life.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of interview: December 6, 2025</li>
    <li>Location: La Crosse, Wisconsin</li>
    <li>Event: Discussion on La Crosse Talk</li>
    <li>Professor: Dr. Thomas Beatty, UW-Madison</li>
    <li>Upcoming event: February 1, 2026, at 11:30 a.m. in Madison</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Dr. Thomas Beatty has served as an instrument scientist on the James Webb Space Telescope for the past four years. He has prepared the telescope camera and worked with a major telescope in Arizona to confirm new planet discoveries. Beatty's focus includes studying exoplanets that may resemble Earth and analyzing their atmospheres for signs of life.</p>
<p>During the interview, Beatty also addressed the topic of Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs), commonly known as UFOs. He noted that many reported sightings are likely the result of detector glitches.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I believe we are close to discovering we’re not alone in the universe,” said Dr. Beatty.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“We look for indicators such as oxygen in the atmospheres of exoplanets to determine if they are in the ‘Goldilocks Zone’ capable of supporting life,” he added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The search for extraterrestrial life has gained momentum in recent years, particularly with advancements in space telescopes like the James Webb Space Telescope. Beatty's work is part of a broader scientific initiative to explore the possibilities of life beyond Earth, a topic that has intrigued scientists and the public alike.</p>
<p>Prior discussions around UAPs have often led to speculation; however, experts like Beatty emphasize the importance of scientific analysis in understanding these phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Dr. Beatty will continue his outreach efforts as part of the Badger Talks series, with his next event scheduled for February 1, 2026. Researchers are expected to keep investigating exoplanets and their atmospheres in the ongoing search for life beyond our planet.</p>
