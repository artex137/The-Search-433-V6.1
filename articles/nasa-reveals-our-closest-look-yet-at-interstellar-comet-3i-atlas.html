      <h2>NASA Reveals Our Closest Look Yet at Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>NASA has released a series of new images of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, including the closest observations to date, during an event on November 16, 2023. The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) provided the most detailed views of the comet as it passed near Mars.</p>

<p>This release is significant as it showcases the capabilities of multiple NASA missions which have been observing the comet since it was first detected by the ATLAS survey telescope on July 1, 2025. The agency aims to gather crucial data on this unusual celestial object, which is the first interstellar comet observed in the Solar System.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first spotted on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet reached perihelion on October 29, 2023.</li>
    <li>The closest approach to Earth will occur on December 19, 2023.</li>
    <li>The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter captured images at optical wavelengths.</li>
    <li>NASA's MAVEN orbiter observed the comet in ultraviolet wavelengths.</li>
    <li>The Perseverance rover also observed the comet from the Martian surface.</li>
    <li>NASA missions continued observations during the recent U.S. government shutdown.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the ATLAS survey telescope detected comet 3I/ATLAS. Following its discovery, various NASA missions began tracking the comet's path through the Solar System. The comet reached its closest point to the Sun on October 29, 2023, but was positioned on the opposite side of the Sun from Earth at that time.</p>
<p>NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter captured detailed images of the comet shortly after perihelion. Other missions, including MAVEN, Perseverance, and several solar observatories, also collected valuable data as the comet approached Mars.</p>
<p>On November 16, 2023, NASA shared the latest observations and images from these missions during a public event.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Comet 3I/ATLAS has … arrived at its closest point to the Sun when the Earth was on the wrong side for us to conveniently observe,” said NASA planetary scientist Tom Statler.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The comet was right inside the orbit of Mars,” noted Nikki Fox, associate administrator of the Science Mission Directorate.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“This object is a comet. It looks and behaves like a comet and all evidence points to it being a comet,” stated NASA associate administrator Amit Kshatriya.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable as the first interstellar comet observed in the Solar System, distinguishing it from other comets with origins solely within the Solar System. This event highlights ongoing advancements in astronomical observation techniques and the collaborative efforts of various NASA missions.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The closest approach of comet 3I/ATLAS to Earth is set for December 19, 2023. Astronomers will have the opportunity to capture additional observations with telescopes and cameras during this time.</p>
