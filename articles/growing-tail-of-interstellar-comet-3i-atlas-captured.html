      <h2>Growing Tail of Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Captured</h2>

<p>Astronomers and students have captured images of the growing tail of Comet 3I/ATLAS, only the third confirmed interstellar object to pass through our solar system, on August 27 at the Gemini South telescope in Chile. The images reveal a glowing coma and an expanding tail that has significantly increased in size since earlier observations.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it provides a rare opportunity to study material from beyond our solar neighborhood. As Comet 3I/ATLAS approaches the Sun, solar radiation heats its icy core, causing sublimation, which forms the coma and tail. The observations were part of a collaborative outreach initiative led by NSF NOIRLab and Shadow the Scientists, allowing students to participate in real-time scientific research.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event date: August 27</li>
    <li>Location: Gemini South telescope, Chile</li>
    <li>Lead researcher: Karen Meech, University of Hawai‘i Institute for Astronomy</li>
    <li>Collaboration: NSF NOIRLab and Shadow the Scientists</li>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered: July 2023</li>
    <li>Previous interstellar comets: ‘Oumuamua (2017) and 2I/Borisov (2019)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2023 by the ATLAS survey. On August 27, astronomers and students captured images of the comet's expanding tail at the Gemini South telescope in Chile. The collaborative outreach initiative allowed students to engage in real-time observations with professional astronomers.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This image is both a scientific milestone and a source of wonder,” said Karen Meech, reflecting on the comet’s journey through the inner solar system.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“These observations provide both a breathtaking view and critical scientific data,” said Bryce Bolin, research scientist from Eureka Scientific.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Every interstellar comet is a messenger from another star system, and by studying their light and color, we can begin to understand the diversity of worlds beyond our own,” Bolin added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is significant as it follows in the footsteps of previous interstellar comets, ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, which have provided insights into celestial bodies from other star systems. Unlike its predecessors, 3I/ATLAS offers a vivid tail, making it an exceptional subject for study.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As Comet 3I/ATLAS continues its voyage, scientists are racing to gather data before it disappears into interstellar space. The ongoing observations will help researchers learn more about the comet’s composition and origin.</p>
