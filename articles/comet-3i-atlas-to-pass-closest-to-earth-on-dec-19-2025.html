      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS to pass closest to Earth on Dec 19, 2025</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS will pass its closest point to Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of approximately 1.8 astronomical units, or 270 million kilometers. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this event.</p>

<p>This close approach is significant because 3I/ATLAS is an interstellar comet, making it only the third such comet detected so far. Authorities, including scientists from NASA and astronomers worldwide, are preparing to observe the comet as it becomes visible from the Northern Hemisphere.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance at closest approach: 1.8 astronomical units (270 million kilometers)</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun: October 30, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance at closest approach to the Sun: 1.4 astronomical units (210 million kilometers)</li>
    <li>Discovered: July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile</li>
    <li>Type of orbit: Hyperbolic</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the NASA-supported ATLAS telescope in Chile. It passed closest to the Sun on October 30, 2025, at a distance of approximately 210 million kilometers. The comet will reach its closest point to Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of 270 million kilometers.</p>

<p>As it moves away from the Sun, 3I/ATLAS will become visible from Earth, allowing astronomers to study its tail and coma, which are made up of dust and gas.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Despite the close approach in astronomical terms, 3I/ATLAS poses no risk to Earth,” said a spokesperson from NASA. “It will continue its journey outward from our Solar System.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar comet detected, following other notable comets in the past. Its hyperbolic orbit indicates that it originates from outside the Sun’s gravitational influence, providing a unique opportunity for scientific study.</p>

<p>The comet's close approach offers insight into materials from other parts of the galaxy, contributing to the understanding of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches its closest point to Earth, scientists will prepare to observe and analyze the comet’s composition and behavior under solar heat. This research aims to enhance knowledge about interstellar materials.</p>
