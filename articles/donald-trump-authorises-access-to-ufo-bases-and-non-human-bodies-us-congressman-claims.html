      <h2>Donald Trump ‘authorises access to UFO bases and non-human bodies’, US congressman claims</h2>

<p>The Trump administration has allegedly authorised access to classified UFO facilities, according to Missouri congressman Eric Burlison, who revealed the development during a recent interview. Burlison, a member of the Congressional Oversight Committee investigating Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs), made the claims about non-human bodies and UFO bases at an unspecified location and time.</p>

<p>This disclosure, if confirmed, could have significant implications for ongoing investigations into UAPs and the government's transparency regarding extraterrestrial phenomena. Authorities are currently reviewing the extent of access granted and the potential impact on future UAP investigations.</p>
