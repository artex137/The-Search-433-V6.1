      <h2>3I/Atlas shows extreme chemical richness as ALMA detects strongest methanol and hydrogen cyanide signals ever seen</h2>

<p>Scientists have discovered that the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has extremely high levels of methanol and hydrogen cyanide, according to findings from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Chile. This discovery was made during a series of observations from August to October 2025, marking a significant moment in the study of this rare celestial object.</p>

<p>The findings are important as they provide insights into the chemical composition of interstellar objects. The unusual levels of these chemicals in 3I/ATLAS, particularly as it approaches the Sun, could help scientists understand more about the formation of comets and the potential for life beyond Earth. Researchers, led by Nathan X. Roth, have closely monitored the comet to gather data on its chemical emissions.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object observed passing by the Sun.</li>
    <li>ALMA detected the strongest signals of methanol (CH₃OH) and hydrogen cyanide (HCN) ever recorded from a comet.</li>
    <li>Observations occurred between August and October 2025.</li>
    <li>High methanol-to-hydrogen cyanide ratios were recorded on September 12 and 15, 2025.</li>
    <li>ALMA is located in the Atacama Desert in Chile and is operated by an international collaboration.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In August 2025, a research team led by Nathan X. Roth began observations of 3I/ATLAS using ALMA's radio telescopes. The team conducted multiple studies, focusing on methanol on four days and hydrogen cyanide on two days. By September 12 and 15, the team noted unusually high ratios of methanol to hydrogen cyanide as the comet approached the Sun.</p>

<p>The observations continued through October 2025, allowing scientists to gather extensive data on the chemical emissions from the comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The methanol-to-hydrogen cyanide ratios measured were some of the highest ever recorded,” said Nathan X. Roth, lead researcher of the study.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“While the presence of methanol is intriguing, it does not serve as proof of life,” added Roth, addressing common misconceptions about the chemical's significance.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object observed passing through our solar system. Previous studies of comets have shown varying chemical compositions, but the levels found in 3I/ATLAS are particularly notable. The only other comet with stronger signals is C/2016 R2.</p>

<p>ALMA has been instrumental in the study of various celestial bodies, having previously detected potential signs of phosphine on Venus, which sparked discussions about the possibility of life.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to continue monitoring 3I/ATLAS to further understand its chemical behavior as it approaches the Sun. Ongoing studies will provide additional data that may enhance knowledge of interstellar objects and their implications for understanding the universe.</p>
