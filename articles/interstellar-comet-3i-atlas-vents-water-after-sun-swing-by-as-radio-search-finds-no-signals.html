      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS vents water after Sun swing-by as radio search finds no signals</h2>

<p>Scientists have observed interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS venting water after its perihelion pass around the Sun in late October 2025. The findings were reported on January 4, 2026, based on data from the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) and the Green Bank Telescope, which found no candidate technosignatures from the comet.</p>

<p>This research is significant as it provides insights into the behavior of 3I/ATLAS, the third confirmed interstellar object to enter the solar system. Scientists are keen to study this comet as it offers a rare opportunity to investigate materials formed around another star. Observations are time-sensitive, as the comet is already moving away from the Sun, making it more difficult to capture data.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of perihelion: Late October 2025</li>
    <li>Comet's distance from Sun at peak water production: 1.40 astronomical units (AU)</li>
    <li>Water production rate: 3.17 x 10<sup>29</sup> molecules per second</li>
    <li>Decline in water production by December 8: 1–2 x 10<sup>28</sup> molecules per second</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: Approximately 270 million km (1.8 AU)</li>
    <li>Speed relative to Sun: Up to 210,000 km/h</li>
    <li>Comet nucleus size estimate: Between 440 meters and 5.6 km</li>
    <li>Green Bank Telescope observation date: December 18, 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In late October 2025, interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to the Sun, leading to increased activity, including the release of water. On November 6, 2025, the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) detected the comet's hydrogen coma. By December 8, scientists noted a decline in water production.</p>

<p>On December 18, 2025, researchers using the Green Bank Telescope conducted a radio search for technosignatures and reported no evidence of artificial signals. These observations have since contributed to the understanding of the comet's behavior as it exits the solar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We report a nondetection of candidate signals down to the 100 mW level,” said Ben Jacobson-Bell, an astronomer at the University of California, Berkeley, regarding the Green Bank Telescope findings.</blockquote>

<blockquote>NASA has stated that the comet posed no threat to Earth and passed at a safe distance of approximately 270 million km.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable for being only the third confirmed interstellar object to enter the solar system. Previous studies of interstellar objects have focused primarily on their approach to the Sun, making after-perihelion data crucial for understanding their characteristics and behavior.</p>

<p>Speculation about the comet's nature has circulated, partly fueled by comments from Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb regarding observed features that suggest unusual behavior. However, current data supports the conclusion that 3I/ATLAS behaves like a typical comet.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey back to interstellar space, scientists will analyze the data collected to further understand its composition and behavior. Ongoing observations will focus on confirming the comet's characteristics and exploring potential avenues for future research.</p>
