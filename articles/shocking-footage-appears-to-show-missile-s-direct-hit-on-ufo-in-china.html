      <h2>Shocking footage appears to show missile's direct hit on 'UFO' in China</h2>

<p>A missile has reportedly struck an unidentified flying object (UFO) in Shandong Province, China, on Friday, September 12, at approximately 9 p.m. local time. Residents witnessed a bright object in the sky before it disintegrated in an explosion, but no injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This incident has generated considerable online speculation regarding the nature of the object and the missile strike. Authorities have not provided an official explanation, but the timing coincided with military exercises in the nearby Bohai Sea, where live weapons were reportedly being used.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Incident occurred on September 12, 2025, around 9 p.m. local time in Shandong Province.</li>
    <li>Residents recorded the event, capturing video footage of the explosion.</li>
    <li>Chinese military was conducting scheduled exercises in the Bohai Sea at the time.</li>
    <li>No official confirmation from Chinese authorities regarding the object or missile strike.</li>
    <li>Previous congressional hearing in the U.S. featured footage of a missile striking a UFO in Yemen.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On September 12, 2025, around 9 p.m. local time, residents in Shandong Province observed a slow-moving object in the sky. Shortly thereafter, videos emerged showing a missile being launched towards the object, resulting in a bright explosion. Speculation began online regarding the nature of the object, with some suggesting it could have been a drone or a meteor.</p>

<p>The Chinese military was conducting live-fire drills in the Bohai Sea during the same timeframe, which has led to further conjecture about the missile's target. On October 30, 2024, a similar incident involving a UFO was reported during a U.S. congressional hearing, where a military drone's missile failed to down the object.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Another UFO UAP has been shot down... This is definitely part of their reverse engineering program,” said an anonymous user on X, reflecting the online community's theories about the incident.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident follows a notable increase in military exercises by both the U.S. and Chinese armed forces in the Pacific region in 2025. Reports indicate that China has been conducting live-fire drills in the East China Sea, approximately 320 kilometers from where the explosion occurred. The incident has drawn parallels to a previous occurrence where a U.S. military drone's missile struck a UFO and failed to neutralize it.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the incident are ongoing, but no timeline for official statements from Chinese authorities has been disclosed. The nature of the object and the implications of the missile strike remain uncertain.</p>
