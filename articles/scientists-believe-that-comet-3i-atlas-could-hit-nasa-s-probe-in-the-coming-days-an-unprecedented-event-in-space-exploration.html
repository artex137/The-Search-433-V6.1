      <h2>Scientists believe that comet 3I/Atlas could "hit" NASA's probe in the coming days — an unprecedented event in space exploration</h2>

<p>Between October 30 and November 6, scientists have indicated that NASA's Europa Clipper spacecraft may cross the tail of comet 3I/Atlas, an interstellar object originating from outside the Solar System. This event could provide a rare opportunity for scientific observation, as it is uncommon for a ground-based probe to interact closely with particles from such a cosmic body.</p>

<p>This encounter is significant because it may allow for the collection of data from particles that could reveal insights into the formation of planets and stars in other regions of the galaxy. NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) are actively monitoring the situation, utilizing advanced tools and simulations to assess the potential risks and scientific benefits of the encounter.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet 3I/Atlas</strong> was discovered on July 1, 2023, by the ATLAS monitoring system in Chile.</li>
    <li>The closest approach of the comet to the Sun is expected on <strong>October 30, 2025</strong>.</li>
    <li>The Europa Clipper spacecraft may pass through the ion tail of the comet between <strong>October 30 and November 6, 2023</strong>.</li>
    <li>The tail of the comet extends for millions of kilometers and contains charged particles.</li>
    <li>Space telescopes, including the <strong>James Webb</strong>, have been monitoring comet 3I/Atlas.</li>
    <li>The comet's coma has unusual proportions of <strong>carbon dioxide</strong>, distinguishing it from known comets.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/Atlas was identified on July 1, 2023, by the ATLAS monitoring system in Chile. Following its discovery, calculations of its trajectory revealed it follows a hyperbolic path typical of objects from beyond the Solar System. Observations by space telescopes, including the James Webb, have noted its unique composition, particularly the unusual levels of carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>As the comet approaches its closest point to the Sun on October 30, 2025, researchers have simulated the interaction between the comet's tail and the Europa Clipper using software called "Talicatcher." These simulations have indicated that the spacecraft's alignment with the Sun and the comet will occur between October 30 and November 6, 2023.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The scientific potential of this encounter is enormous, as it would be the first time a terrestrial spacecraft has collected particles from a body in another star system,” said Samuel Grant, a researcher at the Finnish Meteorological Institute.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Understanding the composition of these particles could provide critical insights into how planets and stars form in different regions of the galaxy,” added Geraint Jones from the ESA.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/Atlas serves as a cosmic time capsule, preserving primordial materials that date back to the early solar system. Previous encounters with interstellar objects have been rare, making this potential interaction with Europa Clipper a historic moment in space exploration.</p>
<p>NASA and ESA have both mobilized resources to closely monitor the comet and assess the implications of this unique event. The collaboration between agencies highlights the importance of international efforts in space science.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the dates for the potential encounter approach, scientists will continue to monitor the trajectory of comet 3I/Atlas and the position of the Europa Clipper spacecraft. Further assessments will determine the extent of data collection and analysis that may result from this unprecedented interaction.</p>
