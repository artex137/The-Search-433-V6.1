      <h2>Thousands of underwater UFOs seen around US: Should we worry?</h2>

<p>A recent surge of Unidentified Submersible Objects (USOs) has been reported near the coastlines of the United States, with over 30,000 incidents logged since the Enigma app's launch in 2022. More than 9,000 of these sightings occurred this year alone, primarily within 16.09 km of US shores or major water bodies. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This increase in USO sightings has drawn attention from authorities, particularly retired US Navy Rear Admiral Tim Gallaudet. He has raised concerns about the implications of these unexplained incidents, suggesting that the government may not be fully transparent regarding what it knows about these phenomena.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Over 30,000 USO sightings reported since 2022.</li>
    <li>More than 9,000 sightings logged in 2023.</li>
    <li>California recorded 389 incidents; Florida had 306.</li>
    <li>One report included a video of glowing green lights under the ocean surface.</li>
    <li>Approximately 150 reports described objects hovering above or entering the water.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Since the launch of the Enigma app in 2022, the tracking of USO sightings has increased significantly. Notable concerns began in July 2019, when the USS Omaha tracked an unidentified object vanishing into the Pacific Ocean near San Diego. The Pentagon later verified this incident, confirming that the object entered the sea without leaving any debris or impact.</p>

<p>In 2023, the number of sightings has surged, with California and Florida emerging as the states with the highest reports. Maps released by Enigma indicate dense clusters of sightings along both coasts of the US.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The increasing number of credible cases should be taken seriously,” said Gallaudet in a report for the Sol Foundation. “Objects capable of moving seamlessly between air and sea could have world-changing implications.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Concerns over USOs have escalated since the USS Omaha incident in 2019. The phenomenon of unidentified objects entering US waters has prompted discussions about national security and the need for transparency from the Department of Defense regarding all-domain anomalous phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the USO sightings are ongoing. Authorities may be prompted to increase surveillance and research efforts to better understand these incidents and their potential implications.</p>
