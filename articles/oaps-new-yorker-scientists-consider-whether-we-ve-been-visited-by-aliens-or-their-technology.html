      <h2>Scientists consider whether we’ve been visited by aliens or their technology</h2>

<p>Scientists are examining the possibility of extraterrestrial visits and advanced technology, as discussions surrounding unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) gain traction. This inquiry has emerged in light of recent congressional hearings and ongoing investigations into UAPs, which have captured public and governmental interest.</p>

<p>The significance of these discussions lies in their implications for science, national security, and technological advancement. Authorities are forming a select committee with subpoena authority to gather information from the Pentagon and other sources regarding UAPs. This represents a shift from viewing UAPs as fringe phenomena to recognizing their potential impact on various sectors.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Recent congressional hearings on UAPs have taken place, with a focus on investigations by a task force.</li>
<li>A select committee has been requested to collect information on UAPs from the Pentagon.</li>
<li>Witnesses at the hearings have included U.S. Air Force veterans and UAP journalists.</li>
<li>The Wow! Signal, detected in 1977, remains a notable instance of a potential extraterrestrial signal.</li>
<li>Discussions will cover the implications of UAPs for science, national security, and innovation.</li>
<li>Key dates for upcoming hearings and briefings are April 29, April 30 or May 1, and the week of May 12.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In March 2023, a formal request for a select subcommittee to investigate UAPs was submitted. This was followed by a series of briefings and hearings scheduled for late April and early May.</p>
<p>On July 26, 2023, a significant UAP hearing took place, prompting calls from Congress for a select committee to gather more information. Discussions have since focused on the implications of UAPs in various fields.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
“Members of Congress have called for a select committee with subpoena authority to collect information from the Pentagon and elsewhere on unidentified flying objects.” 
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
“While it may be easy to jump to conclusions, there’s the much more likely scenario that this is a novel experience that we can learn from.” 
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous incidents, such as the Wow! Signal, have sparked interest in the search for extraterrestrial life. Detected in 1977, the signal showed characteristics consistent with a technological origin but has since been deemed less significant due to its singular occurrence.</p>
<p>Nick Pope, who led the U.F.O. program at the U.K.’s Ministry of Defense from 1991 to 1994, noted three potential reasons for alien visits: military reconnaissance, scientific study, and tourism.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into UAPs will continue, with further hearings and briefings scheduled in the coming months. The select committee is expected to play a vital role in collecting and analyzing information related to these phenomena.</p>
