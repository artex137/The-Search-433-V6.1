      <h2>3I/ATLAS Update: Harvard Physicist Puzzled by Alien Comet's Striking Color Change — It Glows Green</h2>

<p>The comet 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar object approaching Earth, has changed its color from red to green as it nears its closest approach on December 19, 2025. The transformation has raised questions among researchers, particularly theoretical physicist Avi Loeb from Harvard University, who is closely monitoring the comet's unusual behavior.</p>

<p>This color shift is significant as it has sparked renewed debate over the existence of extraterrestrial life and the nature of the comet itself. Authorities and astronomers are currently observing 3I/ATLAS closely, with its passage providing a rare opportunity to study an interstellar body.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: Comet 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Initial color: Red, observed before perihelion on September 4, 2025</li>
    <li>Current color: Green, observed post-perihelion</li>
    <li>Key observer: Avi Loeb, theoretical physicist at Harvard University</li>
    <li>Significant observation: Halo surrounding the comet linked to diatomic carbon (C2)</li>
    <li>Gamma-ray burst association: Coincided with the comet's discovery</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On September 4, 2025, images from the Gemini South telescope in Chile revealed a red glow around 3I/ATLAS, indicating its composition of dusty, rocky materials typical of comets. As the comet passed perihelion, its color shifted to green, attributed to changes in its molecular composition due to solar heat.</p>
<p>Avi Loeb noted the dramatic transformation, suggesting it might indicate a different chemical signature in the comet's gas plume. This change raises questions about the comet's origins and has fueled speculation about its nature.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "The color of the glowing halo appears green, possibly as a result of diatomic carbon (C2) molecules which emit green light," said Avi Loeb, emphasizing the implications of the color change.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "The change in colors from red to green means that the molecular composition of the plume of gas shed by 3I/ATLAS had changed near the Sun," Loeb added.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third known interstellar body to pass through our solar system, making its study particularly valuable. The scientific community remains skeptical of claims suggesting non-natural origins for the comet, emphasizing that comets are typically volatile, composed of ice and dust.</p>
<p>Previous observations have shown that as comets approach the Sun, their surface materials can change due to sublimation, revealing different gases and colors.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth, astronomers worldwide are preparing for the final observations. The ongoing study of the comet may provide insights into its composition and origins, whether as a natural phenomenon or as a candidate for alien technology.</p>
