      <h2>NASA confirms - James Webb detects exotic compounds in 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>NASA has confirmed that the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has detected exotic compounds in comet 3I/ATLAS, revealing significant changes in its surface due to cosmic radiation. This discovery was reported in a study published on arXiv, with findings detailing the comet's transformation over millions of years as it travels through our solar system.</p>

<p>This research is significant as it challenges the long-held belief that interstellar objects retain the chemical composition of their original solar systems. The study indicates that 3I/ATLAS has developed a thick, hardened crust, altered by over 7 billion years of exposure to high-energy particles. Scientists are now exploring how this transformation may provide insights into the processes affecting celestial bodies beyond our solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet travels at speeds exceeding <strong>210,000 km/h</strong>.</li>
    <li>It reached its closest point to the Sun on <strong>October 29, 2023</strong>.</li>
    <li>The comet has a surface layer approximately <strong>20 meters</strong> deep, filled with dense carbon dioxide.</li>
    <li>Researchers compared 3I/ATLAS to comet <strong>67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko</strong> from the Rosetta mission.</li>
    <li>The study titled “Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS: Evidence for Galactic Cosmic Ray Processing” is currently under review.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first discovered in July 2023. Since then, it has been traveling through our solar system, reaching its closest point to the Sun on October 29, 2023. During this approach, the comet's surface began to sublimate, releasing gases from its outer layer altered by radiation.</p>

<p>The study detailing these findings has been published on arXiv but is still under review. Researchers have noted that the effects of galactic radiation on 3I/ATLAS provide a unique opportunity to understand the transformation of materials in space over extended periods.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It is very slow, but over billions of years, the effect is very strong,” said Romain Maggiolo from the Royal Belgian Institute for Space Aeronomy.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to this study, scientists believed that interstellar objects preserved the chemical characteristics of their system of origin. The findings related to 3I/ATLAS suggest that cosmic radiation can significantly alter these characteristics over time. This discovery may lead to a reevaluation of the properties of other interstellar bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to continue observing 3I/ATLAS as it travels through the solar system, hoping that solar heat will erode its outer layers enough to reveal insights into its original core. Further analysis of the data collected by the James Webb Space Telescope will help enhance our understanding of interstellar objects.</p>
