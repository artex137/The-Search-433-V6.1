      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/Atlas Confirmed Crossing the Solar System</h2>

<p>Astronomers have confirmed the passage of the interstellar comet 3I/Atlas through the Solar System at a speed of 57 kilometers per second. The comet is on a hyperbolic trajectory that will not allow it to be captured by the Sun's gravity. It was detected by observatories monitoring the sky for near-Earth objects and represents the third known interstellar object following 1I/’Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov.</p>

<p>The passage of 3I/Atlas offers a unique opportunity for scientists to study material from another star system without launching a space probe. Research teams worldwide are mobilizing to collect data during its brief visit, which will contribute to a better understanding of planetary system formation and evolution.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet name: 3I/Atlas</li>
    <li>Speed: 57 km/s</li>
    <li>Trajectory: Hyperbolic</li>
    <li>Detected by: Various observatories</li>
    <li>Previous interstellar objects: 1I/’Oumuamua, 2I/Borisov</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas has been confirmed as an interstellar object due to its high initial speed and hyperbolic trajectory. Its closest approach to the Sun, known as perihelion, has been predicted, and its outward journey into deep space has been traced.</p>
<p>Observations have shown that the comet's speed significantly exceeds that of previous interstellar visitors, which enhances understanding of the environment from which it originated.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The detection of 3I/Atlas is a momentous occasion for astronomers, providing insights into the materials found in other star systems,” said a spokesperson from one of the observatories involved in the detection.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior interstellar objects, such as 1I/’Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have provided valuable data about the dynamics of celestial bodies outside the Solar System. The study of these objects helps refine models about the formation and evolution of planetary systems across the galaxy.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Observatories will continue to monitor 3I/Atlas to refine its orbital data and confirm predictions based on computer models. The scientific community eagerly awaits the first results from spectral analyses of the comet's surface and coma.</p>
