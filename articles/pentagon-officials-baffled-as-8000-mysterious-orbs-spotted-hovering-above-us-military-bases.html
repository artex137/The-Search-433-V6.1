      <h2>Pentagon officials baffled as 8,000 mysterious orbs spotted hovering above US military bases</h2>

<p>Pentagon officials are investigating the sighting of over <strong>8,000</strong> unidentified orbs reported hovering above US military bases from December 2022 to June 2025. The sightings have raised concerns, but there have been no reported injuries or fatalities associated with these events.</p>

<p>This analysis, conducted by Enigma, a platform for reporting UFO sightings, has revealed that <strong>422</strong> of these sightings involve metallic orbs specifically around military facilities. The Pentagon's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) is currently working to determine the nature of these objects, which have consistently appeared between <strong>1 a.m. and 4 a.m.</strong>. The majority of sightings have occurred in New York, California, and Arizona.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>8,000</strong> total UFO sightings reported from December 2022 to June 2025.</li>
    <li><strong>422</strong> sightings specifically involve metallic orbs around military bases.</li>
    <li>Most sightings occurred between <strong>1 a.m. and 4 a.m.</strong>.</li>
    <li>Hotspots include military facilities in <strong>New York, California, and Arizona</strong>.</li>
    <li>21 cases classified as unresolved in AARO's latest annual report covering <strong>757</strong> incidents from May 2023 to June 2024.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>From December 2022 to June 2025, reports of unidentified orbs began to emerge, leading to a comprehensive analysis by Enigma. The AARO has been actively investigating these sightings, classifying many as common objects, but some remain unexplained. In their annual report from May 2023 to June 2024, AARO identified 21 cases that lacked sufficient data for resolution.</p>

<p>In June 2024, witnesses reported seeing metallic orbs over Fort Hamilton in Brooklyn. Eyewitness accounts describe the objects as silent and capable of rapid movement, often vanishing without a trace.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Orbs and spheres continue to be one of our most commonly reported UAP [Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena] shapes,” Enigma's website noted.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick, former AARO director, presented footage of one of these orbs captured by a military MQ-9 Reaper drone in the Middle East in 2022.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“If aliens aren't behind these sightings, then they're evidence that a rival foreign power could be 'doing stuff in our backyard,'” Kirkpatrick stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This recent surge in sightings follows a long history of UFO reports, with many cases historically classified as military or civilian aircraft, drones, or other identifiable objects. However, the presence of these metallic orbs has sparked renewed interest in potential extraterrestrial life and advanced surveillance technologies.</p>

<p>Similar orb sightings have also been documented in areas outside the US, including Puerto Rico and the Middle East, raising questions about their origin and purpose.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The AARO will continue its investigations into these sightings. Authorities have not disclosed any specific timelines for the completion of these inquiries or potential future actions based on the findings.</p>
