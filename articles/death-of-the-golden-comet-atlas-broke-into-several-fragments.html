      <h2>Death of the golden comet: ATLAS broke into several fragments</h2>

<p>Comet C/2025 K1 ATLAS has broken up, with its nucleus splitting into several fragments, as confirmed by recent images taken on November 13. No injuries or fatalities have been reported as a result of the fragmentation.</p>

<p>This event is significant as C/2025 K1 ATLAS, discovered by the ATLAS system of robotic telescopes, has garnered attention for its unusual golden color and chemical composition. Astronomers are now closely monitoring the fragments to understand their trajectory and potential impact on interstellar space.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet C/2025 K1 ATLAS broke into fragments on November 13, 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet passed its perihelion on October 8, at a distance of 0.33 AU (50 million km) from the Sun.</li>
    <li>It was confirmed to have fragmented into at least three pieces.</li>
    <li>C/2025 K1 ATLAS is not an interstellar comet, unlike 3I/ATLAS.</li>
    <li>The comet originates from the Oort Cloud, a region of icy bodies at the Solar System's edge.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 8, 2023, C/2025 K1 ATLAS passed its perihelion, surprising scientists by surviving the close encounter with the Sun despite initial concerns about its fragility.</p>

<p>On November 10, images indicated that the comet's nucleus began to fragment. This was confirmed three days later on November 13, when astronomers reported that it had split into at least three separate fragments.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The peculiar chemical composition of C/2025 K1 ATLAS has contributed to its rare golden color,” said a representative from the ATLAS system. “We are now focusing on tracking the fragments to determine their future trajectories.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to this incident, astronomers had observed C/2025 K1 ATLAS as a unique object due to its low quantity of carbon-containing molecules, which resulted in its distinctive appearance. The ATLAS system, designed to detect near-Earth objects, has been instrumental in identifying both C/2025 K1 ATLAS and the more well-known interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to track the fragments of C/2025 K1 ATLAS to understand their trajectories and the implications of their ejection from the Solar System.</p>
