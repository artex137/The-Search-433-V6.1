      <h2>3I/ATLAS Leak Sparks NASA's Planetary Defense Activation</h2>

<p>A leaked video from Japan has claimed to show a large vessel associated with the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1), prompting NASA to activate its Planetary Defense Network. The footage, released recently, has not been independently verified and has generated discussion among both amateur and professional observers.</p>

<p>This development is significant as it marks the first time an interstellar object has been included in a structured observation campaign by NASA and the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN). Authorities have stated that 3I/ATLAS poses no immediate threat to Earth, but the observation campaign aims to enhance tracking techniques and study this rare visitor from outside the solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was discovered by the ATLAS telescope system on 1 July 2025.</li>
    <li>The object will reach perihelion near the Sun on 29-30 October 2025, at approximately 1.4 astronomical units (AU).</li>
    <li>Its closest approach to Earth is expected around 19 December 2025, at about 1.8 AU (approximately 270 million km).</li>
    <li>The leaked footage has not been verified by peer-reviewed literature.</li>
    <li>The IAWN observation campaign aims to improve tracking techniques for small bodies and test planetary defense readiness.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS may be over 7 billion years old, according to some researchers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 1 July 2025, the ATLAS telescope system discovered 3I/ATLAS, classifying it as an interstellar object due to its hyperbolic trajectory. The object is expected to pass closest to the Sun around 29-30 October 2025 and approach Earth on 19 December 2025. Recently, a Japanese group released footage claiming to show a large vessel associated with 3I/ATLAS, which has not been confirmed by scientific authorities.</p>

<p>Following the leak, NASA and IAWN initiated an observation campaign to monitor the interstellar object. The campaign aims to gather data on gas emissions, dust, and orbital changes as 3I/ATLAS moves away from the Sun and Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“NASA confirms that 3I/ATLAS poses no immediate threat to Earth. This campaign is precautionary and aimed at study and readiness,” said a NASA spokesperson.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The claims surrounding 3I/ATLAS have prompted discussions regarding the nature of interstellar objects. Some researchers, including Avi Loeb, have speculated that 3I/ATLAS might be artificial or host alien technology. However, mainstream scientific opinion generally supports a natural origin for the object, stating that its unusual features do not necessarily indicate artificiality.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>In the coming months, scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it travels away from the Sun and Earth. The observation campaign will collect data to clarify the object’s origin and composition while the claims regarding the leaked vessel footage remain under scrutiny.</p>
