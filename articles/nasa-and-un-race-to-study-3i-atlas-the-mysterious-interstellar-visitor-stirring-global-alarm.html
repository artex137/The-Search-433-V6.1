      <h2>NASA and UN Race to Study 3I/ATLAS — The Mysterious Interstellar Visitor Stirring Global Alarm</h2>

<p>A newly discovered interstellar object, named 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1), has garnered significant global attention after NASA confirmed it as the third known visitor from outside our Solar System. The object was first spotted on July 1, 2025, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope in Chile. NASA has stated that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth, despite online speculation and sensational headlines.</p>

<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS is important for scientific research, as it offers a rare opportunity to study material from beyond the Solar System. Authorities, including NASA and the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA), are currently coordinating efforts to monitor the object as it approaches the Sun, with a perihelion expected on October 30, 2025.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1)</li>
    <li><strong>Discovered:</strong> July 1, 2025, in Chile</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to the Sun:</strong> October 30, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Earth at closest approach:</strong> 1.8 AU (approximately 270 million km)</li>
    <li><strong>Nucleus size:</strong> Under 5.6 km wide</li>
    <li><strong>Monitoring agencies:</strong> NASA, European Space Agency (ESA), UNOOSA</li>
    <li><strong>Expected departure from the Solar System:</strong> Early 2026</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile. NASA confirmed the object's interstellar origin shortly thereafter. The comet will reach its closest approach to the Sun on October 30, 2025. Observations are ongoing, with scientists monitoring its behavior as it nears perihelion.</p>

<p>NASA anticipates that 3I/ATLAS will leave the Solar System by early 2026, after making its closest approach.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "It looks like a comet, it does comet things--the evidence is overwhelmingly pointing to this object being a natural body." 
    — Tom Statler, senior scientist at NASA's Planetary Science Division
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "The simplest explanation remains that it's a comet." 
    — Avi Loeb, Harvard astrophysicist
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS joins the ranks of previous interstellar visitors, such as 'Oumuamua in 2017 and Borisov in 2019. Each confirmed interstellar object provides scientists with an opportunity to study materials that may have originated from different planetary systems, enhancing our understanding of the universe.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and ESA will continue to track 3I/ATLAS as it passes through the inner Solar System. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) plans to conduct spectroscopic monitoring after the comet swings past the Sun and re-emerges in December 2025. The international scientific community remains vigilant in studying this celestial visitor.</p>
