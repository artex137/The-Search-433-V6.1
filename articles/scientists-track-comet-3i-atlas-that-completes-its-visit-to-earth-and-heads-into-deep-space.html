      <h2>Scientists track comet 3I/ATLAS that completes its visit to Earth and heads into deep space</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has completed its passage through the Solar System and is now on its way back into deep space after reaching its closest point to Earth on December 19, 2025. The comet approached Earth at a distance of approximately 270 million kilometers, which posed no risk of collision.</p>

<p>This event has provided a significant opportunity for the scientific community to gather data on the comet's composition and behavior. Researchers from various institutions have utilized a network of telescopes to study 3I/ATLAS, revealing important insights into its nature and origin.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2025, at 270 million kilometers (1.8 astronomical units).</li>
    <li>Relative speed: Exceeded 200,000 kilometers per hour.</li>
    <li>Perihelion (closest approach to the Sun): October 29, 2025.</li>
    <li>First detection: July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope system in Chile.</li>
    <li>Diameter of the nucleus: Estimated between 440 meters and 5.6 kilometers.</li>
    <li>Expected distant encounter with Jupiter: 2026.</li>
    <li>Origin: Likely from the thick disk of the Milky Way, over 7 billion years old.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope system. Initial observations indicated its unusual trajectory, prompting further analysis that confirmed its extrasolar origin. The comet reached its perihelion on October 29, 2025, where it exhibited significant activity and brightness due to sublimation of ice. Following its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, it has now begun its journey out of the Solar System.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The passage of 3I/ATLAS has mobilized an extensive global network of instruments, allowing us to gather unique data that will be analyzed for years to come.” – A spokesperson from the scientific community.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object confirmed to enter our Solar System, following 1I/’Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. The rarity of such objects provides valuable opportunities to study the composition of materials from outside our Solar System, enhancing our understanding of cosmic formation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze the data collected during the comet's visit. This ongoing analysis aims to improve theoretical models related to interstellar objects and to expand knowledge about the chemical diversity found in interstellar space.</p>
