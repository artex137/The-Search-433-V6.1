      <h2>Gigantic interstellar 3I/ATLAS comet accelerates and turns blue near Sun, scientists say</h2>

<p>A massive comet known as 3I/ATLAS has shown signs of "non-gravitational acceleration" and has turned blue as it passed near the Sun, according to a report from Avi Loeb, Baird Professor of Science and Institute Director at Harvard University. The comet reached its closest approach to the Sun on October 30, 2023, at a distance of about 130 million miles (210 million km).</p>

<p>This observation is significant as it could indicate that 3I/ATLAS will lose half of its mass and produce a massive debris plume in the coming months. NASA and other space agencies, including the European Space Agency (ESA), are tracking the comet using spacecraft, as Earth-based telescopes cannot observe it due to its position behind the Sun. The comet is expected to reappear in early December, which will allow for ground-based observations.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS closest approach to the Sun: October 30, 2023</li>
    <li>Distance from the Sun at closest approach: 130 million miles (210 million km)</li>
    <li>Expected closest pass to Earth: December 19, 2023, at about 167 million miles</li>
    <li>Next observations by ESA's Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (Juice): November 2 and November 25, 2023</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first discovered over the summer of 2023 as it traveled through the solar system. NASA indicated signs of non-gravitational acceleration before the comet's closest approach to the Sun on October 30. The comet's unique blue coloration has raised questions among scientists, prompting ongoing observations.</p>

<p>As it approaches Earth, 3I/ATLAS is expected to provide insights into its composition. The ESA plans to conduct further observations with its Juice spacecraft on November 2 and November 25, 2023.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“@NASA's observations show that this is the third interstellar comet to pass through our solar system. No aliens. No threat to life here on Earth,” said NASA Acting Administrator Sean Duffy in response to a question from Kim Kardashian.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The blue color of 3I/ATLAS is surprising for a natural comet, as dust typically gives comets a redder appearance. Loeb's report suggests that this color could result from significant evaporation or be a signature of ionized carbon monoxide. The phenomenon has led to discussions about whether the comet might possess an internal engine or artificial light source.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will monitor 3I/ATLAS closely as it reappears in December to determine whether the comet will display signs of mass loss and to clarify its classification as a comet or an artificial object.</p>
