      <h2>Gigantic interstellar 3I/ATLAS comet accelerates and turns blue near Sun, scientists say</h2>

<p>A massive comet known as 3I/ATLAS has shown signs of "non-gravitational acceleration" and has appeared to turn blue as it passed the Sun, according to scientists. The comet, first discovered in the summer, reached its closest point to the Sun on October 30, 2023, at approximately 130 million miles (210 million km) from the star.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it could provide insights into the nature of interstellar objects. NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) have been tracking 3I/ATLAS with spacecraft while it is obscured from Earth-based telescopes by the Sun. Observations are expected to resume in early December when the comet becomes visible again.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in summer 2023.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun occurred on October 30, 2023.</li>
    <li>Distance from the Sun at closest approach: 130 million miles (210 million km).</li>
    <li>Expected closest pass to Earth on December 19, 2023, at about 167 million miles away.</li>
    <li>NASA and ESA are tracking the comet using spacecraft.</li>
    <li>Next observations by ESA’s Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (Juice) scheduled for November 2 and November 25, 2023.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first identified during the summer of 2023. It made its closest approach to the Sun on October 30, 2023. Following this event, observations using spacecraft by NASA and ESA have continued while the comet is hidden from view on Earth.</p>
<p>The comet is expected to reappear in early December 2023, allowing for ground-based observations. Its closest approach to Earth is anticipated on December 19, 2023.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “@NASA's observations show that this is the third interstellar comet to pass through our solar system,” said NASA Acting Administrator Sean Duffy in response to a question from Kim Kardashian. “No aliens. No threat to life here on Earth.”
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS adds to the growing list of interstellar objects observed in our solar system. Previous encounters have sparked interest in the characteristics and origins of such objects.</p>
<p>Avi Loeb, Baird Professor of Science and Institute Director at Harvard University, noted that the blue color of the comet is surprising for a natural comet, suggesting it could indicate an unusual phenomenon or characteristic.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it becomes visible again in December. Observations will help determine whether the object is indeed a comet or could be of artificial origin.</p>
