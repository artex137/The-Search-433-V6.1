      <h2>Study Ranks States by Alien Abduction Odds</h2>

<p>A new study has ranked U.S. states by the odds of alien abduction, with New Hampshire taking the top spot. The study, conducted by Canada Sports Betting, analyzed cases from the National UFO Reporting Center between 2019 and 2024. It focused on reports that included "abduction-related details" such as missing time and physical contact.</p>

<p>This study highlights public interest in UFO phenomena and the perceived risks associated with alien encounters. Authorities and researchers have taken note of the findings, which could influence future investigations into UFO sightings and related claims.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Study period: 2019 to 2024</li>
    <li>Top-ranked state: New Hampshire</li>
    <li>Other top states: Idaho, Vermont, Maine, Oregon</li>
    <li>Wyoming: 8th place, with over 25% of UFO reports tied to abduction experiences</li>
    <li>Lowest-ranked states: Minnesota, Mississippi, Nebraska, Indiana, New Mexico</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>

<p>The study was released recently by Canada Sports Betting. It compiled and analyzed data from the National UFO Reporting Center, focusing on reports that detailed abduction experiences. The rankings were determined based on the frequency of UFO sightings relative to the population of each state.</p>

<p>The findings are part of a broader exploration of unusual phenomena, following a previous study on Bigfoot sightings released in October 2022.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>

<blockquote>“This project provides a unique lens on how people perceive the possibility of alien encounters,” said a representative from Canada Sports Betting.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>

<p>Interest in UFOs and potential alien encounters has grown in recent years, with numerous reports and studies capturing public attention. The National UFO Reporting Center has documented thousands of sightings, contributing to ongoing debates about extraterrestrial life.</p>

<p>Previous research has also touched on the cultural significance of UFOs, influencing both media and public discourse surrounding the topic.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>

<p>The study may prompt further investigations into UFO reports and their implications for public safety and awareness regarding potential abduction scenarios.</p>
