      <h2>Private Company Admits It Was Behind New Jersey’s UFO Panic</h2>

<p>A private defense contractor has admitted responsibility for a series of unexplained drone sightings that alarmed residents across New Jersey between November and mid-December 2024. The contractor revealed its involvement during a panel discussion at the Army’s Unmanned Aircraft Systems and Launched Effects Summit in August 2025, according to a report by the New York Post. There were no injuries or fatalities reported during the incidents.</p>

<p>The drone sightings raised concerns among local law enforcement and lawmakers at both the state and federal levels, with some fearing the aircraft could be linked to foreign entities or unidentified aerial phenomena. The White House previously stated that the drones were operated by private companies and posed no threat, but offered few details. The recent admission clarifies the source of the sightings, confirming suspicions that they were related to U.S.-based testing operations rather than foreign surveillance.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Time of sightings: November to mid-December 2024</li>
    <li>Location: New Jersey, including areas near Picatinny Arsenal Army base</li>
    <li>Event discussed: Army’s Unmanned Aircraft Systems and Launched Effects Summit, August 2025</li>
    <li>Aircraft involved: 20-foot aircraft with four wings</li>
    <li>Testing purpose: Performance and maneuverability tests for a government contract</li>
    <li>Official responses: Neither the U.S. Army nor the Department of Defense has commented</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Between November and mid-December 2024, hundreds of New Jersey residents reported seeing unusual lights and drones. Local police departments received numerous calls regarding the sightings, which coincided with activities near sensitive military installations.</p>

<p>In August 2025, during the Army’s summit in Fort Rucker, Alabama, an employee of the unnamed defense contractor publicly acknowledged the company's role in the sightings, stating, “You remember that big UFO scare in New Jersey last year? Well, that was us.”</p>

<p>Following the contractor's admission, concerns have emerged regarding the lack of public notice for such large-scale tests over populated areas.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “You remember that big UFO scare in New Jersey last year? Well, that was us,” an unnamed employee of the contractor reportedly told the New York Post during the Army summit.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The incidents have sparked discussions about public transparency and the rapid expansion of drone technology. Previous sightings in other regions have raised similar concerns about the testing of unmanned or experimental aircraft in civilian airspace. Experts warn that without clear communication, confusion and public alarm could arise again.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>While the contractor's admission has provided clarity, questions remain about future testing protocols and communication strategies between private companies and the public. Investigations may be necessary to ensure safety and transparency in aerial operations moving forward.</p>
