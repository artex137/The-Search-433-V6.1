      <h2>New findings on 'potentially hostile alien threat' hurtling through solar system leave NASA shocked</h2>

<p>A comet named 3I/ATLAS has been identified as an interstellar visitor, surprising NASA scientists after its discovery on July 1 by the ATLAS (Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System) survey telescope. The comet's characteristics have raised questions about its origins and composition, although it has been deemed unlikely to be of alien origin.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it marks only the third object known to have entered our solar system from another star, following 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. NASA continues to study the comet's movements and properties, which may provide insights into the early conditions of our solar system and the formation of celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered on July 1, 2023.</li>
    <li>Identified by the ATLAS survey telescope.</li>
    <li>Third known interstellar object in our solar system.</li>
    <li>Previous interstellar objects: 1I/'Oumuamua (2017) and 2I/Borisov (2019).</li>
    <li>Observations conducted using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRspec).</li>
    <li>Comet exhibits high levels of carbon dioxide, suggesting a unique formation history.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2023, astronomers discovered comet 3I/ATLAS through the ATLAS survey telescope. Initial observations led experts to speculate about its potential alien origins. However, further studies using the JWST revealed its true nature as a comet, providing data on its chemical makeup and physical properties.</p>

<p>As the comet approaches the sun, it undergoes a process called outgassing, which has resulted in the emission of gases such as carbon dioxide, water, and carbonyl sulfide. These findings highlight the comet's unique characteristics and its potential to inform scientists about early solar system conditions.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“While it turns out that the comet is very unlikely to be alien, it remains mysterious as NASA continues to study its movements and make discoveries,” said Professor Avi Loeb of Harvard University.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is part of a growing list of interstellar objects that challenge our understanding of the cosmos. The previous discoveries of 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov have already reshaped theories about the origins and characteristics of celestial bodies. The ongoing research into 3I/ATLAS may further elucidate how these objects are formed and how they interact with our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and astronomers will continue to monitor and study 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the sun. Further observations will aim to clarify its physical properties and origins, potentially leading to new insights about the formation of our solar system.</p>
