      <h2>UFO over a nuclear power plant in the US</h2>

<p>Police officers have recorded an unidentified flying object (UFO) over the Prairie Island Nuclear Power Plant in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on an unspecified date. The object, which had six glowing rings surrounding it, was reported to be hovering at an altitude of 3,048 metres and moved at both slow and hypersonic speeds without making any sound. There were no reported injuries or fatalities.</p>

<p>This sighting is significant due to the proximity of the UFO to a nuclear facility, raising concerns among local authorities. Police have confirmed the incident and are investigating further. Alejandro Rojas, an advisor to Enigma Labs, has indicated that the object may have been misidentified, possibly being the International Space Station (ISS), which has been particularly visible in the area recently.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Location: Prairie Island Nuclear Power Plant, Minneapolis, Minnesota</li>
    <li>Altitude of UFO: 10,000 feet (3,048 metres)</li>
    <li>Number of glowing rings: Six</li>
    <li>Movement: Slow and hypersonic speeds</li>
    <li>Witness: Local police officers</li>
    <li>Near miss: UFO nearly collided with a civilian helicopter</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Police officers on duty observed and filmed the UFO at an unspecified time. The object hovered above the Prairie Island Nuclear Power Plant and exhibited unusual movement patterns. Reports suggest that the ISS has been visible in the area, leading to speculation about the nature of the object.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The object, hovering at an altitude of 10,000 feet, moved at both slow and hypersonic speeds and generated lift without making any sound,” police said.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The ISS has been flying over this area for the past few days and has been very bright. What we see in the video may be the ISS, but we need more details,” stated Alejandro Rojas, advisor to Enigma Labs.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident follows earlier reports of UFO sightings, including mysterious objects above the Popocatépetl volcano in Mexico. The increased frequency of UFO sightings has prompted discussions about aerial phenomena and the need for further investigation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities will continue to investigate the sighting and gather more information to determine the nature of the object. Further analysis of the footage recorded by police may clarify whether the sighting was indeed the ISS or another unidentified object.</p>
