      <h2>Tianwen-1 Captured Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS from a Distance of 30,000,000,000 km</h2>

<p>The Chinese spacecraft Tianwen-1 has successfully observed the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS from a distance of approximately 30 million kilometers, according to the China National Space Administration (CNSA). This observation marks a significant achievement in space exploration, as it represents one of the closest approaches to an interstellar body recorded to date.</p>

<p>This event is crucial for the ongoing Tianwen-1 mission, as it provides valuable technical experience for the upcoming Tianwen-2 mission, which aims to collect samples from a near-Earth asteroid and study a main-belt comet. The data obtained from the observation has revealed clear cometary characteristics of 3I/ATLAS, enhancing our understanding of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Spacecraft: Tianwen-1</li>
    <li>Distance from comet: 30,000,000 km</li>
    <li>Observation date: not disclosed</li>
    <li>Discovered: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Estimated age of 3I/ATLAS: between 3 and 11 billion years</li>
    <li>Mission agency: China National Space Administration (CNSA)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The Tianwen-1 mission has been ongoing since its launch, with the recent observation of 3I/ATLAS marking a key milestone. The comet was discovered on July 1, 2025, and has since been studied by various missions, including the Tianwen-1 spacecraft, which conducted its observation at a significant distance.</p>

<p>This observation is part of a broader program aimed at extending the capabilities and knowledge gained from the Tianwen-1 mission, ultimately preparing for future explorations.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This experiment marks an important milestone in the extended program of Tianwen-1 and serves as valuable technical experience for preparing the Tianwen-2 mission,” the CNSA stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS adds to the growing list of known interstellar objects visiting the Solar System. Scientists believe that such objects provide insight into the formation and evolution of celestial bodies, particularly those originating from ancient stars near the center of the Milky Way.</p>

<p>Prior studies of interstellar objects have highlighted their potential to inform research on exoplanets and the early history of stars, making them significant in the field of astrophysics.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following this observation, the Tianwen-1 mission will continue to process the data obtained from 3I/ATLAS. The insights gained will contribute to the planning and execution of the Tianwen-2 mission, which aims to further explore and study celestial bodies within our Solar System.</p>
