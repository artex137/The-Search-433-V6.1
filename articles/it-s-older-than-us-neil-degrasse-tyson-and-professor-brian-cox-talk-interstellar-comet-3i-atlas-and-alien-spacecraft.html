      <h2>Neil deGrasse Tyson and Brian Cox Discuss Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>American astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson and English physicist Brian Cox have shared insights about interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS during a recent episode of StarTalk. The discussion took place as the comet approaches its closest point to Earth on December 19, 2025, missing the planet by 1.8 astronomical units, or 270 million kilometers.</p>

<p>The conversation highlights the significance of 3I/ATLAS, which may be up to 10 billion years old and has traveled from a distant star system. Tyson and Cox emphasized the importance of accurate scientific communication in light of claims that the comet could be an alien spacecraft. They argued that the comet's ancient origins and unique characteristics are more intriguing than the speculation surrounding extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to Earth:</strong> December 19, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance at Closest Approach:</strong> 1.8 astronomical units (270 million kilometers)</li>
    <li><strong>Estimated Age:</strong> 7 to 10 billion years</li>
    <li><strong>Detection Date:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Detection Agency:</strong> Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, ATLAS detected the comet as it entered the Solar System. Following this discovery, scientists confirmed its interstellar origin and estimated its age. The comet is set to make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, before continuing its journey out of the Solar System.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS is a fascinating thing that current estimates say is maybe 7, 8 billion years old, has come from a distant star system older than our Solar System. An unprecedented opportunity to observe material that's coming from a distant star system,” said Brian Cox.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“If it's an alien spaceship, it's not spending much time [here],” Cox added, referring to the comet's trajectory.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“We're getting a brief glimpse of an ancient object as it passes us by. Isn't that enough to get excited about, without pretending that it's aliens?” Tyson remarked.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Tyson and Cox's discussion comes amid ongoing public interest in astronomical phenomena and the search for extraterrestrial life. The scientific community has often addressed misinformation surrounding such events, emphasizing the need for accurate information to foster public understanding of space exploration.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches its closest point to Earth, astronomers will continue to observe and study the comet to gather data about its composition and trajectory before it exits the Solar System.</p>
