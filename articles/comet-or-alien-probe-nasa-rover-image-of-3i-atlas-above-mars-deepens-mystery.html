      <h2>Comet or alien probe? NASA Rover image of 3I/ATLAS above Mars deepens mystery</h2>

<p>A new image of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has been captured by NASA's Perseverance Rover on October 4, 2025, as it flew past the surface of Mars. The image has reignited debates about the object's origins, with some claiming it is a comet while others suggest it could be an alien probe.</p>

<p>The recent photo has intensified the mystery surrounding 3I/ATLAS, which was first discovered on July 1, 2025. The object appears as a massive cylindrical shape, described as a long, thin, green-coloured stripe. Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has analyzed the rover's photos, suggesting that the shape is not a true cylindrical object but rather an optical illusion caused by the camera's settings as the object moved rapidly across Mars.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of image capture: October 4, 2025</li>
    <li>Discovery date of 3I/ATLAS: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Estimated length of the smear: 31,000 miles</li>
    <li>Estimated width of 3I/ATLAS: 46 kilometers (28 miles)</li>
    <li>Notable analysts: Avi Loeb, Dr. Horace Drew</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025. NASA's Perseverance Rover captured images of the object on October 4, 2025, as it passed over the Martian surface. The images sparked a range of theories about the object's nature and origins.</p>

<p>On October 4, Avi Loeb analyzed the images, arguing that the apparent cylindrical shape is an artifact of the camera's exposure settings. Dr. Horace Drew also weighed in, suggesting the green glow from the object could be due to its nickel coating.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It is not a comet,” declared Dr. Horace Drew in a post on X.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The apparent cylindrical shape of 3I/ATLAS is a smear created by the rover’s camera over-stretching,” said Avi Loeb.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The debates surrounding 3I/ATLAS reflect ongoing discussions in the scientific community about interstellar objects. While some researchers support the idea that it is a comet, others, like Loeb and Drew, propose alternative explanations.</p>

<p>Previous studies have examined the characteristics of interstellar objects, but the unique features of 3I/ATLAS have sparked particular interest and speculation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Avi Loeb is awaiting a new image from the HiRISE camera, which may provide clearer insights into the nature of 3I/ATLAS. Further analysis and observations are expected as scientists continue to investigate this enigmatic object.</p>
