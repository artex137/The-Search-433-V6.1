      <h2>Nasa to Share Photos of Comet Going Viral as Alien</h2>

<p>NASA will share new photos of the interstellar visitor Comet 3I/ATLAS during a live event on November 19 at 3 p.m. EST (1:30 a.m. IST) from the Goddard Space Flight Center. The comet has captured public attention and professional scrutiny due to its unusual characteristics and a theory suggesting it could be an alien probe. There have been no reports of injuries or fatalities related to the comet.</p>

<p>The upcoming event is significant as it will provide insights into Comet 3I/ATLAS, which is only the third confirmed object from outside the galaxy to enter our solar system. NASA has gathered images from various missions as the comet traveled through the inner solar system. The comet's unique properties have sparked discussions among scientists and the public alike.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Event Date:</strong> November 19, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Event Time:</strong> 3 p.m. EST (1:30 a.m. IST)</li>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> Goddard Space Flight Center, USA</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Earth:</strong> At least 170 million miles</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to Mars:</strong> 19 million miles in early October</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2023 by the NASA-funded ATLAS observatory. It has since gained attention due to its distinct physical behaviour, which differs from previously observed comets. The comet's path brought it close to Mars in early October, allowing NASA missions to gather imagery during its journey.</p>

<p>On November 19, NASA will host a live event to share the collected images and insights about the comet's behaviour and characteristics.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist, has suggested that the object's unique properties could indicate non-natural origins, pointing out its unusual tail orientation and the release of nickel without iron.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Elon Musk, during a podcast, noted that while nickel is common in comets and asteroids, the idea of an alien spacecraft is less plausible due to the destructive nature of a nickel-built craft if it were to impact Earth.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable for being the third object confirmed to have entered the solar system from interstellar space. Its unusual characteristics have led to widespread discussions among scientists and the public, particularly around the possibility of non-natural origins.</p>

<p>The comet has drawn comparisons to previous astronomical phenomena that have sparked similar public interest and speculation regarding extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will provide a live stream of the event on various platforms, including NASA+, the NASA app, and YouTube. Members of the public are encouraged to submit questions using #AskNASA, which may be addressed during the live broadcast.</p>
