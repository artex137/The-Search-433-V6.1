      <h2>‘3I/ATLAS Not Just Another Comet’: Harvard’s Avi Loeb Explains What NASA May Be Missing As Mystery Deepens</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist Dr. Avi Loeb has raised questions about the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS after its passage near the Sun on October 29, 2023. The object displayed unusual movement that does not conform strictly to gravitational forces, according to Loeb. His analyses have drawn global attention due to a series of anomalies that challenge conventional understanding of comets.</p>

<p>Loeb has identified 13 anomalies related to 3I/ATLAS, which he believes warrant further investigation. He is particularly concerned about the object's projected encounter with Jupiter on March 16, 2026. The implications of these findings could reshape the understanding of celestial objects and their origins, prompting closer scrutiny from space agencies such as NASA and ESA.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Passage near the Sun: October 29, 2023</li>
    <li>Projected encounter with Jupiter: March 16, 2026</li>
    <li>Number of anomalies identified: 13</li>
    <li>Notable anomaly: Close match with Jupiter’s Hill radius</li>
    <li>Researcher: Dr. Avi Loeb, Harvard astrophysicist</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 29, 2023, 3I/ATLAS swung around the Sun, becoming hidden from Earth-based telescopes. Following its re-emergence, Dr. Loeb began publishing analyses of its movement, noting discrepancies that suggest it may not behave like a typical comet.</p>
<p>Loeb's research has focused on the object's acceleration and brightness patterns, which he believes may indicate engineered features rather than natural characteristics.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The bottom line of my work is that if 3I/ATLAS is a comet, then the diameter of its nucleus must be smaller than a kilometre in order for the mass flux of its population to stay within acceptable bounds." - Dr. Avi Loeb</blockquote>
<blockquote>“If the match persists, it could hint at a technological signature.” - Dr. Avi Loeb</blockquote>
<blockquote>“I do not think that NASA or ESA hold back information. But they do push the narrative that 3I/ATLAS is a familiar comet from a different environment.” - Dr. Avi Loeb</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Dr. Loeb has previously studied interstellar objects, including ʻOumuamua, which exhibited behaviour that did not align with known comet characteristics. The current scrutiny of 3I/ATLAS follows a growing interest in the potential for extraterrestrial technology in celestial phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and ESA are expected to release sharper images of 3I/ATLAS soon. Dr. Loeb plans to analyze these images for signs of unusual jets or acceleration that could provide more insight into the object's nature.</p>
