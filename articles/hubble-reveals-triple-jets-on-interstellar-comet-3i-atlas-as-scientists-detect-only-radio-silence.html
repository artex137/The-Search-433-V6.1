      <h2>Hubble Reveals Triple Jets on Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS as Scientists Detect Only Radio Silence</h2>

<p>In early January 2026, scientists have observed comet 3I/ATLAS, which is currently moving away from the inner solar system, displaying three distinct jets. Discovered by the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile just months prior, 3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar visitor, following 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Researchers have raised questions about the comet's unusual features and the absence of artificial radio signals.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant because it challenges existing theories about the behavior of comets and ignites discussions about the potential for extraterrestrial life. Authorities, including the Breakthrough Listen project and the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), have actively pursued investigations into the comet's characteristics and searched for signs of alien technology.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered by the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile in late 2025.</li>
    <li>Hubble Space Telescope captured images of the comet's jets on November 30, December 12, and December 27, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet was approximately 286 million kilometers from Earth when observed.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS passed at a distance of 1.8 astronomical units (270 million kilometers) from Earth on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>The Solar and Heliospheric Observatory has been observing the comet since November 6, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet shed water at a rate of 3.17×10<sup>29</sup> molecules per second at perihelion.</li>
    <li>No credible artificial signals have been detected from the comet, according to the Breakthrough Listen project.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in late 2025. On November 6, 2025, the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory began monitoring the comet's hydrogen coma. Hubble captured images revealing the triple jets on November 30, December 12, and December 27, 2025. The comet passed Earth at a safe distance on December 19, 2025. The Breakthrough Listen project conducted radio scans on December 18, 2025, finding no signs of artificial signals.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    <p>"The symmetry of the jets raises questions about their origin. While natural explanations exist, we cannot dismiss the possibility of an artificial origin," said Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist leading the analysis.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS follows the discoveries of 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov, both of which prompted investigations into interstellar objects. Previous observations have influenced how scientists respond to new interstellar visitors, emphasizing the importance of coordinated research efforts.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze the extensive datasets collected from Hubble, SOHO, and ground-based observatories. Comet 3I/ATLAS is expected to pass Jupiter in March 2026 before heading into deep interstellar space. The ongoing investigation will help clarify whether the comet's features are the result of natural processes or something unprecedented.</p>
