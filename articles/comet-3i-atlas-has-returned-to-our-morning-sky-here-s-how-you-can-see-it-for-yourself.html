      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS has returned to our morning sky. Here's how you can see it for yourself</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has re-emerged in the northern sky as of mid-November 2025, following its passage behind the Sun. It is currently visible to amateur astronomers using telescopes, according to the NASA-funded Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS).</p>

<p>This comet is significant because it is the third confirmed interstellar object to enter our Solar System. It offers astronomers a unique opportunity to study a celestial body that has traveled from another star system, potentially providing insights into the history of our own Solar System.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, in Río Hurtado, Chile.</li>
    <li>The comet's nucleus measures approximately 5.6 km (3.5 miles) across, with estimates as small as 1.1 km (0.7 miles).</li>
    <li>It is believed to be over 7 billion years old, predating our Solar System.</li>
    <li>As of mid-November 2025, the comet can be found in the constellation Virgo.</li>
    <li>On December 19, 2025, it will be closest to Earth, rising around 23:00.</li>
    <li>It is currently shining at a magnitude of approximately +12.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey telescope. It has since traveled towards the inner Solar System, becoming visible to Earth-based telescopes after its passage behind the Sun in November 2025. As the comet approaches its closest point to Earth on December 19, 2025, it will be monitored closely by astronomers.</p>

<blockquote>“The opportunity to study a comet from another star entirely has astronomers quite giddy with anticipation,” said an unnamed astronomer from the ATLAS project.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable as the third interstellar object observed in our Solar System, following 1I 'Oumuamua in 2017 and comet 2I Borisov in 2019. These observations help scientists understand the formation and evolution of celestial bodies beyond our Solar System.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As Comet 3I/ATLAS continues its journey, astronomers will track its trajectory and composition, providing updates on its visibility and characteristics as it moves through the night sky.</p>
