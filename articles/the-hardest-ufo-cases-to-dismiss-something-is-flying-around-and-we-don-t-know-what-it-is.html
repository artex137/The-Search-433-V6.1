      <h2>The Hardest UFO Cases to Dismiss: Something Is Flying Around and We Don’t Know What It Is</h2>

<p>Filmmaker James Fox has discussed the increasing visibility of unidentified flying objects (UFOs), now referred to as unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs), during an episode of the Michael Shermer Show. Fox’s work has brought UAPs into the spotlight, featuring in congressional hearings, radar logs, and sworn testimonies over the past three decades.</p>

<p>This discussion is significant as it highlights the ongoing shift in how authorities and the public perceive unidentified aerial phenomena. Fox argues that with the weight of evidence gathered from interviews with fighter pilots, radar operators, intelligence officials, and scientists, the narrative surrounding UAPs is changing. He asserts that the previous approach of dismissing these sightings is no longer viable.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>James Fox has spent over 30 years documenting UAP cases.</li>
    <li>Approximately 90 to 95 percent of UAP sightings remain unexplained, according to Fox.</li>
    <li>Fox has interviewed various professionals, including fighter pilots and intelligence officials.</li>
    <li>The discussion took place on the Michael Shermer Show, a platform focused on critical thinking and skepticism.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Over the last three decades, James Fox has conducted extensive interviews with individuals who have firsthand experience with UAPs. His work has contributed to a growing body of evidence that has led to increased interest and scrutiny from both the public and government officials.</p>

<p>In recent years, UAPs have been the subject of congressional hearings, where various military personnel have shared their experiences and observations. This has marked a significant shift in the narrative surrounding these phenomena.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The conclusion is not that we know what these objects are, but that dismissing them no longer works,” Fox stated during the episode.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The conversation around UAPs has gained traction as more individuals come forward with their experiences. The rise in documented sightings and official acknowledgment of these phenomena signals a potential shift in policy and public understanding. Historically, UAPs have often been relegated to the realm of conspiracy theories and tabloid headlines.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As interest in UAPs continues to grow, further investigations and discussions are likely to take place. Authorities may develop new policies to address these phenomena more seriously, and additional testimonies from military and civilian witnesses may emerge.</p>
