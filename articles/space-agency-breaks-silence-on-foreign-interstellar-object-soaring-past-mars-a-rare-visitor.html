      <h2>Space agency breaks silence on 'foreign' interstellar object soaring past Mars: 'A rare visitor'</h2>

<p>The European Space Agency (ESA) has shared new details about the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS following its closest approach to Mars on October 3, 2023. The comet came within 18.6 million miles of the Red Planet, prompting NASA to release images captured by its Perseverance rover. ESA had initially remained quiet until now, providing images from its ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO).</p>

<p>This observation is significant as 3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar comet ever observed, following 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. ESA has called it a "rare visitor," highlighting its importance in understanding the formation of celestial bodies beyond our Solar System.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS approached Mars on October 3, 2023.</li>
    <li>The object came within 18.6 million miles of Mars.</li>
    <li>ESA's ExoMars TGO captured images of 3I/ATLAS.</li>
    <li>The comet's coma spans thousands of miles but its nucleus could not be distinguished.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is estimated to have a diameter of over 28 miles.</li>
    <li>NASA's Perseverance rover also captured images of the comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 3, 2023, 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to Mars, prompting NASA to release images from its Perseverance rover. ESA followed days later, providing images captured by its ExoMars TGO. These images show a tiny, blurry dot, with the visible coma indicating the comet is heating up as it approaches the sun.</p>

<p>NASA and ESA both faced challenges in capturing clear images of 3I/ATLAS due to its distance and faintness. The TGO's CaSSIS camera was unable to distinguish the comet's nucleus from its coma, which is common for distant comets.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “This was a very challenging observation for the instrument,” said Nick Thomas, principal investigator of the CaSSIS camera.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “These comets are absolutely foreign,” the ESA stated, referring to 3I/ATLAS as a “rare visitor.”
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is significant as it provides insights into the formation of worlds beyond our Solar System. Previous interstellar comets, such as 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have also generated interest among scientists. The study of these objects helps researchers understand the origins of celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA is expected to release additional images taken by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter's HiRISE camera, which may provide clearer views of 3I/ATLAS. Further analysis of the comet's characteristics will continue as it approaches the sun.</p>
