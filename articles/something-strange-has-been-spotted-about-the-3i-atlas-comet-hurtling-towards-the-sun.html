      <h2>Something strange has been spotted about the 3I/Atlas comet hurtling towards the sun</h2>

<p>Astronomers have captured the first images of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which is currently hurtling towards the sun at a speed of 130,000 mph. The comet was discovered in July 2025 and is expected to pass close to the sun in October 2025. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as 3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar comet ever recorded. Scientists working with the James Webb Space Telescope aim to learn more about this rare object and its unique characteristics. The comet's unusual trajectory and physical properties provide researchers with a valuable opportunity to study its origins and composition.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered in July 2025.</li>
    <li>Currently traveling at 130,000 mph.</li>
    <li>Estimated size: approximately 3.5 miles wide.</li>
    <li>Expected to pass near the sun in October 2025.</li>
    <li>Comet has developed a carbon dioxide atmosphere, or coma.</li>
    <li>Estimated to be around 3 billion years older than the solar system.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, astronomers discovered comet 3I/ATLAS. Since then, scientists have used the James Webb Space Telescope to capture images and analyze the comet's physical properties. The comet's trajectory has been noted as unusually flat and straight, suggesting it has traveled for billions of years.</p>

<p>As researchers continue to study the comet, they have found evidence that it likely formed near the CO2 ice line of its parent protoplanetary disk. This has led to the development of a carbon dioxide atmosphere around the comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Our observations are compatible with an intrinsically CO2-rich nucleus, which may indicate that 3I/ATLAS contains ices exposed to higher levels of radiation than Solar System comets,” researchers stated.</blockquote>

<blockquote>David Jewett, a scientist at the Hubble observations, noted, “It’s like glimpsing a rifle bullet for a thousandth of a second. You can’t project that back with any accuracy to figure out where it started on its path.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar comet confirmed by astronomers, following previous discoveries that have provided insights into the origins of such celestial bodies. The study of interstellar comets contributes to the understanding of the formation and evolution of our solar system and others.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to observe comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the sun in October 2025. Further studies will focus on its composition and trajectory to gain insights into its origins and the conditions of its formation.</p>
