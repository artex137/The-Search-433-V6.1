      <h2>Approach of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS to Earth intensifies green glow in December</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS will reach its closest point to Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of approximately 270 million kilometers. The comet has exhibited a notable increase in brightness and a characteristic greenish hue, as reported by NASA. This increase follows the comet's perihelion passage in October 2025, when it was closest to the Sun.</p>

<p>This event presents a unique opportunity for scientists to study the composition and behavior of interstellar objects. The intensified green glow of the comet, attributed to the presence of diatomic carbon, has intrigued astronomers and led to further monitoring efforts by various space agencies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest distance will be approximately 270 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>Brightened to a green hue due to diatomic carbon emissions.</li>
    <li>Comet travels at speeds exceeding 200,000 kilometers per hour.</li>
    <li>Discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS system in Chile.</li>
    <li>Estimated core diameter between 440 meters and 5.6 kilometers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2025, while located 6.4 astronomical units from the Sun. Observations conducted by the Gemini South telescope in August and September 2025 did not reveal the current green emissions. The comet reached its perihelion on October 29, 2025, at a distance of 1.4 astronomical units from the Sun, which led to a significant increase in its activity.</p>

<p>Following this, the comet's coma has expanded, and its brightness has intensified, particularly noted in images captured on November 26, 2025, by the Gemini North telescope in Hawaii. As it approaches Earth, astronomers are closely monitoring its activity for potential new outbursts.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The green tone of the 3I/ATLAS coma is the result of the presence of diatomic carbon, which emits light in the green range when excited by solar radiation,” said a NASA spokesperson.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“We are observing the comet’s activity closely, as many comets exhibit delayed responses to solar heat, and we anticipate potential bursts of material,” an astronomer from the European Space Agency noted.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object to originate from outside our Solar System, following ‘Oumuamua and Borisov. Unlike its predecessors, 3I/ATLAS has a wide coma and well-defined dust and ion tails, making it a unique subject for scientific study. Its chemical composition suggests it may have formed in extremely cold environments, potentially providing insights into planet formation conditions in other star systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Ongoing observations coordinated by NASA, the European Space Agency, and various ground-based observatories will continue until 2026. Researchers will analyze data to better understand the comet's molecular structure and evolution.</p>
