      <h2>Comet 3I/Atlas Escapes the Sun’s Gravity</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/Atlas has traveled through our solar system at an extraordinary speed of 57 km/s, according to reports from Fatos Desconhecidos. This speed has ensured its escape from the Sun’s gravitational pull, demonstrating the limits of our star's gravity.</p>

<p>This phenomenon is significant as it highlights the dynamics of interstellar objects and the forces exerted by celestial bodies. Astronomers are examining 3I/Atlas to better understand its trajectory and the implications for future observations of similar objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> 57 km/s</li>
    <li><strong>Comparison:</strong> Faster than 'Oumuamua (26 km/s) and Borisov (33 km/s)</li>
    <li><strong>Solar gravity:</strong> 28 times greater than Earth's</li>
    <li><strong>Distance:</strong> Can attract objects from 3.8 light-years away</li>
    <li><strong>Interstellar objects:</strong> Believed to have been expelled from their parent stars</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas has been identified as an interstellar visitor that entered our solar system at high velocity. The comet's speed has rendered it incapable of being captured by the Sun's gravity, which typically serves to deflect such objects.</p>
<p>In 2017, 'Oumuamua was the first interstellar object detected, traveling at 26 km/s. Comet Borisov followed, reaching a speed of 33 km/s. The recent observations of 3I/Atlas have surpassed these speeds, raising questions about the nature of these celestial travelers.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The Sun’s gravity is powerful but not enough to trap a traveler arriving at escape velocity," according to experts from Fatos Desconhecidos.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interstellar objects like 3I/Atlas and 'Oumuamua have intrigued scientists due to their origins and high speeds. The scientific community has proposed various theories regarding their nature, including the controversial idea that 'Oumuamua may have been an artificial object.</p>
<p>These discussions highlight the ongoing exploration of the cosmos and the mysteries that interstellar objects present to astronomers.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to study 3I/Atlas and similar objects to gain further insights into their compositions and behaviors as they traverse our solar system.</p>
