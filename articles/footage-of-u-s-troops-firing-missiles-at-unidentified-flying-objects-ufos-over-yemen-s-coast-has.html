      <h2>Footage of U.S. Troops Firing Missiles at UFOs Released</h2>

<p>Footage showing U.S. troops firing missiles at unidentified flying objects (UFOs) over Yemen's coast has been released. The video, which lasts approximately 50 seconds, depicts an MQ-9 drone tracking glowing spheres, with one missile believed to be an AGM-114 Hellfire missile being fired at the object on October 30, 2022. The object reportedly continued flying despite being struck.</p>

<p>This footage has raised questions about the nature of unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) and the U.S. government's transparency regarding such incidents. U.S. Representative Eric Burison, who released the video, has called for more access to information related to UAPs, emphasizing the need for public awareness and scrutiny.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Video recorded on October 30, 2022.</li>
    <li>Location: Off the coast of Yemen.</li>
    <li>Type of missile used: AGM-114 Hellfire missile.</li>
    <li>Released by U.S. Representative Eric Burison.</li>
    <li>Witness testimonies from two U.S. Air Force veterans.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 30, 2022, an MQ-9 drone was deployed to track unidentified flying objects off the coast of Yemen. The drone fired a missile at one of the objects, which continued to fly without exploding upon impact. The video was later presented at a House of Representatives task force hearing.</p>

<p>On November 11, 2023, U.S. Representative Eric Burison released the footage, stating it was shared by a whistleblower. Burison highlighted the need for transparency regarding UAPs, questioning why information has been withheld from the public.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "The sphere kept moving and the debris seemed to be being dragged together," Burison said. "I'm not going to guess what it is, but the question is why are we being blocked from accessing this information?"
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "Even though the Hellfire missile hit, it appeared that the object bounced off," said UFO expert George Nap. "The public has the right to see such video data."
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "This video was informed by a whistleblower and is under independent review," Burison added. "We decided to release the video to ensure transparency in the U.S. government regarding the Unconfirmed Flight (UAP)."
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident marks the first known attack by an MQ-9 Reaper drone on an aerial target classified as a UFO in an operational context. The U.S. government has faced increasing pressure to disclose information about UAPs, especially following multiple reports of military encounters with unidentified objects.</p>

<p>During the same hearing, two U.S. Air Force veterans shared their experiences with UAPs, highlighting a growing interest in the phenomenon and calls for accountability regarding military encounters.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the incident and the footage are ongoing. U.S. authorities are expected to review the video further and provide additional information as it becomes available. The push for transparency regarding UAPs is likely to continue in Congress.</p>
