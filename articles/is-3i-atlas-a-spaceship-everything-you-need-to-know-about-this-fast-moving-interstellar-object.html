      <h2>Is 3I/ATLAS a spaceship? Everything you need to know about this fast-moving interstellar object</h2>

<p>3I/ATLAS, a potentially billions-year-old icy celestial comet, has been moving through our solar system since its discovery in July. The Manhattan-sized interstellar object has exhibited peculiar characteristics, prompting speculation about its origin. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in relation to the comet.</p>

<p>This matter has gained attention as astronomers and scientists investigate the object’s unusual features. Authorities, including astronomers from Harvard, are examining the comet to determine if it could be of alien origin, or if it is merely a large rock in space.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered: July 2023</li>
    <li>Size: Comparable to Manhattan</li>
    <li>Age: Potentially billions of years old</li>
    <li>Current status: Under investigation by astronomers</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified in July 2023. Since its discovery, it has been observed traveling through the solar system, leading to discussions among scientists regarding its origins and characteristics.</p>

<p>The object has raised questions about its composition and whether it could be classified as something other than a typical comet, with some experts suggesting it may have extraterrestrial origins.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We are looking closely at the characteristics of this object to understand what it really is,” said a Harvard astronomer, expressing skepticism about its classification as just a rock in space.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is not the first time a celestial object has sparked debate about its origins. Previous interstellar objects have also prompted discussions among astronomers regarding their nature and the possibility of extraterrestrial life. The interest in 3I/ATLAS aligns with ongoing research in the field of astrobiology.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS and conduct further investigations to determine its composition and origin. No specific timelines for upcoming studies have been disclosed.</p>
