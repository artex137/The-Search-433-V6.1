      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS spews water like fire hose, leaking 40 kilograms per second: Study</h2>

<p>NASA’s Swift Observatory has identified interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS releasing water at a remarkable rate of nearly 40 kilograms per second, according to a study published in the Astrophysical Journal Letters. The comet was approximately 2.9 times farther from the sun than Earth between July and August 2025.</p>

<p>This discovery provides significant insights into early planet formation beyond the solar system. Researchers suggest that the intense water outflow may originate from icy debris surrounding the comet rather than its surface. The findings challenge existing theories about the formation of comets and planets around stars.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS releases water at a rate of 40 kilograms per second.</li>
    <li>The comet was detected between July and August 2025.</li>
    <li>It was located 2.9 times farther from the sun than Earth.</li>
    <li>The study was published in the Astrophysical Journal Letters last month.</li>
    <li>NASA’s Swift Observatory made the discovery.</li>
    <li>Observations from Gemini South and NASA’s Infrared Telescope Facility contributed to the findings.</li>
    <li>The European Space Agency’s Mars orbiters spotted the comet in early October.</li>
    <li>The Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) will track the comet in November 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Between July and August 2025, NASA’s Swift Observatory detected the ultraviolet signature of hydroxyl, a chemical product of water molecules, from comet 3I/ATLAS. This indicated the comet's substantial water loss at a significant distance from the sun.</p>
<p>In early October 2025, the European Space Agency’s Mars orbiters observed 3I/ATLAS. The comet is scheduled to be monitored by the JUICE mission in November 2025, which aims to provide further insights into its activity.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“When we detect water — or even its faint ultraviolet echo, OH — from an interstellar comet, we’re reading a note from another planetary system,” said Dennis Bodewits, a physics professor at Auburn University.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Every interstellar comet so far has been a surprise,” said Zexi Xing, postdoctoral researcher at Auburn University and lead author of the study. “Each one is rewriting what we thought we knew about how planets and comets form around stars.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The study's findings build on previous observations of interstellar comets. Comet ‘Oumuamua was noted for being dry, while Comet Borisov contained high levels of carbon monoxide. Each discovery has contributed to a shifting understanding of the chemical compositions of comets from different planetary systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The JUICE mission will observe 3I/ATLAS in November 2025, capturing the comet near its closest approach to the sun. Data from this mission is expected to arrive in February 2026 due to communication constraints.</p>
