      <h2>Police helicopter ‘targeted’ by UFOs over US base in England: Report</h2>

<p>A National Police Air Service EC135 helicopter was reportedly “targeted” by two unidentified flying objects (UFOs) over RAF Lakenheath, the largest U.S. Air Force base in Europe, in November 2024. The incident, which involved no injuries or fatalities, has drawn attention following the release of documents obtained under Britain’s Freedom of Information Act.</p>

<p>This incident matters as it raises questions about aviation safety and the nature of unidentified aerial phenomena in the vicinity of military installations. Authorities are reviewing the reports and have noted that the incident may involve advanced drone technology.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Incident occurred in November 2024.</li>
    <li>Location: RAF Lakenheath, Suffolk, England.</li>
    <li>The helicopter was forced to take emergency evasive action.</li>
    <li>Drones reportedly matched the helicopter's speed of approximately 165 knots.</li>
    <li>Approximately 20 drone sightings reported over RAF bases from November 20-22, 2024.</li>
    <li>Police logs indicated drone activity between 1800-0000 hrs on those dates.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 20-22, 2024, multiple drone sightings were reported near RAF Lakenheath, RAF Feltwell, and RAF Mildenhall. A Suffolk Police log noted around 20 drones flying over these bases during the evenings.</p>
<p>On November 21, 2024, the National Police Air Service EC135 helicopter encountered two unidentified drones that reportedly pursued it, prompting the crew to perform an emergency dive to evade them.</p>
<p>Documents reviewed by The Daily Mail suggest that these drones were not misidentified as an American F-15 fighter jet, contrary to previous claims by a U.K. aviation safety board.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“They were forced to take emergency evasive action in relation to a drone which came within a dangerously close proximity to them,” an incident log filed by Suffolk Police stated.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“In the 30-minute video with pilot audio, nobody mentions F-15s. They only talk about the drones. How they’re basically mirroring the helicopter’s movements,” a military source told The Daily Mail.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident is part of a growing number of reported UFO sightings near military installations in recent years. The increasing frequency of drone activity in restricted airspace has prompted concerns among aviation authorities and military officials regarding safety and security.</p>
<p>Prior incidents have often been dismissed as misidentifications, but this case suggests a more complex interaction may be occurring between drones and aircraft in the area.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities are expected to conduct further investigations into the drone sightings and the incident involving the police helicopter. Future reports may clarify the nature of the drones and their operational parameters.</p>
