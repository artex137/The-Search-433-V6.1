      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Has Tail Facing the Wrong Way</h2>

<p>Astronomers have discovered that the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS possesses a faint, teardrop-shaped tail pointing directly away from the Sun. This finding was detailed by physicist Avi Loeb in an article published on Medium on August 31, 2025. The discovery was made using the Gemini South telescope located atop Cerro Pachón in the Chilean Andes.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it adds to the growing list of anomalies associated with 3I/ATLAS, an object from beyond our Solar System. The observations suggest that the comet's behavior deviates from typical cometary activity, indicating it might represent a new category of interstellar body.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovery published on August 31, 2025, by physicist Avi Loeb.</li>
    <li>Telescope used: Gemini South 8.2-meter telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>Tail length: 56,400 kilometers; oriented southeast.</li>
    <li>Coma diameter: approximately 18,800 kilometers.</li>
    <li>CO₂ emission rate: 130 kilograms per second.</li>
    <li>H₂O emission rate: 6.6 kilograms per second.</li>
    <li>Diameter of 3I/ATLAS estimated at 46 kilometers.</li>
    <li>Perihelion date: October 29, 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Between August 8 and 12, 2025, data from NASA’s SPHEREx mission suggested that 3I/ATLAS could have a diameter of 46 kilometers. The Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS) captured images revealing the comet's tail and coma. The shape of the gas plume was analyzed, indicating a unique sublimation process distinct from typical comets.</p>

<p>In May 2025, NASA’s TESS mission observed a persistent glow around 3I/ATLAS, even when it was six astronomical units from the Sun. This early observation hinted at the object's activity being driven by CO₂ or other low-temperature volatiles.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "A high stress environment elicits confessions" regarding the approaching perihelion of 3I/ATLAS.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is unique not only for its size but also for its trajectory, which aligns closely with the ecliptic plane of our Solar System. This is different from the typical random angles seen in other interstellar objects. The presence of nickel without iron in the outgassing plume is particularly unusual, resembling signatures of industrial alloy production, which are not typically found in natural astrophysical environments.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches perihelion on October 29, 2025, astronomers anticipate that increased solar heat and radiation may reveal more about the object's composition and behavior. Further observations and analyses are expected to provide insights into this interstellar visitor.</p>
