      <h2>Two friends spot mysterious object in Güdül district</h2>
<p>Okan Kılıç and Orhan Öztürk, residents of Adalıkuzu Village in the Güdül district of Ankara, have reported seeing a mysterious object in the sky on the evening of November 8, 2025. The object emitted yellow lights and was described as approximately 100 meters in diameter. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<h2>Authorities are investigating the sighting</h2>
<p>This sighting has drawn attention from local residents and researchers in the field of ufology. Authorities have not disclosed any formal investigation into the incident at this time.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of sighting: November 8, 2025</li>
    <li>Time of sighting: Around 9:00 PM</li>
    <li>Location: Adalıkuzu Village, Güdül district, Ankara</li>
    <li>Witnesses: Okan Kılıç and Orhan Öztürk</li>
    <li>Estimated diameter of the object: 100 meters</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 8, 2025, at approximately 9:00 PM, Kılıç and Öztürk observed yellow lights in the sky while sitting by a fire. Kılıç recorded the lights with his mobile phone after observing the object through binoculars. They noted the presence of smaller objects moving in the vicinity, which appeared to be attracted to the larger object.</p>
<p>The witnesses reported seeing these smaller objects for about two hours, noting that they exhibited unusual movements, which heightened their curiosity.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This object I saw was not Starlink, a satellite, or any UAV, or armed UAV. Because we have seen smaller ones while observing regularly in the evenings. I think this object I saw is a UFO,” said Kılıç.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Around 9:00 PM, we were sitting by the fire and drinking tea. Later, while looking at the sky, we saw flying objects. […] The object I saw was not a drone, a plane, or Starlink; it was probably a UFO,” said Öztürk.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“When we pay attention to the movements of the object, it is impossible for a mass of that size to move that fast. The object exhibits movements that are contrary to the laws of physics,” stated Coşkun Deniz, a social media content creator and ufology researcher.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This sighting is one of several reported in the Güdül district over the past few years. Residents have claimed to observe unidentified flying objects periodically, which has sparked interest among local ufologists.</p>
<p>The average diameter of previously reported UFOs is around 15 meters, making Kılıç and Öztürk's claim of a 100-meter diameter object particularly notable.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities have not announced any plans for further investigation into the sighting. Local residents and ufology enthusiasts may continue to observe the area for similar occurrences in the future.</p>
