      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Continues Its Grand Tour of Our Solar System</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar visitor, has been touring our solar system since its detection in July 2023, captivating astronomers worldwide. The comet, which is currently about 170 million miles from Earth, has generated significant interest due to its rarity as only the third confirmed interstellar object to enter our solar system.</p>

<p>The arrival of Comet 3I/ATLAS has prompted extensive observations and imaging efforts from various space agencies, including NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA). Scientists are eager to analyze its composition and compare it with other celestial bodies from our solar system, as this could provide insights into the building blocks of other star systems.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 3, 2023, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-Impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Rio Hurtado, Chile.</li>
  <li>It is approximately 170 million miles away from Earth as of December 2023.</li>
  <li>NASA's SPHEREx conducted observations from August 7 to August 15, 2023, when the comet was 290 million miles from the sun.</li>
  <li>The comet reached its closest point to the sun at the end of October 2023.</li>
  <li>It will fly by Earth on December 19, 2023, at a safe distance of about 170 million miles.</li>
  <li>Images from ESA's Juice spacecraft revealed the comet has two distinct tails.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 3, 2023, by the ATLAS network. Early observations indicated that it was already 420 million miles away from Earth. Over the following months, various space telescopes and missions began capturing detailed images of the comet.</p>

<p>Significant observations occurred from August 7 to August 15, when NASA's SPHEREx focused on the comet's coma, revealing a composition rich in ice water and carbon dioxide. Late August saw the Gemini South telescope capture detailed images that showed the comet’s increased activity as it approached the sun.</p>

<p>In October, the ESA's ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter and NASA's Hubble Space Telescope provided additional images, revealing the comet's luminous tail and overall structure. The most recent data from ESA's Juice spacecraft, taken during its closest approach on November 4, suggested the presence of two distinct tails.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The observations from SPHEREx indicate that the materials in 3I/ATLAS may not be vastly different from those found in our own solar system,” said a NASA spokesperson.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“This comet represents a unique opportunity to study the chemical signatures of interstellar objects,” stated an ESA representative.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object, following 'Oumuamua' in 2017 and Comet '2I/Borisov' in 2019. The rarity of such objects has spurred extensive research efforts, as they provide a rare glimpse into the materials and conditions of distant star systems.</p>

<p>The interest in 3I/ATLAS reflects a growing trend in astronomy to study interstellar objects, as they challenge existing theories regarding the formation and evolution of celestial bodies across the galaxy.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As Comet 3I/ATLAS continues its journey out of the solar system, scientists will analyze the vast amounts of data collected from various missions. ESA expects to retrieve additional data from the Juice spacecraft in February 2024, which will further enhance understanding of this unique interstellar visitor.</p>
