      <h2>Viktor Hovland Finds Confidence Ahead of Ryder Cup</h2>

<p>Viktor Hovland has expressed renewed confidence in his golf swing after a promising practice session before the 45th Ryder Cup, which is taking place in Farmingdale, N.Y. Hovland, who has struggled with his swing and coaching changes since his last Ryder Cup appearance in 2023, reported a breakthrough during his pre-tournament range time.</p>

<p>This development is significant as Hovland aims to improve his performance at the Ryder Cup, where he previously achieved a 3-1-1 record. His teammate, Ludvig Aberg, remarked on Hovland's habit of discussing topics like UFOs to ease the pressure of competition, indicating a lighthearted approach to the intense atmosphere of the tournament.</p>
