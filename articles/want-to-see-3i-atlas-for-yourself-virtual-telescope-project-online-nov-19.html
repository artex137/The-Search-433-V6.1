      <h2>Want To See 3I/ATLAS For Yourself? Virtual Telescope Project Online Nov. 19</h2>

<p>On November 19, the Virtual Telescope Project will host a livestream event featuring views of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it moves away from the sun. The livestream will start at 11:15 p.m. EST on November 18 (04:15 GMT on November 19) and will showcase images captured by robotic telescopes in Manciano, Italy, weather permitting.</p>

<p>This event allows the public to witness the rare comet, which was discovered on July 1, 2023, and is only the third interstellar object confirmed to have entered our solar system. The comet recently made its closest approach to the sun on October 30, an event known as perihelion, and has only recently become visible again.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Livestream date: November 19, 2023</li>
    <li>Start time: 11:15 p.m. EST (04:15 GMT)</li>
    <li>Location of telescopes: Manciano, Italy</li>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered: July 1, 2023</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the sun: October 30, 2023</li>
    <li>Current brightness magnitude: +10.9</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2023. It was confirmed as an interstellar object based on its trajectory. The comet made its closest approach to the sun on October 30 during perihelion. On November 11, founder Gianluca Masi captured an image of the comet showcasing its central coma and ion tail.</p>
<p>The livestream event, initially scheduled for November 16, was postponed due to poor weather conditions. The public can now view the comet on November 19 if weather permits.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The event will feature live views of comet 3I/ATLAS captured by our suite of robotic telescopes,” said Gianluca Masi, founder of the Virtual Telescope Project.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable for being only the third interstellar object confirmed to visit our solar system. Its discovery and subsequent observations contribute to the understanding of celestial bodies originating from outside our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The Virtual Telescope Project will continue to monitor comet 3I/ATLAS as it travels through the constellation Virgo. The livestream will provide an opportunity for the public to engage with this significant astronomical event.</p>
