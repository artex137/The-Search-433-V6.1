      <h2>What Does the I in Comet 3I/ATLAS Stand For? Frequently Asked Questions Answered</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey telescope, marks the third confirmed interstellar object in history. It is currently located approximately 3.5 astronomical units (AU) from Earth, moving at a speed of about 61 km/s.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it provides scientists with a rare opportunity to study an object that has traveled through the galaxy for billions of years. Authorities, including astronomers and researchers, are actively monitoring its trajectory and composition to gain insights into the early solar system and the conditions of distant star nurseries.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovery date: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth: 3.5 AU</li>
    <li>Speed: 61 km/s</li>
    <li>Designation: 3I/ATLAS (third interstellar object by ATLAS)</li>
    <li>Composition: Carbon dioxide, hydrogen cyanide, atomic nickel</li>
    <li>Best viewing window: November 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the ATLAS survey telescope discovered Comet 3I/ATLAS. The comet's hyperbolic trajectory confirms it is a one-time visitor to the inner solar system, set to return to the galaxy after its flyby.</p>
<p>In August 2025, the Gemini South telescope imaged the comet's coma, revealing its chemical composition. NASA's Swift Observatory also detected hydroxyl, providing the first clear water signature seen in an interstellar object.</p>
<p>The best opportunity for observation will occur in November 2025, when the comet will be visible in the pre-dawn sky from certain locations.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS is a messenger from the void between the stars. It allows us to sample alien chemistry using Earth-bound tools,” said an astronomer involved in the study. “This flyby is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I/ATLAS, only two interstellar objects have been confirmed: 1I/'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. The study of these objects has provided valuable insights into the composition of materials from outside our solar system.</p>
<p>The designation 'I' for 3I/ATLAS is significant, as it indicates a hyperbolic trajectory, confirming its extra-solar origin. This distinguishes it from other comets and asteroids that are gravitationally bound to the Sun.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As Comet 3I/ATLAS continues its journey, astronomers will conduct ongoing observations and analyses to better understand its composition and origins. The comet's flyby will conclude as it exits the inner solar system, never to return.</p>
