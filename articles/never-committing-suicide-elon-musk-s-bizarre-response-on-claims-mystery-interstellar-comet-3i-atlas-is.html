      <h2>'Never committing suicide': Elon Musk's bizarre response on claims mystery interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is</h2>

<p>Tech billionaire Elon Musk has commented on the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS during an episode of The Joe Rogan Experience, emphasizing his commitment to transparency regarding potential evidence of extraterrestrial life. The comet, which is the third known object from outside our solar system detected by NASA, has sparked significant interest among scientists and the public alike.</p>

<p>This discussion comes amid ongoing scientific intrigue surrounding the comet's unusual trajectory and composition. Authorities, including NASA, have stated that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth, despite some speculation about its origins and behavior.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS detected by NASA's Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in early July.</li>
    <li>Size comparable to the city of Manhattan.</li>
    <li>Nickel vapour detected in the comet's gas cloud.</li>
    <li>Musk has publicly stated he would reveal evidence of aliens if he had it.</li>
    <li>Nasa's Acting Administrator Sean Duffy confirmed there are no aliens or threats associated with the comet.</li>
    <li>Harvard physicist Avi Loeb estimates a 30 to 40 percent chance the comet may not be naturally formed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In early July, NASA's ATLAS team first identified comet 3I/ATLAS using the Hubble Space Telescope. The comet's unique characteristics, including its rapid speed and unusual composition, have piqued the interest of astronomers worldwide. On a recent episode of The Joe Rogan Experience, Elon Musk discussed the comet and its potential implications, including the presence of nickel and the possibility of extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “I would never take my own life. Joe, you have my word that I will come on your show and reveal it,” Musk said, referring to possible evidence of aliens.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “There are no aliens and no threat to life here on Earth,” said NASA's Acting Administrator Sean Duffy.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object to pass through the solar system, following 1I/2017 U1 and 2I/Borisov. Its detection has reignited debates around the existence of extraterrestrial life and the origins of such celestial objects. Scientists, including Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb, have raised questions about the comet's unusual behavior, suggesting it might indicate non-natural origins, although many experts attribute these anomalies to natural processes.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA continues to monitor comet 3I/ATLAS and has assured the public of no imminent threat. Ongoing studies aim to further understand the comet's composition and trajectory, while debates surrounding its origins and implications for extraterrestrial life are likely to continue among scientists and the public.</p>
