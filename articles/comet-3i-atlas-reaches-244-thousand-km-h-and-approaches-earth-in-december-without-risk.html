      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS reaches 244 thousand km/h and approaches Earth in December without risk</h2>

<p>NASA has confirmed that comet 3I/ATLAS, discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile, is approaching Earth in December 2025 at a speed of approximately <strong>244 thousand km/h</strong>. The comet will reach a minimum distance of <strong>270 million km</strong> from Earth, with no risk of collision.</p>

<p>This event is significant for the scientific community, as the comet's unusual composition and hyperbolic orbit provide insights into interstellar chemistry and the origins of celestial bodies. NASA has coordinated observations of the comet with various telescopes and space missions to gather more data and refine orbital calculations.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun (perihelion) on October 29, 2025, at 1.4 astronomical units (210 million km).</li>
    <li>Approaching Earth at a distance of 1.8 astronomical units (270 million km) in December 2025.</li>
    <li>Current speed of 244 thousand km/h; expected to reach 270 thousand km/h near Earth.</li>
    <li>Rich in carbon dioxide with absence of a typical tail.</li>
    <li>International asteroid warning network conducting training for orbital calculations.</li>
    <li>Data collection expected to continue until January 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered by the ATLAS telescope in Chile. On October 29, 2025, it reached perihelion, coming within 1.4 astronomical units of the Sun. Observations began in November 2025, and the comet is expected to return to visibility in December.</p>

<p>The comet's approach to Earth, occurring at a distance of 1.8 astronomical units, poses no risk of collision. The next significant event will be its passage by Jupiter, scheduled for March 2026 at 54 million km.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The study of 3I/ATLAS allows us to advance knowledge about interstellar chemistry,” said a NASA spokesperson. “Its unique composition challenges traditional models of comet formation.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar comet identified, with an estimated age of between <strong>7 and 14 billion years</strong>. Its hyperbolic orbit indicates that it was ejected from another star billions of years ago. The comet's unusual features, including its concentration of carbon dioxide and lack of a visible tail, differentiate it from other comets like 2I/Borisov.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and international observatories will continue monitoring comet 3I/ATLAS until January 2026 to gather more data on its trajectory and composition. The comet will return to visibility in December 2025 using professional equipment only.</p>
