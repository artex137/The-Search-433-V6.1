      <h2>Sharp nucleus and irregular coma: 3I/ATLAS defies comet patterns in solar orbit</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has displayed unusual characteristics during its passage through the solar system, as observed by amateur astronomers and space agencies. Discovered on July 1, 2025, by the Atlas telescope in Chile, the comet has a sharp core and an irregular coma, with no detectable tail in some images. The comet is currently located in the constellation of Virgem and reached perihelion on October 30, 2025, at a distance of 1.4 astronomical units from the Sun.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant because it challenges existing models of comet behavior. Authorities, including NASA and the European Space Agency, are coordinating efforts to analyze the comet's orbit and composition. The unusual features of 3I/ATLAS have reignited debates about its origins and the processes affecting its activity.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered: July 1, 2025, by the Atlas telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>Perihelion reached: October 30, 2025, at 1.4 astronomical units from the Sun.</li>
    <li>Current location: Constellation of Virgem.</li>
    <li>Coma radius: Between 30,000 and 45,000 kilometers.</li>
    <li>Ejected mass: Exceeds 10^9 kilograms of silicate and organic materials.</li>
    <li>Brightness: Current magnitude is 10, visible in amateur telescopes.</li>
    <li>Next observation period: Ongoing until December 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2025. It reached perihelion on October 30, 2025, and was approximately 1.4 astronomical units from the Sun at that time. During its approach, observations from NASA and ESA probes, including Maven, provided close-up details of the comet on October 3, when it was about 29 million kilometers from Mars. Further observations continued into November, with Gemini North telescope confirming its symmetrical coma on November 26.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The sharp nucleus and irregular coma of 3I/ATLAS are unlike any comet we have observed before. This raises questions about its composition and origin,” said an astronomer involved in the study.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous interstellar objects, such as 1I/’Oumuamua, have also shown atypical characteristics, prompting similar discussions regarding their nature. 3I/ATLAS’s composition, which includes a mix of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, is particularly noteworthy as it suggests a volatile composition that diverges from traditional cometary materials.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Ongoing observations and analyses will continue as astronomers aim to refine their models of 3I/ATLAS. Data collection will focus on its anomalous emissions and overall behavior as it moves away from perihelion.</p>
