      <h2>MeerKAT Detects Radio Signal From Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>On November 13, 2025, South Africa's MeerKAT radio array detected the first confirmed radio signal from the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which supports its natural, cometary identity and counters recent speculation about alien origins. The signal features two narrow peaks at 1665 and 1667 MHz, consistent with hydroxyl (OH) absorption resulting from sunlight interacting with water vapor released from the comet.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it provides concrete evidence of 3I/ATLAS being an active, water-bearing comet. Authorities, including the South African Radio Astronomy Observatory (SARAO), have documented the findings in an Astronomer’s Telegram, marking a milestone in the scientific understanding of this interstellar object.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of detection: October 24, 2025</li>
    <li>Location: South Africa’s MeerKAT radio array</li>
    <li>Frequencies detected: 1665 MHz and 1667 MHz</li>
    <li>Close approach to the Sun: October 29–30, 2025</li>
    <li>Minimum distance from Earth: approximately 1.8 AU</li>
    <li>Previous attempts: Two failed attempts in September 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first discovered on July 1, 2025, during the ATLAS survey and was later reclassified as an interstellar comet. Following its discovery, researchers observed its behavior and activity, noting significant water activity as it approached the Sun.</p>
<p>On October 24, 2025, MeerKAT successfully detected the OH absorption lines, confirming the comet's natural composition. The comet reached perihelion around October 29–30, 2025, and is currently reappearing from solar glare for further observations.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "The detection of OH absorption lines provides independent, physics-based evidence that 3I/ATLAS is an active, water-bearing comet," said a representative from the South African Radio Astronomy Observatory.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to this detection, the scientific community had observed unusual water activity from 3I/ATLAS, likening it to a "fire hydrant" as the comet brightened near the Sun. This recent detection aligns with weeks of optical and ultraviolet evidence supporting the comet's activity and composition.</p>
<p>While previous interstellar comet 2I/Borisov yielded marginal OH at radio wavelengths, the MeerKAT detection is the first confirmed radio signal specifically for 3I/ATLAS, marking a notable advancement in the study of interstellar comets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers expect to conduct further L-band observations as the geometry improves. Some have proposed opportunistic listening when 3I/ATLAS passes near Jupiter in March 2026, although this is not an officially announced plan by NASA.</p>
