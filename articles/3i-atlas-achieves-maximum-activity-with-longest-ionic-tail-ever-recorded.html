      <h2>3I/ATLAS achieves maximum activity with longest ionic tail ever recorded</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has displayed its longest and brightest ionic tail since its discovery in July 2025, as observed from the Castelmartini Observatory in Italy on November 25, 2025. This phenomenon occurs as the comet approaches the Sun, leading to an increase in gas release and ionization, according to astronomers.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it confirms the continued activity of 3I/ATLAS as it traverses the Solar System. Observations indicate that the comet's ionic tail, which is pushed away from the Sun by solar wind, has reached unprecedented lengths and brightness, allowing for detailed studies of its composition and behavior.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS system in Chile.</li>
    <li>Current observations show the comet's ionic tail is the longest and brightest recorded to date.</li>
    <li>The comet is currently traveling at a speed exceeding 30 km/s relative to the Sun.</li>
    <li>Observations were conducted using 18 exposures of 120 seconds each.</li>
    <li>The ionic tail appears bluish in long exposure photographs.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is transiting the constellation of Serpentário.</li>
    <li>The comet is expected to leave the Solar System after crossing perihelion in the coming months.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was initially detected on July 1, 2025, marking it as the third interstellar comet identified by humanity. As it approached the Sun, observations began to reveal its unusual characteristics, including the presence of nickel vapor and metallic iron. By November 25, 2025, the comet exhibited its most extensive ionic tail, confirming its high activity level.</p>

<p>The increase in brightness and tail length is attributed to a higher sublimation rate of metallic materials, which occurs as ultraviolet radiation from the Sun ionizes the comet's released gases. This unique activity has provided astronomers with valuable data about the formation of distant planetary systems.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The current structure of 3I/ATLAS surpasses all previous observations in extent and luminosity,” said a spokesperson from the Castelmartini Observatory.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“This is the first interstellar comet with sufficient activity for detailed studies from Earth,” noted astronomers monitoring the comet’s trajectory.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I/ATLAS, only two interstellar comets had been identified, making this discovery noteworthy in the field of astronomy. The unique composition and behavior of 3I/ATLAS provide insights into the formation and evolution of celestial bodies outside our Solar System.</p>

<p>The comet's hyperbolic trajectory indicates it will not be captured by the Sun's gravity, and it is expected to exit the Solar System permanently after its perihelion passage.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS through global telescope networks as it approaches perihelion. Detailed studies will focus on its chemical variations and the implications for understanding distant star systems.</p>
