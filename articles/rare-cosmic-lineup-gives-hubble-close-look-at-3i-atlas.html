      <h2>Rare Cosmic Lineup Gives Hubble Close Look at 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>On January 22, 2026, the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope captured images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it aligned closely with the Sun-Earth axis, revealing unique jet structures and an extended anti-tail. The observations were made at 13:10 UTC and 13:40 UTC from the Shanghai Astronomical Observatory.</p>

<p>This alignment, which occurred at an angle of just 0.69 degrees, allowed for a significant brightness surge, providing astronomers with insights into the comet's composition and structure. Authorities at Hubble and associated institutions are analyzing the data to further understand interstellar materials and their implications.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of observation: January 22, 2026</li>
    <li>Observation times: 13:10 UTC and 13:40 UTC</li>
    <li>Location: Shanghai Astronomical Observatory</li>
    <li>Instrument used: Hubble’s Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3)</li>
    <li>Alignment angle: 0.69 degrees</li>
    <li>Number of jets observed: 4</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On January 22, 2026, Hubble observed 3I/ATLAS during a rare alignment with the Sun and Earth. This alignment provided a unique opportunity to study the comet's jets and anti-tail structures. The observations were processed shortly after the images were captured, leading to insights into the comet's composition.</p>

<p>Professor Abraham Loeb and Dr. Mauro Barbieri, in a paper published in the Research Notes of the American Astronomical Society, highlighted the significance of this observation, noting that previous interstellar objects lacked similar data.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Interstellar objects provide unique opportunities for studying materials from other stellar systems,” said Professor Abraham Loeb.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“This rare alignment resulted in a brightness surge whose magnitude and growth rate are dictated by the composition and structure of the particles shed by jets of 3I/ATLAS,” Professor Loeb explained in a statement.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This observation follows previous studies of interstellar objects, including 1I/Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Unlike those observations, which were limited by their angles relative to the Sun-Earth axis, 3I/ATLAS provided a clearer view of its jets and material composition.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze the data collected from Hubble to gain further insights into the properties of 3I/ATLAS and interstellar materials. The findings may inform future studies of similar celestial bodies.</p>
