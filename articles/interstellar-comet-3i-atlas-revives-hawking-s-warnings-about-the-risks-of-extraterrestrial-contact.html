      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS revives Hawking’s warnings about the risks of extraterrestrial contact</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, detected in July 2025 by the ATLAS telescope in Chile, has crossed the Solar System on a hyperbolic trajectory, confirming its interstellar origin. The comet reached perihelion on October 30, 2025, at a distance of 210 million kilometers from the Sun, but does not pose a threat to Earth, according to NASA and ESA officials.</p>

<p>This event has reignited discussions about the potential dangers of extraterrestrial contact, as warned by physicist Stephen Hawking. Experts have noted the comet's unusual chemical composition, including carbon dioxide and nickel vapor, which raises questions about its origins. NASA has mobilized 12 space missions to monitor the comet as it approaches Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Detected: July 1, 2025, at Río Hurtado, Chile.</li>
    <li>Perihelion reached: October 30, 2025, at 210 million kilometers from the Sun.</li>
    <li>Minimum approach to Earth: 270 million kilometers in December 2025.</li>
    <li>Speed: 60 km/s, indicating billions of years of travel.</li>
    <li>Estimated age: Between 7.6 and 14 billion years.</li>
    <li>Nasa's observation campaign began: November 2025.</li>
    <li>Continued observations: Until January 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2025, during observations at the ATLAS telescope in Chile. Pre-discovery observations were made in June 2025. The comet reached perihelion on October 30, 2025, and is expected to make its closest approach to Earth in December 2025.</p>

<p>In November 2025, NASA initiated a campaign involving 12 space missions to closely monitor the comet's trajectory and chemical composition. Observations from various telescopes have revealed significant details about the comet, including its unusual reddish color and the presence of organic compounds.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The comet does not threaten Earth and is within the orbit of Mars at perihelion,” NASA officials stated.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“We are observing this interstellar visitor to understand its origins and implications for our knowledge of the universe,” said physicist Avi Loeb of Harvard.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object, following ‘Oumuamua and Borisov. Stephen Hawking previously warned that contact with advanced extraterrestrial civilizations could lead to resource depletion on Earth, similar to historical colonial invasions. The "dark forest hypothesis" suggests that silence in the universe may be a survival strategy for civilizations.</p>

<p>NASA's ongoing monitoring efforts aim to gather data on interstellar objects and their potential implications for Earth. The agency plans to launch the Comet Interceptor mission in 2029 to study similar objects in the future.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue its observation campaign until January 2026, focusing on the comet's post-perihelion activity. Data collected will help scientists assess the potential origins and characteristics of 3I/ATLAS and inform future interstellar exploration missions.</p>
