      <h2>Interstellar comet keeps its distance as it makes its closest approach to Earth</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet known as 3I/Atlas has passed within 167 million miles (269 million kilometers) of Earth on Friday, marking its closest approach before heading back into interstellar space. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities associated with this celestial event.</p>

<p>This comet, discovered over the summer, is significant as it provides scientists with a unique opportunity to study materials from outside our solar system. NASA and astronomers are closely monitoring its trajectory and behavior as it makes this rare visit.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas passed within 167 million miles (269 million kilometers) of Earth on Friday.</li>
    <li>Discovered in summer 2025.</li>
    <li>Captured in an image by the Hubble Space Telescope on November 30, 2025.</li>
    <li>Comet's closest approach is part of its grand tour of the solar system.</li>
    <li>NASA and various astronomers are monitoring the comet's trajectory.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In summer 2025, astronomers discovered 3I/Atlas, an interstellar comet. On November 30, 2025, the comet was photographed by the Hubble Space Telescope, approximately 178 million miles (286 million kilometers) from Earth. On Friday, it made its closest approach to Earth, passing at a distance of 167 million miles (269 million kilometers).</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This comet offers a unique chance to study materials from outside our solar system,” said a NASA spokesperson.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/Atlas is one of the few known interstellar comets to visit our solar system. Its trajectory and composition provide valuable insights into the formation of celestial bodies and the conditions in other star systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to observe 3I/Atlas as it travels back into interstellar space, gathering data until it becomes too distant for current instruments to track effectively.</p>
