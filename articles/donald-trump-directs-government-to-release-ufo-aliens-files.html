      <h2>Donald Trump Directs Government to Release UFO & Aliens Files</h2>

<p>Donald Trump has issued a directive to release federal files concerning UFOs and alleged extraterrestrial life.

<p>This initiative addresses longstanding public interest in government secrecy surrounding unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) and UFOs. Trump’s directive aims to increase transparency and engage with the growing demand for information on these topics. Key political figures have expressed their support for the move, suggesting it may lead to congressional hearings on the matter.</p>
