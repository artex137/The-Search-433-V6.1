      <h2>Is 3I/ATLAS a friendly visitor or ‘serial killer’ sent to poison us?: Harvard scientist</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has raised questions about the nature of comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth, set to fly by on December 19, 2025. Loeb has suggested that the comet's chemical makeup may determine whether it is a potential threat or a source of life, noting significant levels of methanol and hydrogen cyanide detected by the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Chile.</p>

<p>This inquiry is important as it may shed light on the origins of life on Earth and the potential for other celestial bodies to influence life in the universe. Authorities continue to monitor the comet closely, with upcoming observations expected to clarify its chemical composition.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event: Comet 3I/ATLAS flyby</li>
    <li>Date: December 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Location: Near Earth</li>
    <li>Key researcher: Avi Loeb, Harvard University</li>
    <li>Observations: Methanol and hydrogen cyanide detected by ALMA</li>
    <li>Upcoming data release: Juice spacecraft in February 2026</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In recent weeks, new images of comet 3I/ATLAS have been released by the European Space Agency’s Juice spacecraft, revealing two tails and significant gas sublimation following its recent closest approach to the sun. Loeb's analysis, based on observations from the ALMA telescope, has indicated the presence of both methanol and hydrogen cyanide in the comet's gas plume.</p>

<p>In 2006, the MERLIN array at Jodrell Bank Observatory discovered a methanol cloud near a newly-formed star. In 2016, ALMA also detected methanol in a planet-forming disc around the young star TW Hydrae. These findings contribute to the ongoing discussion about the role of such chemicals in the formation of life.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“There is much more methanol than hydrogen cyanide. In principle, methanol is an important agent for the origins of life,” said Loeb.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“On the other hand, the hydrogen cyanide at large concentrations is a poison,” he added.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Loeb speculated that ATLAS is likely “friendly” given the high ratio of methanol to hydrogen cyanide, one of the highest observed in any comet.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Loeb has previously suggested that Earth may have been influenced by interstellar objects over its 4.6 billion-year history. He has called these potential visitors “interstellar gardeners,” implying they could have contributed to the building blocks of life on our planet.</p>

<p>The debate over the origins of life and the potential for extraterrestrial influence continues to be a significant area of research in astrophysics.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Loeb anticipates new insights into the chemical composition of 3I/ATLAS from upcoming observations, including a full dataset from the Juice spacecraft expected in February 2026. Additionally, the James Webb Space Telescope will observe the comet this month, coinciding with its closest approach to Earth.</p>
