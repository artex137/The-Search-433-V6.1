      <h2>Keck Observatory detects strange anti-solar tail on 3I/ATLAS interstellar object</h2>

<p>Researchers at the W. M. Keck Observatory have detected a unique anti-solar tail on the comet 3I/ATLAS, which was discovered in early July 2023 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS). The findings were reported through observations made with the Keck Cosmic Web Imager, and details were released in a preprint paper on an arXiv server.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it enhances the understanding of the comet's composition and its interaction with solar radiation. The research team aims to gather further observations to develop a more comprehensive view of the interstellar object and its environment.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: Comet 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Discovery Date: Early July 2023</li>
    <li>Observatory: W. M. Keck Observatory</li>
    <li>Research Tool: Keck Cosmic Web Imager</li>
    <li>Key Elements Detected: Nickel (Ni), cyanide (CN), and weak detection of iron (Fe)</li>
    <li>Distance of Nickel Flux: 1,243 miles (2,000 kilometers) from the comet's nucleus</li>
    <li>Distance of Cyanide Spread: 523 miles (841 kilometers) from the nucleus</li>
    <li>Observation Date: Not disclosed</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In early July 2023, astronomers discovered comet 3I/ATLAS. Following this, researchers at the W. M. Keck Observatory conducted observations using the Keck Cosmic Web Imager, leading to the detection of various elements and the unique anti-solar tail. The findings were documented in a preprint paper on an arXiv server.</p>
<p>The research team has indicated that solar radiation influences the comet's activity, causing volatile ices to sublimate and create its coma.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“When a comet warms, its volatile ices sublimate, lifting dust off the surface and creating the coma,” the research team stated.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The Ni is more centrally concentrated than CN, with the majority of Ni flux coming from the innermost 1,243 miles of 3I/ATLAS,” the team explained.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Despite every observation and hypothesis, astronomers were keen on getting the complete picture and were focused on making more observations,” noted the researchers.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The detection of the anti-solar tail on 3I/ATLAS is not unprecedented but is considered unusual. Previous observations of similar phenomena have occurred, such as with comet C/2014 UN271, which exhibited a similar enhancement due to the slow ejection of large dust particles. Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb remarked that the tail phenomenon observed in 3I/ATLAS is likely the first of its kind.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The research team plans to conduct further observations of comet 3I/ATLAS to gain additional insights into its characteristics and the environment surrounding it. They hope that future studies, particularly with the Vera C. Rubin Telescope, will facilitate the discovery of more interstellar objects.</p>
