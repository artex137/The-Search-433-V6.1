      <h2>1st known interstellar visitor 'Oumuamua is an 'exo-Pluto' — a completely new class of object, scientists say</h2>

<p>The first interstellar object observed in the solar system, 1I/'Oumuamua, may be a fragment of an icy exoplanet, according to research presented by astronomer Steve Desch of Arizona State University. Desch's findings were shared at the Progress in Understanding the Pluto Mission: 10 Years after Flyby conference in Laurel, Maryland in July. This suggests that 'Oumuamua is not just a comet but represents a new class of objects described as "exo-Plutos."</p>

<p>This discovery could change how scientists understand the composition and origins of celestial bodies. Authorities are now investigating the implications of this finding for the study of other interstellar objects and their potential presence in the solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1I/'Oumuamua was first spotted in 2017.</li>
    <li>Desch estimates 'Oumuamua is less than 2 billion years old, potentially as young as 500 million years.</li>
    <li>The object is approximately 100 meters in diameter.</li>
    <li>'Oumuamua is composed almost entirely of nitrogen ice.</li>
    <li>Desch and colleague Alan Jackson have published papers in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets in 2018 and 2021.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>1I/'Oumuamua was first detected in October 2017, quickly recognized as an interstellar object. Initially classified as a comet, its unique characteristics prompted further investigation. In July 2023, findings presented by Steve Desch revealed that 'Oumuamua may actually be a slab of nitrogen ice, leading to the classification of this object as an "exo-Pluto."</p>

<p>Prior to this, astronomers had noted the unusual elongated shape and low speed of 'Oumuamua, which did not fit the expectations for typical comets. These factors contributed to the reassessment of its classification.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "Everything about this object is consistent with it being a slab of nitrogen ice like you see on the surface of Pluto," said Steve Desch.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "'Oumuamua is in a different category of object. It's much harder to find, but there are a lot more of them," Desch added.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior research has suggested that the solar system may have ejected significant amounts of icy bodies during its formation, potentially creating a population of exo-Plutos. Desch's research aligns with earlier findings indicating that other comets may also share similar origins, hinting at a broader category of interstellar visitors.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to investigate the implications of 'Oumuamua's characteristics and its classification as an exo-Pluto. Ongoing research may reveal more about the nature of interstellar objects and their origins, particularly those that resemble fragments of icy exoplanets.</p>
