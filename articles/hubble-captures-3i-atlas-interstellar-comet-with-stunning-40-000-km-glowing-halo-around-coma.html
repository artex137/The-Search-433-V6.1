      <h2>Hubble Captures 3I/ATLAS Interstellar Comet with Stunning 40,000 km Glowing Halo Around Coma</h2>

<p>Astronomers have revealed a new image of Comet 3I/ATLAS taken by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope. The image shows a large halo, approximately 40,000 km in diameter, surrounding the comet's nucleus. There are no reports of injuries or fatalities related to this discovery.</p>

<p>This finding is significant because Comet 3I/ATLAS is classified as an interstellar comet, meaning it originates from outside the Solar System. It is one of the first such bodies to be recorded by Earth-based instruments. Researchers believe studying this comet may provide insights into planetary and stellar formation in distant galaxies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS, also known as C/2025 N1, is classified as an interstellar comet.</li>
    <li>The comet has a hyperbolic trajectory and will not return to the Solar System.</li>
    <li>The halo surrounding the comet extends approximately 40,000 km.</li>
    <li>This is only the third interstellar comet discovered and photographed by modern instruments.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The Hubble Space Telescope captured the image of Comet 3I/ATLAS recently, showing a bright halo of dust and gas surrounding its nucleus. The halo is formed from materials released due to radiation and heating from the Sun.</p>

<p>Since Comet 3I/ATLAS is on a hyperbolic trajectory, it has come from outside the Solar System and will not return. Researchers are currently observing the comet from both space and Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Researching 3I/ATLAS provides researchers with information about how planetary formation, comet formation, and stellar formation occurs in other galaxies,” said a NASA representative.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interstellar bodies like Comet 3I/ATLAS are exceedingly rare. They contain materials formed in distant star systems millions of years ago. Studying such comets may help scientists understand the chemical ingredients that contribute to the creation of life.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to observe Comet 3I/ATLAS using Hubble and ground-based telescopes. They plan to study the comet's chemistry, tail development, and behaviour as it approaches and moves away from the Sun.</p>
