      <h2>Because the CIA can neither confirm nor deny that it is investigating 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>The CIA has neither confirmed nor denied an investigation into the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, which was observed on December 30, 2025, using the Virtual Telescope Project in Manciano, Italy. The object has displayed anomalies that challenge current scientific understanding of comets, according to Avi Loeb, a Harvard astronomer. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with this investigation.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as it raises questions about the nature of 3I/ATLAS and the implications of its characteristics. Authorities, including NASA and the CIA, have responded differently to public inquiries, with NASA officially classifying it as a natural comet while the CIA has opted for a more cautious approach, suggesting a potential investigation into whether 3I/ATLAS could be a “black swan event.”</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS observed on December 30, 2025.</li>
    <li>Telescope used: Virtual Telescope Project in Manciano, Italy.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb claims the object has unexplained anomalies.</li>
    <li>NASA has closed its investigation, labeling it as a natural comet.</li>
    <li>The CIA has stated it can neither confirm nor deny the existence of related records.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On December 30, 2025, the Virtual Telescope Project captured images of 3I/ATLAS, revealing characteristics that defy conventional comet classification. Following this, Avi Loeb published an opinion article discussing these anomalies and the CIA's response to a Freedom of Information Act request made by John Greenewald Jr. The CIA stated it could neither confirm nor deny the existence of records concerning 3I/ATLAS. Meanwhile, NASA had already classified 3I/ATLAS as a natural comet on November 19, 2025, closing its case.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The simplest interpretation is that some government officials want to make sure that 3I/ATLAS is not a ‘black swan event’,” said Avi Loeb. “If this conclusion was clear from the beginning to everyone within the Government and academia, why would the CIA treat possible existence of records related to a natural comet as something sufficiently sensitive to be classified?”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The term "black swan event" refers to rare and unexpected occurrences with significant impact. Avi Loeb notes that such events have been miscalculated by intelligence agencies in the past, including the attacks on September 11, 2001, and October 7, 2023. He suggests that the CIA's cautious stance reflects a desire to avoid public panic regarding the potential implications of 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations by the CIA into 3I/ATLAS are expected to continue until the comet passes close to Jupiter's “Hill radius.” The scientific community is hopeful that further study will clarify the nature of 3I/ATLAS.</p>
