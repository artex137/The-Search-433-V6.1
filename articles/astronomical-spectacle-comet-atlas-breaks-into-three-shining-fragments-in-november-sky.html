      <h2>Astronomical Spectacle: Comet ATLAS Breaks Into Three Shining Fragments in November Sky</h2>

<p>Comet C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) has split into three luminous fragments, creating a stunning astronomical event observed throughout November 2025. The breakup, which has been captured by observatories in Europe and the United States, offers a rare chance for scientists to witness a comet disintegrating as it travels through the inner solar system.</p>

<p>This event is significant for astronomers, as it allows them to study a potentially pristine comet breaking apart due to solar forces. According to Dr. Elena Mazzotta Epifani of the Italian National Institute for Astrophysics, this fragmentation provides "highly significant" clues about the evolution and disintegration of ancient celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) was discovered in May 2025 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System.</li>
    <li>The comet began brightening rapidly as it approached perihelion on 8 October.</li>
    <li>The breakup was first captured on 11 November at the Asiago Observatory in Italy.</li>
    <li>Images from the Virtual Telescope Project show the comet's nucleus splitting between 11 and 18 November.</li>
    <li>The two brightest fragments are drifting approximately 2,000 km apart.</li>
    <li>Skywatchers in the Northern Hemisphere can observe the fragments in the constellation Ursa Major.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet ATLAS has undergone a significant transformation since its discovery:</p>
<ul>
    <li>May 2025: Comet C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) is discovered.</li>
    <li>8 October 2025: The comet approaches perihelion and begins brightening.</li>
    <li>11 November 2025: The comet's breakup is first observed at the Asiago Observatory.</li>
    <li>11-18 November 2025: The nucleus splinters into three distinct fragments.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The fragmentation offers highly significant clues about how these ancient bodies evolve and how they ultimately disintegrate,” said Dr. Elena Mazzotta Epifani.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The breakup of Comet ATLAS is a rare occurrence that provides insights into the internal structure and chemical composition of comets. Such comets are considered time capsules, preserving materials from the early solar system. The golden hue of Comet ATLAS, unlike the typical green or blue glow of other comets, suggests unique chemical properties.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the fragments of Comet ATLAS continue to separate and dissolve, scientists will monitor and analyze the event to gain further understanding of the origins of our solar system.</p>
