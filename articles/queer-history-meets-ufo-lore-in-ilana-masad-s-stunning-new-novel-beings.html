      <h2>Queer History Meets UFO Lore in Ilana Masad’s Stunning New Novel ‘Beings’</h2>

<p>Ilana Masad’s new novel, <strong>Beings</strong>, explores the intertwining stories of alien abduction and queer identity through its characters, including Betty and Barney Hill, who were the first widely documented alien abductees. The novel has received attention for its unique blend of history and fiction, merging the lives of these figures from the 1960s with contemporary themes of alienation and love.</p>

<p>The novel matters because it addresses issues of belief and identity, using the lens of speculative fiction to delve into the human experience. Masad’s work emphasizes the importance of storytelling in understanding our place in the world, particularly for marginalized communities. The book has sparked discussions about the intersections of queer history and science fiction, highlighting the emotional truths behind the characters’ experiences.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Title:</strong> Beings</li>
    <li><strong>Author:</strong> Ilana Masad</li>
    <li><strong>Publication Year:</strong> Not disclosed</li>
    <li><strong>Key Characters:</strong> Betty Hill, Barney Hill, Phyllis (lesbian science fiction writer), and a nameless archivist</li>
    <li><strong>Setting:</strong> 1960s and contemporary periods</li>
    <li><strong>Themes:</strong> Alienation, belief, queer identity</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Ilana Masad conceived <strong>Beings</strong> to explore the story of Betty and Barney Hill, who reported an alien abduction in the 1960s. The narrative initially included three intertwined threads: the Hills, Phyllis, and a genderqueer character named Star. The latter was intended to reflect experiences during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>During the writing process, Masad decided to focus on the archivist character, who represents the contemporary exploration of these historical figures. The narrative evolved to emphasize the significance of connection and belief in the face of isolation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Like all the best science fiction, where genre becomes a means of exploring feelings rather than technology, <strong>Beings</strong> shines not by demanding belief in aliens, but by showing what it means that the characters believe.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous works have examined the intersection of queer identity and speculative fiction, but <strong>Beings</strong> stands out for its focus on historical figures like the Hills. The novel engages with themes of alienation and the search for connection, reflecting broader societal issues faced by marginalized communities.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Readers can expect further discussions about the themes presented in <strong>Beings</strong> as it gains popularity. Masad's exploration of queer history through the lens of science fiction has opened new avenues for dialogue about identity and belief in contemporary literature.</p>
