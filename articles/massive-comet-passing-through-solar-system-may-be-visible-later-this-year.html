      <h2>Massive comet passing through solar system may be visible later this year</h2>

<p>The 3I/ATLAS comet is set to pass by the sun on Thursday, October 30, 2025, according to NASA. The comet will not be visible to stargazers until December, when it is expected to be seen from Earth.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it provides an opportunity for astronomers and the public to observe a rare celestial object. NASA has stated that the comet's trajectory will bring it close to the sun, which may enhance its visibility in the coming weeks.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Comet name: 3I/ATLAS</li>
  <li>Passes by the sun: October 30, 2025</li>
  <li>Visibility from Earth: Expected in December 2025</li>
  <li>Agency involved: NASA</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 30, 2025, the 3I/ATLAS comet will make its closest approach to the sun. Following this event, it will continue its journey through the solar system.</p>

<p>In December 2025, the comet is anticipated to become visible to observers on Earth, allowing for public viewing and scientific study.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
  “The comet’s close pass by the sun is a unique event that will allow astronomers to study its composition and behavior,” NASA officials said.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comets like 3I/ATLAS provide valuable insights into the early solar system. Past comets have been studied for their chemical compositions and have contributed to our understanding of planetary formation.</p>

<p>In recent years, several comets have garnered public interest, but few have been as anticipated as 3I/ATLAS, which is expected to be particularly bright.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the comet approaches, astronomers will continue to monitor its trajectory and provide updates on its visibility in December. Public viewing events may be organized to allow enthusiasts to observe the comet with telescopes.</p>
