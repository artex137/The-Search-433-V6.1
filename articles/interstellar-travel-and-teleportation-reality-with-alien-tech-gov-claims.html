      <h2>Interstellar Travel and Teleportation 'Reality' With 'Alien Tech', Gov Claims</h2>

<p>A new government-backed documentary has claimed that alien technology could soon make interstellar travel and teleportation a reality. Titled <strong>The Age of Disclosure</strong>, the film is set to premiere on 21 November 2025 in select cinemas in New York, Los Angeles, and Washington D.C., as well as on Prime Video worldwide. The documentary arrives amid increased public interest in unidentified aerial phenomena following recent congressional hearings in Washington, where officials urged transparency regarding potential extraterrestrial evidence.</p>

<p>The documentary, directed by Dan Farah, known for producing <strong>Ready Player One</strong>, aims to explore how recovered alien technology could facilitate deep-space exploration and instant transportation. Farah emphasized that the film represents 'the most credible and serious documentary ever made on this topic'. Government intelligence officials have reportedly prepared to disclose "alien technology," which they claim could be the biggest discovery in human history.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>

<p>During the documentary, testimonies from high-level officials assert that non-human technology could unlock interstellar travel and teleportation. The film documents an alleged 80-year effort by the U.S. government to conceal such technology.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>

It features testimonies from senior politicians and military officers, including Senators Marco Rubio and Kirsten Gillibrand, and former Director of National Intelligence Jim Clapper. The film aims to reshape public perception of humanity's place in the cosmos through a blend of science, politics, and personal accounts.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The documentary is set to debut on 21 November 2025. Its release has sparked anticipation regarding the potential redefinition of scientific boundaries and the future of space exploration through the lens of alleged alien technology.</p>
