      <h2>Third interstellar object offers rare glimpse of material from another solar system</h2>

<p>Astronomers have detected a new interstellar object, designated 3I/ATLAS, using the ATLAS telescope in Chile on July 1, 2025. This object is traveling on a hyperbolic path through the solar system and marks the third known interstellar body discovered, following ‘Oumuamua in 2017 and Borisov in 2019. There are no reported injuries or fatalities related to this discovery.</p>

<p>The detection of 3I/ATLAS is significant for scientific research, as it provides a unique opportunity to study material from outside our solar system. In response to the discovery, NASA has confirmed the finding and initiated coordinated observations using multiple telescopes, including the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, Hubble Space Telescope, and James Webb Space Telescope, along with several ground-based facilities.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date detected:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from the Sun:</strong> Approximately 3.5 astronomical units (about 525 million kilometers)</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to the Sun:</strong> October 30, 2025, at 1.4 astronomical units (210 million kilometers)</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Approximately 60 kilometers per second relative to the Sun</li>
    <li><strong>Water loss rate:</strong> About 40 kilograms per second</li>
    <li><strong>Size of nucleus:</strong> Believed to be a few kilometers wide</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Astronomers first detected 3I/ATLAS on July 1, 2025. Initial analysis confirmed the object is not gravitationally bound to the Sun. Within days, observatories worldwide commenced coordinated follow-up campaigns. NASA confirmed the detection and initiated multi-mission observations shortly after the discovery.</p>
<p>On October 30, 2025, 3I/ATLAS will make its closest approach to the Sun. Observations are ongoing to capture data on its composition and behavior as it moves through the solar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Each interstellar object provides a limited opportunity to study material that formed around another star,” said an astronomer involved in the research. “This discovery adds valuable data on how planetary systems evolve.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS adds to the growing list of interstellar bodies observed in our solar system. The previous objects, ‘Oumuamua and Borisov, have provided insights into materials formed under different stellar conditions. Improvements in survey telescopes, such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile, are expected to enhance the detection of similar objects in the coming years.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze data from 3I/ATLAS after its closest approach. This includes capturing spectra, measuring dust release, and modeling its composition before the object fades from view as it moves back into interstellar space.</p>
