      <h2>NASA spacecraft reveal interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS brightened rapidly as it swooped behind the sun</h2>

<p>NASA has confirmed that interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has rapidly brightened as it approaches perihelion, its closest point to the sun, on Thursday, October 29. Researchers and amateur astronomers have tracked its progress using spacecraft data while the comet is currently obscured from Earth's view.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it provides insights into the behavior of interstellar comets. Authorities, including NASA and the European Space Agency, are actively monitoring the comet with various spacecraft, aiming to gather more data about its characteristics and trajectory.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is expected to reach perihelion on October 29, 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet has been detected by NASA's GOES-19 weather satellite and the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO).</li>
    <li>It is moving at speeds exceeding 130,000 mph (210,000 km/h).</li>
    <li>At perihelion, the comet is estimated to reach a brightness of magnitude 9.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS may be visible again to Earth-based telescopes by early December 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet could be the largest interstellar object ever recorded, with a maximum width of about 5.6 km.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 18, 2023, amateur astronomer Worachate Boonplod detected comet 3I/ATLAS using images from the GOES-19 satellite. The comet was noted to be easily visible until October 24. On October 28, researchers published a study indicating the comet had undergone rapid brightening ahead of perihelion.</p>
<p>Spacecraft including NASA's PUNCH mission and SOHO have been tracking the comet’s activity since its discovery in July 2023.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Its brightness is comparable to nearby stars with magnitude ~11,” Boonplod stated in the Comets Mailing List group.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The comet is distinctly bluer than the sun, which is consistent with gas emissions contributing substantially to the comet’s increased brightness near perihelion,” said the authors of the recent study.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is only the third known interstellar comet. Its high speed and trajectory suggest it has been traveling through space for billions of years. Previous studies indicate it may be around 3 billion years older than our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA expects comet 3I/ATLAS to become visible to Earth-based telescopes by early December 2023, and it may be observed by spacecraft orbiting Jupiter during a close approach in March 2026.</p>
