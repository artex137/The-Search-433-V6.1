      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS could soon be seen by spacecraft at Mars, Jupiter and the Sun, scientists say</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is currently traveling through our Solar System and may be observed by spacecraft at Mars, Jupiter, and near the Sun, according to a recent study led by Thomas Marshall Eubanks. The comet is set to become less visible from Earth after it moves behind the Sun, where it will not be seen from Earth-based telescopes until early December 2025.</p>

<p>This observation opportunity is significant because scientists believe 3I/ATLAS could be a remnant from a crucial period in the Milky Way's history, known as 'cosmic noon', approximately 9 to 13 billion years ago. The study highlights the potential for existing spacecraft to gather valuable data on the comet's composition and activity during its journey.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is currently moving through the Solar System.</li>
    <li>It will not be visible from Earth until early December 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Mars is expected on 3 October 2025.</li>
    <li>Spacecraft involved include Emirates Mars Mission, NASA's MAVEN, Juno, and the Parker Solar Probe.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is expected to be 28 million km (18 million miles) from Mars during its closest approach.</li>
    <li>The comet may be observed in the ultraviolet spectrum by various instruments.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has been making its way through the Solar System and is currently not visible from Earth. Its closest approach to Mars will occur on 3 October 2025. As it travels, spacecraft at Mars, Jupiter, and near the Sun will attempt to observe the comet.</p>
<p>In November 2025, the European Space Agency's Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (Juice) will attempt observations of 3I/ATLAS in its active state. NASA's Parker Solar Probe will also aim to capture images of the comet from late September to early November 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“If confirmed, 3I will provide a means to explore the stellar and planetesimal formation process, and its astrobiological implications, in an early period of galactic history,” the study states.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is believed to be a remnant from the Milky Way's 'thick disk' during a period of intense star formation. Observations of this comet could enhance our understanding of the early formation processes in the galaxy.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Spacecraft at Mars and near the Sun are preparing to gather data on 3I/ATLAS during its closest approach. Further analysis and observations will be conducted to learn more about the comet's activity and composition as it moves through the Solar System.</p>
