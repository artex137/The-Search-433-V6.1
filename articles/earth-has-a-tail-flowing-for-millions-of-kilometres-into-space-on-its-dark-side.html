      <h2>Earth has a tail, flowing for millions of kilometres into space on its dark side</h2>

<p>Earth possesses a tail that may extend up to two million kilometres into space, according to NASA. This tail, located on the planet's dark side, has gained attention alongside the third interstellar visitor observed in our solar system, Comet 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<p>This discovery highlights the complexity of Earth’s interaction with solar phenomena. NASA has clarified that the tail results from the planet's magnetic field, which influences charged particles in space and protects Earth from the solar wind.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Earth's tail may extend up to <strong>two million kilometres</strong> into space.</li>
    <li>The tail is located on the <strong>dark side</strong> of the planet.</li>
    <li>NASA states that the tail is formed by the <strong>magnetosphere</strong> and plasma.</li>
    <li>The tail's precise length is <strong>not disclosed</strong>.</li>
    <li>Earth’s tail is similar to tails observed on other celestial bodies like Mercury.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>NASA has recently confirmed the existence of Earth’s tail, drawing parallels with Comet 3I/ATLAS. The tail's formation is attributed to the interaction between the solar wind and the Earth's magnetosphere, which has been studied for decades.</p>
<p>Mercury's tail, created by sodium released as it approaches the Sun, has been known for some time, prompting further investigation into the tails of other celestial bodies, including Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The magnetosphere dominates the behaviour of electrically charged particles in space near Earth and shields the planet from the solar wind,” NASA stated.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“This tail is likely a return flow of plasma happening because of the solar wind,” according to NASA.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of Earth’s tail adds to the understanding of planetary atmospheres and their interactions with solar activity. Previous studies have focused on the magnetosphere's role in protecting Earth from cosmic events, highlighting its importance in space weather phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further research is necessary to determine the exact characteristics and implications of Earth’s tail. Scientists will continue to monitor the interactions of the magnetosphere with solar winds to better understand this phenomenon.</p>
