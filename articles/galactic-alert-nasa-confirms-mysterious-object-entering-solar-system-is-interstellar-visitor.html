      <h2>Galactic alert: NASA confirms mysterious object entering solar system is ‘interstellar’ visitor</h2>

<p>A mysterious object identified as a rare interstellar comet, named 3I/Atlas, has been confirmed by NASA. The comet, which originated from outside the solar system, was detected in July by NASA’s ATLAS (Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System) survey telescope in Chile. It is currently traveling towards the sun from the direction of the constellation Sagittarius and poses no threat to Earth, remaining approximately 150 million miles away.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as 3I/Atlas is only the third interstellar object ever observed. NASA has stated that the comet is moving at a speed of about 245 kilometres per hour (152 mph) along a flat and straight trajectory, a movement unlike any other object in the solar system. Scientists are actively studying its size and composition, as the comet will remain visible to ground-based telescopes until early December.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet name: 3I/Atlas</li>
    <li>Detection: July 2023 by NASA's ATLAS telescope in Chile</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth: Approximately 150 million miles</li>
    <li>Speed: About 245 km/h (152 mph)</li>
    <li>Visibility: Through early December 2023</li>
    <li>Previous interstellar objects: Comet 2I/Borisov (2019) and ‘Oumuamua (2017)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2023, NASA's ATLAS telescope detected the comet 3I/Atlas as it entered the solar system. The object has been confirmed to be an interstellar visitor, marking a significant event in astronomical studies. The comet is currently on a trajectory that will allow it to be observed until early December 2023, when it will pass too close to the sun for visibility.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“NASA has confirmed 3I/Atlas is an interstellar object, meaning it originated outside our solar system and is briefly traveling through it,” said a NASA spokesperson.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The detection of 3I/Atlas adds to the growing understanding of interstellar objects. Prior to this discovery, only two such objects have been recorded. The previous sightings, Comet 2I/Borisov in 2019 and ‘Oumuamua in 2017, have sparked significant interest and research in the field of astronomy.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA scientists will continue to study the size and composition of 3I/Atlas as it remains visible in the coming months. The comet will reappear on the other side of the sun on Sunday and will be monitored until early December.</p>
