      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Sparks Celebrity Involvement in Scientific Inquiry</h2>

<p>A Harvard astrophysicist has invited Kim Kardashian to join his research team to study comet 3I/ATLAS, which is currently approaching Earth. This invitation follows Kardashian's recent engagement with NASA's acting administrator, Sean Duffy, regarding the comet's potential origins. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in relation to the comet.</p>

<p>The invitation to Kardashian highlights the growing public interest and debate surrounding the comet, particularly after it exhibited unusual characteristics. Authorities, including Republican congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna, are pushing NASA to release additional data and images of the comet to further scientific understanding.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is estimated to be the size of Manhattan.</li>
    <li>Kardashian engaged with NASA on X, prompting a response from Sean Duffy.</li>
    <li>Duffy stated, “No aliens. No threat to life here on Earth.”</li>
    <li>Congresswoman Luna has requested data from NASA's HiRISE camera taken on October 2-3.</li>
    <li>Loeb has accused NASA of not responding to his similar requests for data.</li>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS passed within approximately 30 million kilometers (18.6 million miles) of Mars on October 3, 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 2-3, 2025, NASA's HiRISE camera captured images of comet 3I/ATLAS as it passed near Mars. Following this event, Kardashian publicly engaged with NASA's acting administrator on social media, asking for insights about the comet. Duffy responded, clarifying that there was no evidence of alien involvement.</p>

<p>In response to the growing interest, Congresswoman Luna sent a letter to NASA requesting the release of images and data regarding the comet. She emphasized the importance of this information for understanding interstellar visitors.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Kim Kardashian is Welcome to Join my Research Team on 3I/ATLAS.” 
    <strong>— Dr. Avi Loeb</strong>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “This information is of great importance to advancing our understanding of interstellar visitors and their interaction with our solar system.” 
    <strong>— Rep. Anna Paulina Luna</strong>
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident comes amid ongoing discussions about the nature of interstellar objects. Dr. Avi Loeb has previously suggested that unusual behaviors of such objects could indicate the presence of alien technology. The push for transparency from NASA reflects a broader interest in understanding these phenomena within the scientific community and among the public.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA is expected to address Congresswoman Luna's requests for data and images. Ongoing research into comet 3I/ATLAS will continue as scientists seek to analyze the data collected from previous observations, including those from the HiRISE camera.</p>
