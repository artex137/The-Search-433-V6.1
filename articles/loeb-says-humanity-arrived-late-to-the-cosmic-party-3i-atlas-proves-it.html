      <h2>Loeb Says Humanity Arrived Late To The Cosmic Party — 3I/ATLAS Proves It</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist <strong>Avi Loeb</strong> has highlighted the significance of the interstellar comet <strong>3I/ATLAS</strong> following its closest approach to Earth on <strong>19 December 2025</strong>, when it came within <strong>268.91 million kilometres</strong> of the planet. Loeb stated that the comet's behaviour showed no signs of artificial activity, as it continued its orbit within the solar system.</p>

<p>This event underscores humanity’s relative insignificance in the universe, according to Loeb. He argues that humans arrived late to what he describes as the “local cosmic party,” suggesting that our civilization is a newcomer in a galaxy that has existed for billions of years. He has called for further exploration of interstellar objects to better understand our position in the cosmos.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS approached Earth on 19 December 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest distance recorded was 268.91 million kilometres.</li>
    <li>Next significant approach to Jupiter is predicted for 16 March 2026.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will come within 53.3 million kilometres of Jupiter.</li>
    <li>Amateur astronomers captured images showing a tail nearly 1 million kilometres long.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The comet 3I/ATLAS passed closest to Earth on 19 December 2025. Before this, it crossed the opposite side of the Sun in October 2025, with a projection of five degrees towards the ecliptic view. It is expected to fly past Jupiter on 16 March 2026, which will be a significant event for further observations.</p>

<p>During its approach, amateur astronomers documented its impressive tail, which is notably ten times longer than it is wide. Loeb has indicated that these features warrant further study.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The quiet flight of the comet over the earth points to an embarrassing fact: we were the last to arrive at a great galactic party,” said Loeb.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Loeb also mentioned, “Studying interstellar objects such as 3I/ATLAS will lead to the emergence of a new field I call 'interstellar archaeology,'” highlighting the potential for new scientific discoveries.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Historically, humankind has viewed Earth as the centre of the universe. Loeb asserts that the observations of 3I/ATLAS challenge this perspective, emphasizing the need for a shift in how we understand our place in the cosmos. He suggests that the comet serves as a reminder of the vastness of the universe and the limited time humans have been part of it.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to gather imaging and spectroscopic data over the coming months to further investigate the anomalies observed with 3I/ATLAS. The upcoming observations by NASA's Juno spacecraft during its flyby of Jupiter are expected to provide critical information about the comet's behaviour.</p>
