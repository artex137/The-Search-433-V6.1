      <h2>Harvard Expert Avi Loeb Warns Interstellar Visitor 3I/ATLAS May Be by 'Design'</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist Professor Avi Loeb has raised concerns about the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, suggesting it may have been engineered rather than being a natural comet. The object was discovered by the ATLAS survey telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile, on July 1, 2025. It reached its closest point to the sun, known as perihelion, on October 29, 2025, at a distance of approximately 203 million kilometres.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as it challenges existing understandings of interstellar objects and their origins. Loeb's claims prompt further examination into the nature of 3I/ATLAS and similar celestial bodies. Authorities and researchers may need to consider new detection and analysis methods for such objects moving through our solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object name: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Discovery date: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Discovery location: Rio Hurtado, Chile</li>
    <li>Perihelion date: October 29, 2025</li>
    <li>Perihelion distance: 203 million kilometres from the sun</li>
    <li>Initial speed: 137,000 miles per hour</li>
    <li>Speed at perihelion: 153,000 miles per hour</li>
    <li>Estimated diameter: up to 5.6 kilometres</li>
    <li>Estimated weight: approximately one billion tons</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the ATLAS survey telescope discovered 3I/ATLAS moving rapidly through space. Initially, it travelled at about 137,000 miles per hour. Over time, as it approached the sun, it accelerated to 153,000 miles per hour. On October 29, 2025, it reached its perihelion, which is its closest point to the sun, at a distance of about 203 million kilometres.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“If 3I/ATLAS was not a random wanderer but was instead 'targeting' the inner solar system by technological design, the statistics change entirely,” said Professor Loeb.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Our region of space is an area of specific interest to an external intelligence, making the visit a high-stakes event that merits a serious emotional and scientific response,” he added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Loeb's assertions about 3I/ATLAS could reshape our understanding of interstellar objects. He estimates there may be a trillion similar objects in our solar system, with the potential for 10^23 interstellar comets in the Milky Way. This perspective shifts the narrative from viewing 3I/ATLAS as an anomaly to considering it as part of a vast population of celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Loeb has proposed a three-layered screening process for future interstellar encounters. This includes using wide-field survey telescopes, developing high-resolution imaging capabilities on the moon, and preparing interceptor missions to investigate these objects more closely.</p>
