      <h2>UFOs, Crashes and an 80 Year Cover Up as Insider Claims Explode on Dave Rubin Show</h2>

<p>Filmmaker Dan Farah has claimed on the Dave Rubin Show that the United States government has known about non-human intelligence for over 80 years, revealing this information through a new documentary. The documentary, titled The Age of Disclosure, features insights from former government insiders and intelligence officials and has sparked significant public interest.</p>

<p>Farah's documentary aims to present credible testimonies from individuals with direct government experience, challenging the narrative that UFOs are mere fiction. He asserts that the public has been kept in the dark about technology and incidents involving non-human entities, raising questions about transparency and government accountability.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Documentary titled The Age of Disclosure released recently.</li>
    <li>Claims of UFO crashes dating back to the 1940s, including the Roswell incident.</li>
    <li>Allegations of recovery of non-human bodies at crash sites.</li>
    <li>Farah has a background in mainstream Hollywood, producing films like Ready Player One.</li>
    <li>Documentary features interviews with individuals who have had official government roles.</li>
    <li>Increased bipartisan interest in the topic of UFOs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In the 1940s, various claims of UFO crashes begin to surface, with notable incidents like Roswell gaining widespread attention. Over the decades, government officials reportedly have gathered and studied technology from these incidents. Recently, Dan Farah has gathered testimonies from former officials and created The Age of Disclosure, which explores these claims and the implications of advanced technology.</p>

<p>Farah has noted that the documentary has become widely viewed online, reflecting a growing public appetite for information on the subject. He believes that the era of silence surrounding these claims may be coming to an end.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Strength in numbers offers protection,” Farah said, explaining his approach to gathering testimonies from former officials.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The strongest evidence today is credibility,” he added, emphasizing the importance of the backgrounds of those speaking out.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discussion of UFOs and non-human intelligence has been a topic of speculation for decades. Historically, claims about UFO sightings and crashes have often been dismissed as conspiracy theories. However, the emergence of credible voices from within the government may indicate a shift in public perception and acceptance of these claims.</p>

<p>Farah's documentary highlights a potential global technology race, with nations like the United States, China, and Russia reportedly competing to reverse engineer advanced technologies allegedly recovered from UFOs.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As public interest and bipartisan support grow, there may be increasing pressure for government transparency regarding UFOs and non-human intelligence. Farah suggests that a formal acknowledgment from a sitting US president could occur in the near future, marking a significant moment in the ongoing discourse surrounding these topics.</p>
