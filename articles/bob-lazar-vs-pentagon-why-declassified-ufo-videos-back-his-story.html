      <h2>Bob Lazar vs Pentagon: Why declassified UFO videos back his story</h2>

<p>Bob Lazar's claims about unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs) have gained renewed attention following the release of Navy cockpit videos by the US Department of Defense in 2017 and 2020. These videos show UAPs performing maneuvers beyond known aircraft capabilities, raising questions about their origin and technology.</p>

<p>The Pentagon's release of these videos is significant as they provide visual evidence supporting Lazar's long-standing assertions about advanced propulsion systems. Authorities continue to investigate UAPs, but have not confirmed any connection to extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>UAPs reportedly dropped from 60,000 feet to sea level in seconds.</li>
    <li>The Pentagon released videos of UAPs in 2017 and 2020.</li>
    <li>Bob Lazar first described UFOs at S-4 in 1989.</li>
    <li>The most famous video shows a white, oval-shaped craft with no visible exhaust or wings.</li>
    <li>Videos depict UAPs with no heat signatures or fuel trails.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 1989, Bob Lazar claimed to have witnessed advanced UFO technology at a site known as S-4, asserting that these crafts utilized gravity-based propulsion. In 2017, the US Department of Defense released the first of several Navy cockpit videos, showing UAPs performing incredible aerial maneuvers. A subsequent release in 2020 further fueled discussions about the nature of these phenomena.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The behaviour of these UAPs mirrors Lazar’s decades-old testimony,” said an unnamed physicist, highlighting the similarities between the videos and Lazar's descriptions.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Bob Lazar's claims have sparked debate in both UFO circles and scientific discussions for over three decades. His assertions about gravity-driven propulsion have drawn interest from physicists, particularly in light of the Pentagon's recent video releases. While the Pentagon has not linked these UAPs to alien technology, the ongoing investigations suggest a growing acknowledgement of the need to understand these phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into UAPs continue, with authorities aiming to gather more data and insights. The outcome of these inquiries may influence future policies regarding aerial phenomena and defense strategies.</p>
