      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Update: No Explosion After Near-Sun Encounter</h2>

<p>On November 12, 2025, scientists have confirmed that Comet 3I/ATLAS has not exploded following its close approach to the sun. This news comes just ahead of the comet's closest point to Earth, scheduled for December 19, 2025.</p>

<p>This development is significant as it alleviates concerns about the comet's stability after its near-encounter with solar activity. Experts have been monitoring the comet closely, and officials are preparing for its upcoming flyby, which could provide valuable data for ongoing research in cometary science.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event Date: November 12, 2025</li>
    <li>Comet Name: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Closest Approach to Earth: December 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Status: No explosion confirmed</li>
    <li>Monitoring Agency: Not disclosed</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 12, 2025, reports indicated the comet's proximity to the sun raised concerns about its potential to disintegrate. However, scientists have since confirmed that 3I/ATLAS has remained intact.</p>
<p>As the comet approaches Earth, researchers are preparing for detailed observations during its flyby, which is expected to occur in just over a month.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“There were concerns about the comet's stability after its close approach to the sun, but we can confirm it has not exploded,” a representative from the monitoring agency stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable for being one of the few comets that has come close to the sun in recent years, drawing significant attention from the scientific community. Its trajectory and behavior during this approach are of particular interest, as they can provide insights into the composition and dynamics of comets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the comet continues its journey towards Earth, scientists will conduct further observations and analyses in preparation for its closest approach, scheduled for December 19, 2025.
