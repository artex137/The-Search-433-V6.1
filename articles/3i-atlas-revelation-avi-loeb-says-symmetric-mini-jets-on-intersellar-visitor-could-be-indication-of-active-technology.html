      <h2>3I/ATLAS Revelation: Avi Loeb Says Symmetric Mini-Jets on Intersellar Visitor Could Be Indication of Active Technology</h2>

<p>Astrophysicist <strong>Avi Loeb</strong> has announced that the interstellar object <strong>3I/ATLAS</strong> may exhibit signs of active technology, based on new analysis of images from the Hubble Space Telescope. The object first entered our solar system in July 2025 and passed its closest approach to the sun on <strong>October 29, 2025</strong>. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This discovery has sparked significant interest in the scientific community. Loeb's analysis suggests that the object's geometric arrangement of mini-jets could challenge existing theories of natural comet formation. Authorities are now examining the implications of these findings, as they may indicate the presence of advanced technology.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Entry into solar system: July 2025</li>
    <li>Perihelion date: October 29, 2025</li>
    <li>Speed: 58 kilometers per second</li>
    <li>Mini-jets: Three jets spaced 120 degrees apart; one anti-tail jet extending up to 400,000 kilometers</li>
    <li>Loeb Scale ranking: Currently at Level 4, potentially moving to Level 6</li>
    <li>Next significant date: January 22, 2026, for near-opposition alignment</li>
    <li>Upcoming pass by Jupiter: March 16, 2026</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected in July 2025 as it entered the solar system. On <strong>October 29, 2025</strong>, it reached perihelion, prompting further analysis of its structure. Recent findings from the Hubble Space Telescope revealed a unique arrangement of mini-jets, suggesting possible technological origins. A potential near-opposition alignment is set for <strong>January 22, 2026</strong>, allowing for enhanced observation of the jets.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The precision of these features has led to the question: could this be a technological signature?” said Dr. Frank Laukien, a colleague of Loeb.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “Scientific progress requires patience, but the pursuit of symmetry in the stars remains the most invigorating hunt of all,” Loeb noted.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This analysis builds on previous discussions surrounding interstellar objects, particularly following the discovery of <strong>Oumuamua</strong> in 2017. Loeb has been a prominent figure in advocating for the investigation of potential technosignatures from objects beyond our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to observe 3I/ATLAS closely during the near-opposition alignment on January 22, 2026. This period will provide a unique opportunity to study the mini-jets and determine if they are indeed signs of active technology.</p>
