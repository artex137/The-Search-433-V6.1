      <h2>Interstellar Oddity: 3I/ATLAS Anti-Tail Extends 400,000km Toward The Sun</h2>

<p>Scientists have observed an unusual feature of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, which has an anti-tail extending more than 400,000 kilometres toward the Sun. Recent photographs captured by astronomers in December 2025 revealed the structure of this anti-tail, raising questions about the nature of the particles involved.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it challenges existing theories about cometary behavior. The characteristics of the anti-tail suggest that the particles are larger than those found in typical comets, prompting scientists to reconsider what defines a comet. Various research teams are now investigating the implications of this finding.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Anti-tail length: 400,000 kilometres</li>
    <li>Observation date: December 2025</li>
    <li>Astronomers involved: Toni Scarmato and Teerasak Thaluang</li>
    <li>Mass loss: 150 kg/s at Sun-facing side, rising to 500 kg/s before perihelion</li>
    <li>Jet particle size: Between 1 and 100 microns</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In December 2025, astronomers Toni Scarmato and Teerasak Thaluang used gradient filters to capture images of 3I/ATLAS, revealing a long anti-tail extending toward the Sun. The observed jet length and particle dynamics have led scientists to question the classification of 3I/ATLAS as a natural comet.</p>

<p>Calculations show that typical cometary dust particles, which are smaller than one micron, would not be able to achieve the observed jet length due to solar radiation pressure. This has led to further investigations into the particle sizes involved.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The glow of the anti-tail is caused by larger particles, which is contrary to what we typically observe in comets,” said an unnamed researcher involved in the study. “This raises new questions about the dynamics of interstellar bodies.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS adds to the growing body of knowledge about interstellar objects visiting our solar system. Previous interstellar visitors have also prompted scientists to reconsider existing models of cometary behavior. The unique characteristics of 3I/ATLAS may indicate that interstellar comets do not conform to the same physical principles as those found within our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to use the James Webb Space Telescope to measure the Doppler shifts of the jets in order to refine estimates of particle size and velocity. This could provide crucial insights into whether 3I/ATLAS is a unique comet or something entirely different.</p>
