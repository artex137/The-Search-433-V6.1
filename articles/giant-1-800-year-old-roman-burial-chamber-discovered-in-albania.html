      <h2>U.S. Military Drone Strikes UFO in Yemen, Video Presented at Congressional Hearing</h2>

<p>Congressman Eric Burlison has shared a video during a congressional hearing that shows a U.S. military drone firing a Hellfire missile at an unidentified glowing orb on October 30, 2024, off the coast of Yemen. The video indicates that the UFO remained unaffected by the missile strike, which weighed 100 pounds.</p>

<p>This development has drawn attention to the ongoing debate about the existence of unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The video was presented during a hearing featuring military whistleblowers who have testified under oath about their encounters with UFOs, despite the U.S. military's public denial of such phenomena. Authorities are now reviewing the implications of these testimonies and the presented evidence.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of incident: October 30, 2024</li>
    <li>Location: Off the coast of Yemen</li>
    <li>Type of missile: Hellfire missile</li>
    <li>Weight of missile: 100 pounds</li>
    <li>Duration of testimony: Not disclosed</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 30, 2024, a U.S. military drone fired a Hellfire missile at a glowing orb during a mission along the Yemen coast. The black and white video of the incident was later presented at a congressional hearing led by Congressman Eric Burlison.</p>
<p>During this hearing, several military whistleblowers testified about their experiences with UFOs. They described various types of unidentified crafts, including giant triangles, glowing cubes, and spherical vehicles. Some whistleblowers reported feeling pressured by the U.S. government to remain silent about their observations.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This video is exceptional evidence of the existence of UFOs,” said Jeffery Nuccetell, a former military police officer who testified at the hearing.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The congressional hearing comes amid increasing public interest in UFOs and reports of military encounters with unidentified aerial phenomena. The U.S. military has consistently denied the existence of UFOs, despite mounting testimonies from military personnel.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities are expected to further investigate the claims made during the hearing and analyze the video evidence presented. Next steps include reviewing military protocols regarding the reporting of UFO sightings and possible implications for national security.
