      <h2>3I/ATLAS Shows Signs of Full Cometary Awakening after Perihelion</h2>

<p>NASA’s SPHEREx mission has observed the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS displaying significant changes in behavior after its closest approach to the Sun on December 8 to 15, 2025. The object is now showing characteristics of a fully active comet, according to a report by Dr. Carey Lisse and colleagues from the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory.</p>

<p>This development is important as it indicates that 3I/ATLAS is now actively sublimating ice and releasing gas and dust, similar to typical comets found in the Solar System. Researchers are analyzing the new data to understand the implications of this transformation for our knowledge of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Observation period: December 8 to 15, 2025</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun: perihelion</li>
    <li>New gas emissions detected: cyanide (CN), water (H<sub>2</sub>O), organics (C-H), carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), carbon monoxide (CO)</li>
    <li>Water activity increased 20 times compared to August 2025</li>
    <li>CO emissions increased 20 times, CO/CO<sub>2</sub> abundance ratio increased 15-fold</li>
    <li>Next observation scheduled for April 2026</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In August 2025, SPHEREx conducted pre-perihelion observations of 3I/ATLAS, which showed limited activity. Following perihelion, from December 8 to 15, 2025, SPHEREx re-observed the object and noted a marked increase in its activity, including the presence of new gas emissions.</p>

<p>The observations indicate that 3I/ATLAS has spent 3.5 months inside the Solar System's ice line, leading to the sublimation of not only highly volatile components but also bulk matrix comet material.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The December 2025 observations are consistent with a comet that is now fully active, sublimating even water ice,” said Dr. Carey Lisse.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The very different morphologies suggest that CN and C-H are sourced from the dust, while the H<sub>2</sub>O, CO<sub>2</sub>, and CO-gas is from a symmetric region centered on the nucleus,” the scientists noted.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is an interstellar object that has garnered interest due to its unique composition and behavior. Observations made prior to December 2025 indicated limited activity, raising questions about its potential for transformation as it approached the Sun.</p>

<p>The recent findings provide insight into the physical changes that occur when such objects enter the inner Solar System, highlighting the potential for 3I/ATLAS to behave more like traditional comets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to conduct a more detailed analysis of 3I/ATLAS before its next pass through the SPHEREx survey pattern in April 2026. A comprehensive study will be produced for publication in the Research Notes of the AAS.</p>
