      <h2>Video and images show interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS's movement across the night sky</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar visitor, has been observed moving through our Solar System, with images captured on 3 July 2025, by the European Southern Observatory’s Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Chile. The comet is on a journey across the Universe and was discovered by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) on 1 July 2025.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as 3I/ATLAS is one of only three known interstellar objects to have entered our Solar System. Observations from various powerful telescopes, including the Hubble Space Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope, have provided valuable insights into its trajectory and characteristics. Authorities and astronomers are monitoring the comet's path as it approaches the inner Solar System.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered on 1 July 2025 by ATLAS.</li>
    <li>Captured images on 3 July 2025 over approximately 13 minutes.</li>
    <li>Images taken at the Very Large Telescope in Atacama Desert, Chile.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will make its closest approach to Earth in late October 2025.</li>
    <li>Will be hidden behind the Sun during its closest approach.</li>
    <li>Expected to become observable again in December 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 1 July 2025, Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered by ATLAS. Just two days later, on 3 July 2025, the Very Large Telescope captured images of the comet's movement across the night sky. These observations were made over a span of 13 minutes.</p>

<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey, it is expected to reach its closest point to Earth in late October 2025, though it will not be visible at that time. The comet will reappear in December 2025 as it exits the Solar System.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This was the deepest and best image of the comet we had at the time,” said a representative from the European Southern Observatory.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable for being one of only three interstellar objects identified in our Solar System, joining 1I/ʻOumuamua, discovered in 2017, and 2I/Borisov, discovered in 2019. The study of these objects provides valuable information about the formation and evolution of comets and planetary systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to monitor the trajectory of 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the inner Solar System, preparing for its reappearance in December 2025.</p>
