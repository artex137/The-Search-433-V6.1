      <h2>3I/Atlas isn’t deep space aliens and didn’t ‘change color’</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has drawn significant attention since its discovery in early July, becoming the third known object to visit our solar system from deep space. The comet, traveling at approximately 209,000 kilometres per hour, made its closest pass to the sun on October 30, allowing three spacecraft to document it.</p>

<p>This event matters as it provides scientists with a rare opportunity to study a fast-moving comet and dispel misconceptions about its appearance. Authorities and researchers emphasize the importance of accurate information, especially as misinformation about the comet has proliferated online.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovery: Early July 2023</li>
    <li>Closest pass to the sun: October 30, 2023</li>
    <li>Speed: Approximately 209,000 km/h</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2023, at a distance of about 267 million km</li>
    <li>Study coauthor: Qicheng Zhang, Lowell Observatory</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in early July 2023. Following this, the comet made its closest approach to the sun on October 30. Early observations noted a rapid brightening of the comet's gas coma as it approached the sun. This brightening began in early September, with some hobbyist astronomers capturing images of the comet’s bluish-green gas coma.</p>

<p>On November 7, Qicheng Zhang addressed the spread of misinformation regarding the comet’s color, stating that the brightening of the coma may have led to misinterpretations of its appearance. The comet is expected to reach its closest point to Earth on December 19, 2023.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We don’t have any evidence for the gas coma changing colors,” Zhang told Space.com on November 7. “Our result just showed that the gas coma is likely still around and contributing substantially to the overall brightness.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“A large fraction of the misinformation I’ve seen floating around can be directly traced back to [Avi Loeb] misinterpreting [or] not fully reading the papers or data he comments on,” Zhang added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is a unique comet, being one of only three known to have originated from outside our solar system. The comet's high speed and brightening coma provide valuable data for scientists studying the characteristics and behaviours of comets.</p>

<p>Misinformation regarding celestial objects is common, especially as public interest grows. This has led to increased scrutiny of claims made by individuals in the scientific community.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA has not yet released additional images of 3I/ATLAS due to limited operations during the US government shutdown. However, images from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter taken on October 3 may still be released. Interest in the comet is expected to increase as it approaches Earth on December 19.</p>
