      <h2>Footprints of Civilization Discovered in Austria</h2>
<p>A series of ancient circular formations has been uncovered in Burgenland, Austria, near the Hungarian border, revealing insights into early human civilization. The discovery, reported by Artnet News, dates back to the Middle Neolithic period, approximately 5,000 years ago.</p>

<p>This finding is significant as it sheds light on the cultural techniques of agriculture and animal husbandry developed by Neolithic societies. Nikolaus Franz, director of Archaeology at Burgenland, described the site as a "supra-regional centre" that indicates a shift from hunting and gathering to settled agricultural practices.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Location: Burgenland, Austria, near the Hungarian border</li>
    <li>Diameter of circles: 107 meters</li>
    <li>Date of discovery: Not disclosed</li>
    <li>Historical period: Middle Neolithic, approximately 5,000 years ago</li>
    <li>Significance: Indicates early agricultural and animal husbandry practices</li>
    <li>Expert involved: Nikolaus Franz, director of Archaeology at Burgenland</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The discovery of the circular formations occurred in recently excavated land in Burgenland. Experts have dated these structures to the fifth millennium BC, a time when early humans transitioned from nomadic lifestyles to settled agriculture.</p>
<p>According to Nikolaus Franz, the site features three monumental structures in close proximity, which allows for significant insights into the lives of Neolithic settler clans.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The Rechnitz site can be considered a supra-regional centre of the Middle Neolithic. We are learning a lot about the Neolithic settler clans who found this place a suitable site to establish the cultural techniques of agriculture and animal husbandry.”

</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This discovery contributes to the understanding of the Early Neolithic period, a time characterized by the beginning of human settlement and the development of agricultural practices. The findings include pits, holes, and various materials, indicating the lifestyle of early societies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Archaeological teams will continue to study the site to uncover more details about the ancient society and its practices. Further excavations may provide additional insights into the transition from hunting and gathering to agriculture.</p>
