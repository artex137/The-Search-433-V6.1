      <p class="byline">Published 2025-10-04 12:46 UTC</p>

      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Approaches Solar System</h2>
<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has drawn significant global attention as it travels through the solar system at approximately 130,000 mph (219,000 km/h). First detected on July 1, 2025, by the NASA-funded ATLAS survey telescope in Chile, it is the third confirmed interstellar object to enter the solar system.</p>

<p>This discovery offers scientists a rare opportunity to study the chemistry of distant star systems and the building blocks of planets outside our solar system. Space agencies are preparing for close observations and monitoring the comet's trajectory and chemical composition as it continues its journey.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date of detection:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to Mars:</strong> October 3, 2025, approximately 30 million km (18.6 million miles)</li>
    <li><strong>Perihelion:</strong> November 2 to 25, 2025, near Jupiter</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to Earth:</strong> December 2025, at about 1.8 astronomical units (170 million miles)</li>
    <li><strong>Composition:</strong> Water ice, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and dust</li>
    <li><strong>Monitoring agencies:</strong> ESA, NASA</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2025. Following this, it is scheduled to make its closest approach to Mars on October 3, 2025. Between November 2 and 25, 2025, the comet will reach perihelion as it heads towards Jupiter, where it will be closely monitored.</p>
<p>After its perihelion, the comet will approach Earth in December 2025, marking its closest distance before it permanently exits the solar system by March 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This phase offers the best opportunity to measure its chemical composition and compare it with familiar solar system comets,” a report from The Times of India stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is unique among comets due to its hyperbolic trajectory, indicating its origin from beyond the solar system. Its estimated mass of over 33 billion tons makes it larger than previous interstellar objects like ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. The comet’s close approach to Mars presents a significant observation opportunity, particularly as Earth-based telescopes will have limited visibility due to its proximity to the Sun during perihelion.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and ESA will continue to coordinate observations of 3I/ATLAS as it travels through the solar system, utilizing Mars orbiters and the JUICE spacecraft to study its activity until March 2026.</p>
