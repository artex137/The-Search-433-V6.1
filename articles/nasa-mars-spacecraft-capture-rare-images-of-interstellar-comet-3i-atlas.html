      <h2>NASA Mars Spacecraft Capture Rare Images of Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>NASA's Mars spacecraft have captured rare images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it passed through the solar system in early October. The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO), MAVEN (Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN), and the Perseverance rover recorded the comet's features from various distances and perspectives.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it allows scientists to gather unprecedented data on the comet's size, chemical makeup, and behavior as it approaches the Sun. The imagery will enhance understanding of the comet and contribute to research on interstellar objects. The comet is expected to reach its closest approach to Earth on December 19.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was observed on October 2 from 30 million kilometers away.</li>
    <li>MRO captured images at a scale of approximately 30 kilometers per pixel.</li>
    <li>MAVEN took multiple images over 10 days starting September 27.</li>
    <li>Perseverance rover observed the comet on October 4 as a faint smudge.</li>
    <li>The comet will be closest to Earth on December 19.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter observed 3I/ATLAS on October 2. The orbiter's HiRISE camera provided a close-up view from 30 million kilometers away. MAVEN began capturing images of the comet on September 27, using its Imaging Ultraviolet Spectrograph to gather data over a span of 10 days. On October 4, the Perseverance rover detected the comet as a faint smudge through a long exposure with its Mastcam-Z camera.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Observations of interstellar objects are still rare enough that we learn something new on every occasion,” said Shane Byrne, HiRISE principal investigator at the University of Arizona in Tucson.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The images MAVEN captured truly are incredible,” said Shannon Curry, MAVEN’s principal investigator at the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at the University of Colorado Boulder.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Every measurement we make of this comet helps to open up a new understanding of interstellar objects,” said Justin Deighan, MAVEN’s deputy principal investigator.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This observation of 3I/ATLAS is only the third time an interstellar object has been detected in our solar system. Previous interstellar objects have provided valuable insights into the composition and dynamics of celestial bodies beyond our solar system. The ongoing research aims to deepen the understanding of these rare visitors.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further analysis of the collected images and data will continue, focusing on the comet's composition and behavior as it approaches the Sun. Scientists expect to publish findings that enhance knowledge of interstellar objects and their origins.</p>
