      <h2>It’s speaking — Radio echoes detected from 3I/ATLAS and NASA finally reveals its origin</h2>

<p>NASA has detected radio echoes from comet 3I/ATLAS, marking a significant milestone in astronomy. The detection was announced on October 2025 by astronomers using the MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa, where the echoes were first recorded. The comet was located 210 million kilometres from the sun at the time of detection.</p>

<p>This discovery is important as it enhances understanding of interstellar objects and their origins. NASA has stated that the radio echoes likely originate from a star system located in the thick disk of the Milky Way, far from Earth's solar system. This finding has prompted further investigation into the chemical composition of 3I/ATLAS and its potential impact on Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS detected on October 2025.</li>
    <li>First radio echoes recorded by MeerKAT radio telescope, South Africa.</li>
    <li>Distance from the sun during detection: 210 million kilometres.</li>
    <li>Origin of radio echoes believed to be beyond Earth's solar system.</li>
    <li>NASA confirms the comet's coma emits high levels of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide.</li>
    <li>Prior detection attempt failed a month before successful recording.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, astronomers at the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System first detected the object that would be confirmed as comet 3I/ATLAS. Following this, on October 2025, astronomers at the MeerKAT radio telescope announced the successful detection of radio echoes from the comet.</p>
<p>The detection was significant because it came after previous unsuccessful attempts to capture the radio signals from 3I/ATLAS. NASA has since investigated the origin of these echoes and concluded they likely come from a distant star system in the Milky Way.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The origin of the radio echoes is most probably beyond Earth’s solar system,” NASA stated in their report.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “Humans will be pleased to know that they are not in any danger because the comet is not expected to ever pass through Earth’s solar system,” NASA added.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This detection is particularly noteworthy as it represents one of only three known objects with interstellar origins. The success of the MeerKAT radio telescope highlights the growing capabilities of astronomical research, even in countries with fewer resources.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Nasa plans to continue monitoring 3I/ATLAS to gather more data on how comets behave when interacting with Earth's solar system. The findings may lead to advancements in understanding the chemical compositions of similar celestial objects.</p>
