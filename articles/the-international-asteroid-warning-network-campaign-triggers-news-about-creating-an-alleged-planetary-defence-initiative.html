      <h2>The International Asteroid Warning Network Campaign Triggers News About Creating an Alleged Planetary Defence Initiative</h2>

<p>NASA's planetary defence group has started efforts to target the interstellar object 3I/Atlas after astronomers observed unusual behaviours and emissions. The International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) has included 3I/Atlas, which is the size of Manhattan, in its list of potential threats due to beliefs that it may contain alien technology. The campaign will begin on 27 November 2025 and conclude on 27 January 2026.</p>

<p>This initiative is significant as it aims to improve the accuracy of astrometric measurements of comets, which present unique challenges for scientists. IAWN, a coalition supported by NASA, works to monitor potentially dangerous asteroids and Near-Earth Objects. The campaign will enhance the scientific community's capability to gather accurate data on celestial objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Campaign duration: 27 November 2025 to 27 January 2026</li>
    <li>Interstellar object size: approximately the size of Manhattan</li>
    <li>Predicted closest approach to Earth: 19 December 2025</li>
    <li>Registration deadline for workshop: 7 November 2025</li>
    <li>IAWN has been planning this campaign since 2024</li>
    <li>Ongoing US government shutdown since 1 October 2023</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas became visible to astronomers in July 2025, capturing significant attention due to its unusual characteristics. On 21 October 2025, IAWN released an electronic circular announcing the upcoming campaign focused on this interstellar object. The campaign aims to improve astrometric measurements in preparation for its closest approach to Earth on 19 December 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Comets present unique challenges for accurate astrometric measurements and orbit predictions,” IAWN stated in its notice for the campaign.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “Studying the object ahead of its approach is crucial in order to understand its nature and prepare for what its passage may reveal,” said Dr Avi Loeb, founding director of Harvard University's Black Hole Initiative.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The IAWN bulletin has sparked discussions about NASA's involvement in a 'planetary defence' initiative related to 3I/Atlas. However, reports indicate that the ongoing US government shutdown may hinder NASA's ability to launch any such initiative. IAWN has conducted similar observing exercises roughly once a year since 2017.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Participants interested in the campaign must register for a workshop by 7 November 2025. Following this, the campaign will commence as planned, despite the current operational pause at NASA due to the government shutdown.</p>
