      <h2>NASA to Reveal Stunning New Images of 3I/ATLAS — Is the Interstellar Comet Intact?</h2>

<p>NASA will livestream images of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS on Wednesday, November 19, 2025, at 15:00 EST (20:00 SAST) from its various platforms, including NASA's website and YouTube. The event aims to confirm whether the comet remains intact following its close encounter with the Sun, which occurred at a distance of 0.25 AU (37 million km).</p>

<p>The livestream is significant as it may provide definitive answers regarding the structure of 3I/ATLAS, which has been travelling at approximately 84 km/s relative to the Sun. Scientists hope the high-resolution images will clarify whether the comet has survived the Sun's intense heat or if it has fragmented, a possibility that has raised questions among researchers.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Event:</strong> NASA livestream on 3I/ATLAS</li>
  <li><strong>Date:</strong> November 19, 2025</li>
  <li><strong>Time:</strong> 15:00 EST / 20:00 SAST</li>
  <li><strong>Distance from Sun:</strong> 0.25 AU (37 million km)</li>
  <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Approximately 84 km/s</li>
  <li><strong>Diameter of nucleus:</strong> Estimated at 1 km</li>
  <li><strong>Previous discovery:</strong> July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope network in Chile</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope network in Chile. Since then, scientists have monitored its trajectory and behaviour as it approached the Sun, which raised concerns about its structural integrity. Observations have suggested that the comet's nucleus may be stable, but definitive confirmation is anticipated from the upcoming livestream.</p>

<p>NASA has stated that the newly processed images will provide the best chance yet for researchers to analyse the comet's structure. Astrophysicist Avi Loeb has expressed optimism regarding the comet's condition, stating that current observations indicate it remains a single, stable body.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
  "Our latest observations suggest 3I/ATLAS is a single, stable body with no signs of splitting," said Avi Loeb, an astrophysicist. "For scientists and enthusiasts alike, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. We are witnessing an object from another star system in real time."
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object ever recorded, following 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Its hyperbolic orbit confirms it originated from outside the Solar System and will exit at speeds exceeding 100 km/s. The unique composition of its coma, dominated by carbon dioxide, suggests it formed in a chemically distinct environment billions of years ago.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following the livestream, NASA plans to release downloadable high-resolution images for further analysis by astronomers and enthusiasts. These images may answer critical questions regarding the comet's acceleration, stability, and comparison with other interstellar visitors.</p>
