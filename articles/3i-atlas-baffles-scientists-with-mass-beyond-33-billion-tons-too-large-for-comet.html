      <h2>3I/ATLAS baffles scientists with mass beyond 33 billion tons, too large for comet</h2>

<p>A mysterious interstellar object, 3I/ATLAS, has surprised astronomers with its mass, which has been determined to exceed <strong>33 billion tons</strong>. This finding emerged from a recent study conducted by Harvard astrophysicist <strong>Avi Loeb</strong> in collaboration with researchers <strong>Richard Cloete</strong> and <strong>Peter Veres</strong>. The study indicates that the mass of 3I/ATLAS is significantly larger than previously anticipated, ruling out the possibility of it being a comet.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it raises questions about the true nature of 3I/ATLAS. According to Loeb, the data suggests that the object may be an alien probe or artifact from an advanced extraterrestrial civilization. The team analyzed the object's trajectory between <strong>May 15 and September 23, 2025</strong>, to arrive at their conclusions.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Mass:</strong> Greater than 33 billion tons</li>
    <li><strong>Study Period:</strong> May 15 to September 23, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Diameter of Nucleus:</strong> Larger than 3.1 miles</li>
    <li><strong>Previous Discoveries:</strong> 1I/'Oumuamua (2017), 2I/Borisov (2019)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered by astronomers on <strong>July 1, 2025</strong>. Since then, it has become a focal point of discussion within the scientific community. The recent study conducted by Loeb and his colleagues provided new insights into the object's mass and trajectory.</p>
<p>The team studied 3I/ATLAS from mid-May to late September 2025, leading to the conclusion that the object's mass is far beyond that of typical interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Is 3I/ATLAS an unusually massive comet with an unusual chemical composition on an unusually rare trajectory or alien technology?” said Loeb. “In both cases, the object could shed CO2 and H2O ices from material that collected on its frozen surface as it ploughed through interplanetary and interstellar space.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The study of 3I/ATLAS adds to the growing body of research on interstellar objects. Previous discoveries, such as 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have already sparked interest and debate regarding the origins and characteristics of such celestial bodies. The unusual mass of 3I/ATLAS further complicates the understanding of natural versus artificial objects in space.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further research is needed to investigate the chemical composition and true nature of 3I/ATLAS. Scientists aim to gather more data as the object continues its trajectory towards the solar system.</p>
