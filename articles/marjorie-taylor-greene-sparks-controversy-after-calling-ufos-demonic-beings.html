      <h2>Marjorie Taylor Greene Sparks Controversy After Calling UFOs 'Demonic Beings'</h2>

<p>US Congresswoman <strong>Marjorie Taylor Greene</strong> has sparked controversy after suggesting that unidentified flying objects (UFOs) may be 'fallen angels' rather than alien spacecraft during an appearance on <strong>Real Time with Bill Maher</strong> on 1 November 2023. Greene, a Republican from Georgia, claimed that demons are real and accused parts of the US government of concealing the truth about UFOs.</p>

<p>Greene's comments have drawn attention due to their departure from mainstream scientific explanations for unidentified aerial phenomena. Authorities including NASA and the Pentagon have focused on scientific investigations rather than supernatural theories. Greene's remarks illustrate a growing intersection of politics, religion, and conspiracy in the ongoing debate about UFOs in the United States.</p>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 1 November 2023, Marjorie Taylor Greene appeared on the HBO program <strong>Real Time with Bill Maher</strong>. During the episode, she was asked about her belief in demons, to which she affirmed her Christian beliefs, stating, "Absolutely. I'm a Bible-believing Christian." She suggested that UFOs could be classified as fallen angels, stating, "That's possible. I think that's what they could be."</p>

<p>Greene's discussion included references to claims made by senior US military officials regarding UFOs possibly being demonic. She did not challenge these theories. Additionally, she addressed past social media posts linking wildfires to space lasers, claiming ignorance regarding the backgrounds of some parties mentioned.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I believe those could be fallen angels.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“That’s possible. I think that’s what they could be. That’s what makes sense in my worldview.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Greene's remarks are part of a broader pattern of controversial statements she has made, including previous claims about government cover-ups and conspiracy theories. Critics have noted that her willingness to merge theology with theories about extraterrestrial life is unusual for a sitting member of Congress.</p>

<p>The public's fascination with UFOs has increased, with over <strong>30,000 reported sightings</strong> recorded by the popular tracking app Enigma since 2022. This surge has prompted calls for deeper scientific investigation into the phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As public interest in UFOs continues to grow, discussions around Greene's remarks may influence future debates on the intersection of science, religion, and government transparency. Investigations by authorities such as NASA and the Pentagon are expected to continue, focusing on scientific explanations for unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>
