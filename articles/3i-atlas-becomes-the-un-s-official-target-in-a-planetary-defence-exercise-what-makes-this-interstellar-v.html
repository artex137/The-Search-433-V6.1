      <p class="byline">Published 2025-11-27 09:54 UTC</p>

      <h2>3I/ATLAS becomes the UN’s official target in a planetary-defence exercise</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has been designated as the focus of a planetary-defence exercise by the United Nations and the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN). The exercise is part of a coordinated global initiative that began on 27 November 2025 and will run until 27 January 2026, allowing experts to test observation techniques and improve readiness against potential threats from Near-Earth Objects (NEOs).</p>

<p>This exercise matters because it enhances global preparedness for celestial threats. The campaign aims to refine tracking methods and improve international coordination in response to potential NEOs. The initiative has garnered significant attention from scientists and the public due to its scientific implications and the importance of planetary defence.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet discovered on 1 July 2025 by the ATLAS telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>Official observation window: 27 November 2025 to 27 January 2026.</li>
    <li>Registration deadline: 7 November 2025, 17:00 UTC.</li>
    <li>Kick-off notification: 25 November 2025.</li>
    <li>Mid-campaign check-in: 9 December 2025, 15:00 UTC.</li>
    <li>Close-out teleconference: 3 February 2026, 15:00 UTC.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The IAWN has announced a structured schedule for the 3I/ATLAS observation campaign:</p>
<ul>
    <li>**7 November 2025**: Registration deadline for participating observatories.</li>
    <li>**10 November 2025**: Comet astrometry workshop to align observation techniques.</li>
    <li>**25 November 2025**: Kick-off notification for the campaign.</li>
    <li>**27 November 2025**: Observing window officially opens.</li>
    <li>**9 December 2025**: Mid-campaign check-in to assess progress.</li>
    <li>**27 January 2026**: Observing window closes.</li>
    <li>**3 February 2026**: Close-out teleconference for final discussions and analysis.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “While 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth, it presents a unique opportunity for IAWN to conduct a practical observing exercise due to its visibility and scientific significance,” officials have stated.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The 3I/ATLAS observation exercise is the eighth IAWN observing initiative, part of a multi-year effort to enhance global preparedness against NEOs. The comet is only the third confirmed interstellar object to pass through the Solar System, making its study significant for future planetary-defence strategies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following the close-out teleconference on 3 February 2026, participants will analyze the collected data and refine their methodologies for future NEO threats. The exercise aims to strengthen international collaboration in planetary defence.</p>
