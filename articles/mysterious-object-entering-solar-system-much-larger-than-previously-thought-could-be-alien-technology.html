      <h2>Mysterious object entering solar system much larger than previously thought, could be ‘alien technology’</h2>

<p>A massive comet named 3I/ATLAS is traveling through the solar system and is significantly larger than previously estimated, according to a new report. The object, confirmed by NASA’s Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System, is an interstellar object—the third of its kind ever detected—first identified in July 2025.</p>

<p>This discovery raises questions about the origins of 3I/ATLAS, with some scientists suggesting it could be a remnant of alien technology. Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb and his team have stated that the mass of ATLAS “must be bigger than 33 billion tons” and that its nucleus is larger than 3.1 miles. NASA reports that the comet poses no danger to Earth, as it will remain approximately 150 million miles away.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Identified: July 2025 by NASA</li>
    <li>Mass: Greater than 33 billion tons</li>
    <li>Nucleus size: Larger than 3.1 miles</li>
    <li>Speed: Approximately 152,000 mph</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth: About 150 million miles</li>
    <li>Closest approach: 1.67 million miles from Mars’ orbit</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified in July 2025 by NASA’s Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System. Since then, scientists, including Avi Loeb, have studied the comet and released findings detailing its unusual characteristics and potential implications.</p>

<p>Loeb's team has noted the comet is shedding significant amounts of carbon dioxide and dust as it approaches the sun, leading to further analysis of its mass and trajectory.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “This suggests that 3I/ATLAS is more massive than the other two interstellar objects, 1I/`Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov by 3–5 orders of magnitude, constituting a major anomaly,” said Avi Loeb in a blog post.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “A future detection of a major maneuver of 3I/ATLAS would suggest propulsion by a technologically manufactured engine,” Loeb added in an earlier paper.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object detected, following Comet 2I/Borisov in 2019 and ‘Oumuamua in 2017. These previous detections have sparked ongoing discussions in the scientific community regarding the nature of interstellar objects and their potential origins.</p>

<p>The study of 3I/ATLAS could provide new insights into the composition and behavior of objects from outside our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the sun, with further observations planned to gather data on its trajectory and composition. Investigations into its origins and characteristics are ongoing.</p>
