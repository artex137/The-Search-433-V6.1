      <h2>3I/ATLAS is picking up speed, turning blue, and the size of Manhattan</h2>

<p>The comet 3I/ATLAS has gained speed and size, now comparable to Manhattan, as it approaches Earth. The comet is expected to reach its closest point to the planet on March 2, 2024.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it presents a rare opportunity for astronomers to study the comet's characteristics and behavior. Authorities are preparing for increased visibility of the comet in the night sky, which could attract the interest of both amateur and professional astronomers.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is now the size of Manhattan.</li>
    <li>It is expected to reach its closest approach to Earth on March 2, 2024.</li>
    <li>The comet has increased in speed recently.</li>
    <li>It is turning blue, indicating changes in its composition.</li>
    <li>This event will provide astronomers with a valuable opportunity to observe its characteristics.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has been gaining speed and size over recent months. As of the current date, it has reached dimensions comparable to Manhattan and is exhibiting a blue hue. Its closest approach to Earth is scheduled for March 2, 2024.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This comet presents a unique opportunity for observation and study,” said an unnamed astronomer. “Its rapid changes could provide insights into its composition and behavior.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has been observed since its discovery and has shown significant changes in speed and size. Such phenomena are not uncommon among comets, which often experience fluctuations as they approach the sun.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the comet approaches, astronomers plan to intensify their observations and public outreach to encourage interest in the event.</p>
