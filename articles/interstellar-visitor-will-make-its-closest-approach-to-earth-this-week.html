      <h2>Interstellar visitor will make its closest approach to Earth this week</h2>

<p>A comet from another star, known as 3I/Atlas, will make its closest approach to Earth on Friday, passing within 167 million miles (269 million kilometers) of the planet. Discovered in July, this comet is currently on its grand tour of the solar system before it races back toward interstellar space.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it marks the third known interstellar comet to pass through our solar system. NASA is actively observing 3I/Atlas, and backyard astronomers are encouraged to view the comet before it fades from sight. According to Acting NASA Administrator Sean Duffy, the comet poses no threat to Earth and offers a unique opportunity for scientific study.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/Atlas</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach:</strong> 167 million miles (269 million kilometers) from Earth</li>
    <li><strong>Date of Closest Approach:</strong> Friday</li>
    <li><strong>Estimated Size:</strong> Between 440 meters (1,444 feet) and 5.6 kilometers (3.5 miles)</li>
    <li><strong>Next Close Approach:</strong> 33 million miles (53 million kilometers) to Jupiter in March</li>
    <li><strong>Origin:</strong> Likely from an older star system</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>NASA's ATLAS telescope in Chile discovered comet 3I/Atlas in July while searching for potentially hazardous asteroids. In 2017, the first confirmed interstellar visitor was detected by a telescope in Hawaii. Two years later, another interstellar comet was identified by an amateur astronomer in Crimea. 3I/Atlas is now making its closest approach to Earth this week.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“NASA’s observations show that this is the third interstellar comet to pass through our solar system. No aliens. No threat to life here on Earth,” said Sean Duffy, Acting NASA Administrator.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“3 = the third, I = interstellar, meaning from beyond our solar system, ATLAS = discovered by our Asteroid Terrestrial-Impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) team,” Duffy added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interstellar comets like 3I/Atlas originate from star systems outside of our own, in contrast to home-grown comets such as Halley's Comet, which comes from the icy outskirts of our solar system. The study of these interstellar objects provides insights into the formation of stars and planetary systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following its closest approach, 3I/Atlas will continue its journey out of the solar system, with no plans for return. NASA will continue to monitor the comet until it becomes too faint to observe.</p>
