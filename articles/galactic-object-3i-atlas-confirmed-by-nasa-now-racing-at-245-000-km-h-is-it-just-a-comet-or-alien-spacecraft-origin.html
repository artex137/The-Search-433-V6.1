      <h2>Galactic Object 3I/ATLAS Confirmed by NASA, Now Racing at 245,000 KM/H</h2>

<p>A rare interstellar object, designated 3I/ATLAS, has been confirmed by NASA as it travels through our solar system at an estimated speed of 60 kilometers per second (approximately 245,000 km/h). Discovered in late June by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS), the object is currently about 416 million miles from the Sun and is expected to make its closest approach on 30 October, passing just inside the orbit of Mars.</p>

<p>This confirmation marks only the third known interstellar object to be recorded, following the famous ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. The unique status of 3I/ATLAS is significant for planetary science, as it provides scientists with a rare opportunity to study material from beyond our solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Object Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
  <li><strong>Speed:</strong> 60 kilometers per second (245,000 km/h)</li>
  <li><strong>Distance from Sun:</strong> 416 million miles as of early July</li>
  <li><strong>Closest Approach (Perihelion):</strong> 30 October, 1.4 astronomical units (AU) from the Sun</li>
  <li><strong>Minimum Distance from Earth:</strong> 1.6 AU (approximately 240 million kilometers)</li>
  <li><strong>Initial Discovery:</strong> Late June by ATLAS</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The discovery and classification of 3I/ATLAS have unfolded as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Late June 2023: 3I/ATLAS is discovered by ATLAS.</li>
  <li>July 2023: NASA and the International Astronomical Union (IAU) confirm the object's interstellar status and reclassify it as 3I/ATLAS.</li>
  <li>30 October 2023: The object is projected to make its closest approach to the Sun.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“There are reports that it shows a small comet-like tail, so that implies a lot of the brightness will be from the coma,” said Prof. Colin Snodgrass, planetary astronomer at the University of Edinburgh.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“As it gets closer, it’s expected to brighten,” said Dr. Mark Norris, senior lecturer in astronomy at the University of Central Lancashire.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object, highlighting the rarity of such cosmic visitors. Previous objects, ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have drawn significant scientific interest for their unique characteristics. A 2022 study estimated that as many as one interstellar object could traverse the inner solar system each year, most of which are too small or faint for current detection methods.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches the Sun, it will become obscured by its glare in late September, limiting observations temporarily. It is expected to reappear in December, allowing for further study by ground- and space-based telescopes, including the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and the James Webb Space Telescope.</p>
