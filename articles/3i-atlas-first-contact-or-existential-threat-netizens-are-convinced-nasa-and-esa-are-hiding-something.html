      <h2>3I/Atlas, 'first contact or existential threat'? Netizens are convinced NASA and ESA are hiding something</h2>

<p>NASA's Mars Perseverance rover has captured a photo of the interstellar object 3I/Atlas, raising speculation about its nature among netizens and astronomy enthusiasts. The photo shows 3I/Atlas as a perfect white cylinder soaring above Mars, but no further observations have been released by NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), or China's space agency since the object's flyby on August 27, 2025.</p>

<p>The lack of official commentary and additional imagery has fueled theories that 3I/Atlas may not be a comet but rather a piece of alien technology. Scientists and the public are now questioning what, if anything, the space agencies have observed. The situation has sparked widespread discussion on social media about the implications of the object and the silence from authorities.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/Atlas was discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>The object flew by Mars on August 27, 2025.</li>
    <li>NASA's Perseverance rover took a photo of 3I/Atlas shortly before the flyby.</li>
    <li>3I/Atlas is estimated to move at a speed of 60,000 km/sec (220,000 km/hour).</li>
    <li>Its size is debated, with estimates ranging from 1 kilometre to 46 kilometres in diameter.</li>
    <li>3I/Atlas has a mass estimated at 33 billion tonnes, according to Harvard scientist Avi Loeb.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas was officially discovered on July 1, 2025. Following its discovery, it approached Mars, where it flew by the planet on August 27, 2025. During this time, NASA's Perseverance rover captured a single photo of the object, which has since generated significant public interest and speculation. As of now, no further images or data have been released by NASA, ESA, or China's space agency.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The newest and closest of 3I/Atlas as it passes Mars right this moment, minutes ago. It's not a comet...it's perfectly cylindrical. It's an interstellar craft of some kind,” a user wrote on X, referencing images taken by the Perseverance rover.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “Only NASA and ESA have Mars Orbiter images and videos of 3I/ATLAS, and they classify them again as TOP SECRET. The public has no access to any official image of 3I/ATLAS since August 27, 2025,” another user commented.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas is the third interstellar object detected by humans. Its trajectory indicates it is traveling from outside the solar system, a characteristic that sets it apart from typical comets. The object's unusual shape and speed have led to speculation about its origins and purpose, particularly in light of its potential implications for humanity.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As discussions continue, there is no indication of when or if NASA, ESA, or China's space agency will release additional information about 3I/Atlas. The scientific community and the public await further developments regarding this intriguing interstellar object.</p>
