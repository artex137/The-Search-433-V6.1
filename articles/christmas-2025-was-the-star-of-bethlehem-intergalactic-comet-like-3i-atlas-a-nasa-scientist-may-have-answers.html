      <h2>Christmas 2025: Was The ‘Star Of Bethlehem’ Intergalactic Comet Like 3I/ATLAS? A NASA Scientist May Have Answers</h2>

<p>A NASA scientist has proposed that the ‘Star of Bethlehem’ may have been an intergalactic comet similar to 3I/ATLAS, according to a paper published on December 9, 2025. The study, authored by Mark Matney, suggests that a comet could explain the celestial phenomenon described in the biblical account of the Magi visiting Jesus. Matney's research offers a new perspective on the astronomical events surrounding the birth of Jesus, based on historical records and numerical analysis.</p>

<p>This research matters because it provides a scientifically-grounded explanation for a long-debated topic. Authorities in the field of astronomy have expressed interest in Matney's findings, which could influence both scientific discourse and theological interpretations of the biblical text. The study introduces a comet candidate that aligns with the timeline of the events recorded in the Gospel of Matthew.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Publication date: December 9, 2025</li>
    <li>Author: Mark Matney, NASA scientist</li>
    <li>Paper published in: British Astronomical Association</li>
    <li>Key astronomical events considered: Comet sightings in 5 BCE</li>
    <li>Historical context: The Magi's journey to Bethlehem</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In the early 20th century, astronomy professors like Dr. Karlis Kaufmanis explored various astronomical events that could represent the 'Star of Bethlehem'. These included planetary conjunctions and supernovae. In 2019, the comet 2I/Borisov was discovered, followed by the identification of 3I/ATLAS in 2025. Mark Matney’s recent paper offers a new candidate for the star, suggesting its orbit could have matched the description in the biblical text.</p>

<p>The study analyzes historical Chinese records from 5 BCE that document a comet, proposing that this could have been the celestial object guiding the Magi. Matney’s findings indicate the comet exhibited 'temporary geosynchronous' motion, aligning with the biblical narrative where the star 'went before' the Magi.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This study introduces a comet candidate that could have had apparent motion corresponding to the description in Matthew,” said Mark Matney in his paper.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The Magi may have been influenced by ancient beliefs about comets, as described in Greco-Roman astrological writings,” Matney added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The concept of the Star of Bethlehem has long intrigued scholars and theologians. Past theories have included supernovae and the alignment of planets. The identification of intergalactic comets like 1I/Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov has shifted the focus of some researchers toward the possibility of these celestial events being linked to biblical occurrences.</p>

<p>Matney's work represents a significant development in this ongoing discourse, as it aims to bridge scientific inquiry with historical and religious texts.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Mark Matney’s paper is open access, allowing further examination by both scientists and theologians. Future discussions and research may build on his findings, potentially leading to new insights into the intersection of astronomy and biblical history.</p>
