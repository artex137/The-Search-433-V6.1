      <h2>Video Shared At Congressional Hearing Appears To Show Hellfire Missile Bouncing Off Orb-Shaped UFO</h2>

<p>A video presented at a Congressional hearing on UFO transparency this week shows a Hellfire missile appearing to bounce off an orb-shaped UFO. The missile was fired from a U.S. military drone off the coast of Yemen on October 30, 2024. The footage was reportedly shared with the Congressional task force by a whistleblower.</p>

<p>This video has raised questions about the U.S. government's transparency regarding unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs). Authorities are now under pressure to disclose more information about such incidents, as lawmakers seek answers about what the military knows regarding UAPs and the implications for national security.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Incident occurred on October 30, 2024.</li>
    <li>Location: Off the coast of Yemen.</li>
    <li>Weapon used: Hellfire missile launched from an MQ-9 Reaper drone.</li>
    <li>Video shared by Rep. Eric Burlison during a Congressional hearing.</li>
    <li>UAP referred to as an orb-shaped UFO.</li>
    <li>Witnessed by UFO investigator George Knapp during the hearing.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 30, 2024, an MQ-9 Reaper drone tracked an orb-shaped UFO off the coast of Yemen. A second MQ-9 drone launched a Hellfire missile at the object. The missile struck the UFO but appeared ineffective, as the object continued flying despite possible damage.</p>

<p>The video of this incident was presented at a Congressional hearing on September 9, 2025. Rep. Eric Burlison shared the footage, which was made available to the public for the first time. During the hearing, George Knapp confirmed the missile's impact, stating it "bounced right off." He indicated that additional footage exists that Congress has not yet been allowed to view.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “It kept going, and it looked like the debris was taken with it,” said Rep. Eric Burlison regarding the UFO's response to the missile impact.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “That’s a Hellfire missile smacking into that UFO, and bouncing right off – and it kept going,” said UFO investigator George Knapp during the hearing.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “The federal government has been hiding information from Americans for decades,” stated Rep. Anna Paulina Luna. “It is time to give Americans the answers they deserve, which is why I am honored to lead this bipartisan task force that seeks truth and transparency.”
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The term Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) is currently used by the U.S. government to describe what were previously known as Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs). This shift reflects a broader push for transparency regarding aerial encounters. The Congressional hearing is part of ongoing efforts to investigate UAPs, alongside inquiries into other significant historical events and government actions.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the incident and the broader implications of UAPs are expected to continue. Lawmakers aim to push for more transparency from the federal government regarding UAPs and related data. Further hearings may be scheduled to explore these issues in greater detail.</p>
