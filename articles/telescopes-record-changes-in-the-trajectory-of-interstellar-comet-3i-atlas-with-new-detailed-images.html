      <h2>Telescopes record changes in the trajectory of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS with new detailed images</h2>

<p>Astronomers have released new images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, captured by the Telescópio Espacial Hubble on January 7, 2026. The images highlight a notable anti-tail jet, a structure formed by dust released in the opposite direction to the Sun. The comet continues its hyperbolic trajectory through the Solar System and is expected to make a final encounter with Jupiter in March 2026.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as Comet 3I/ATLAS, discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS system, represents the third confirmed interstellar object. Its remote origin, possibly formed about 7 billion years ago around another star, offers a unique opportunity to study primitive materials in the universe. Observations from both ground-based and space-based telescopes reveal changes in the comet’s color and brightness, which scientists track to better understand its composition.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>First detailed images were captured by Hubble in January 2026.</li>
    <li>The comet has an estimated diameter of 600 to 800 meters.</li>
    <li>It is expected to encounter Jupiter in March 2026.</li>
    <li>The comet travels at a speed of approximately 58 km/s.</li>
    <li>Observations indicate a deviation of four arc seconds from its predicted trajectory.</li>
    <li>Images show changes from reddish tones to deep blue in the comet’s color.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the ATLAS monitoring system detected Comet 3I/ATLAS as it entered the inner Solar System. Within weeks, astronomers confirmed its interstellar trajectory. The comet made a close approach to Earth on December 18, 2025, at a safe distance of millions of kilometers. Observations continued, leading to detailed imaging by the Hubble Space Telescope in January 2026.</p>

<p>Notable images from the Gemini North telescope in Hawaii were recorded on November 26, 2025, showing the nucleus surrounded by a luminous coma. The Europa Clipper probe captured an image from 164 million kilometers away on November 6, 2025, highlighting the separation of blue-green gas and red dust in the coma.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The changes in brightness and color of Comet 3I/ATLAS provide valuable insights into its composition and activity,” said an astronomer involved in the study.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third cataloged interstellar object, following ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Unlike ʻOumuamua, which did not exhibit a coma, 3I/ATLAS behaves like a classic comet indicating evident activity. Comparatively, it has a greater estimated age and higher speed than 2I/Borisov. Each interstellar visitor offers a unique chemical signature from its original formation, contributing to the understanding of objects ejected from other stellar systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Global observatories will maintain continuous monitoring of Comet 3I/ATLAS until it becomes indistinguishable. The data collected will serve as a reference for future interstellar detections and enhance models of planetary formation in exosystems.</p>
