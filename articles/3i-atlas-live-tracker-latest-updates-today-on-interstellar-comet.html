      <h2>3I/ATLAS Live Tracker: Latest updates today on interstellar comet</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, discovered on July 1, 2023, by the ATLAS observatory in Chile, has become a focal point for scientists and astronomers around the world. It recently reached perihelion on October 29, 2023, and is currently at solar conjunction, making it temporarily invisible due to the Sun's glare. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this astronomical event.</p>

<p>This comet is significant as it provides a rare opportunity for scientists to study an object from outside our solar system. Authorities, including NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA), are closely monitoring its trajectory and characteristics to enhance our understanding of interstellar objects. As it is expected to reappear in early November, researchers are preparing to gather more data on its composition and behavior.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> July 1, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Location of Discovery:</strong> ATLAS observatory, Chile</li>
    <li><strong>Perihelion Date:</strong> October 29, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to Earth:</strong> 268 million kilometres on December 19, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> 221,000 km/h (60 km/s)</li>
    <li><strong>Estimated Age:</strong> 7 to 14 billion years</li>
    <li><strong>Size Estimates:</strong> 0.32 to 5.6 km in diameter, with some claims up to 46 km</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2023, by astronomers at the ATLAS observatory in Chile. Initially, its trajectory raised questions about its origins, leading scientists to conclude it was an interstellar visitor. On October 29, the comet reached perihelion, marking a critical phase in its journey as it passed closest to the Sun. Observations indicated that the comet would soon change in appearance as it continues its path through the solar system.</p>

<p>Following its perihelion, scientists expect the comet to re-emerge from behind the Sun in early November, allowing for further study of its characteristics.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The ice will dissipate, and the comet's appearance will change,” said a NASA spokesperson regarding the implications of the comet reaching perihelion.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “The trajectory of 3I/ATLAS was not normal for asteroids and comets that reside in our solar system,” noted a researcher involved in the observations.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is believed to be the oldest comet ever spotted by humans, estimated to be between 7.6 and 14 billion years old, predating the solar system itself. This discovery adds to the significance of studying interstellar objects, which could provide insights into the early formation of celestial bodies.</p>

<p>Previous interstellar visitors, such as 'Oumuamua, have sparked debates about their origins and characteristics. The study of 3I/ATLAS may help clarify some of these discussions.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS is expected to reappear in early November, scientists will continue to monitor its trajectory and characteristics. Further observations will aim to determine any changes in its structure and behavior following its close encounter with the Sun.</p>
