      <h2>Two of NASA's most powerful space telescopes take a closer look at comet 3I/ATLAS, find water and CO2</h2>

<p>NASA's SPHEREx and James Webb Space Telescopes have observed comet 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar comet discovered on 1 July 2025 in Rio Hurtado, Chile. The comet poses no threat to Earth and is currently about 240 million km (150 million miles) away. Observations have revealed the presence of water ice and carbon dioxide in the comet's composition.</p>

<p>These findings are significant as 3I/ATLAS is one of only three known interstellar objects to have entered our Solar System, alongside 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Scientists are racing against time to gather data on this unique object before it exits the Solar System permanently.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on 1 July 2025.</li>
    <li>NASA's SPHEREx observed the comet from 7–15 August 2025.</li>
    <li>James Webb Space Telescope observed the comet on 6 August 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet is approximately 470 million km (290 million miles) from the Sun during observations.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will be visible from Earth until September 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet will reemerge from the Sun's glare in early December 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected on 1 July 2025, during its passage through the Solar System. NASA's SPHEREx conducted observations from 7 to 15 August 2025, identifying carbon dioxide and water ice in the comet. The James Webb Space Telescope followed with its observations on 6 August 2025, confirming the presence of carbon dioxide, water ice, water vapour, carbon monoxide, and carbonyl sulfide.</p>

<p>The comet remains visible until September 2025. After this period, it will be obscured by the Sun but is expected to become visible again in early December 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“SPHEREx was able to make multi-spectral observations of the interstellar comet, providing insight into its chemical composition,” said a mission scientist.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The findings from the James Webb Space Telescope confirm that 3I/ATLAS is rich in carbon dioxide and contains various other compounds,” stated another researcher.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable for being one of the few interstellar objects identified in our Solar System. The earlier objects, 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov, were discovered in 2017 and 2019, respectively. These discoveries have sparked interest in studying the chemical properties and origins of such objects from deep space.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to study comet 3I/ATLAS until its visibility ends in September 2025. Further analysis of the data collected by SPHEREx and the James Webb Space Telescope will provide additional insights into the comet's composition and its implications for understanding the Universe.</p>
