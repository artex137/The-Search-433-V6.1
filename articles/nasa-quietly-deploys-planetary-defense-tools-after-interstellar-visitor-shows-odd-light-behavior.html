      <h2>NASA quietly deploys planetary defense tools after interstellar visitor shows odd light behavior</h2>

<p>NASA has added the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS to the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) list of threats following its unusual behavior, as reported on October 22, 2025. The comet has exhibited strange features that challenge existing comet behavior norms, prompting authorities to take action.</p>

<p>This addition marks 3I/ATLAS as the first interstellar object on the IAWN list, which is a United Nations-endorsed group focused on planetary defense. The IAWN has initiated a global drill to enhance detection capabilities for potential threats from near-Earth objects (NEOs). Officials have noted that the object poses “unique challenges” in predicting its trajectory.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Date of report:</strong> October 22, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Drill duration:</strong> November 27, 2025 - January 27, 2026</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to the Sun:</strong> Within 126 million miles</li>
    <li><strong>Diameter:</strong> More than 28 miles</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery:</strong> James Webb Telescope in August 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Notable feature:</strong> Jet of particles pointing toward the Sun</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>NASA first detected 3I/ATLAS in August 2025 using the James Webb Telescope. The object has since been observed displaying unusual behavior, including an "anti-tail" that challenges conventional comet behavior.</p>
<p>On October 3, 2025, space probes captured images of 3I/ATLAS during its closest pass by Mars, revealing features that suggest it may be a giant cylindrical object composed of nickel.</p>
<p>The IAWN has scheduled a global exercise from November 27, 2025, to January 27, 2026, to improve tracking methods for the object.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“They’re calling it a test of improved astrometry methods. In other words, the object isn’t behaving like it should,”</blockquote>
<p>one observer noted on social media.</p>

<blockquote>“NASA is currently closed due to the ongoing government shutdown and did not comment further,”</blockquote>
<p>an agency spokesperson stated.</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The addition of 3I/ATLAS to the IAWN list highlights growing concerns about the behavior of interstellar objects. This incident follows previous observations of strange activities from celestial bodies, raising questions about their nature and potential risks to Earth.</p>
<p>NASA and other space agencies, including the European Space Agency, collaborate within the IAWN to enhance Earth’s defenses against NEOs.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches the Sun, global telescopes will focus on the object to refine tracking methods. The upcoming drill aims to prepare for any potential impact threats, although NASA has clarified that no rockets will be launched to defend against the object at this time.</p>
