      <h2>3I/ATLAS forces a rethink of how comets push themselves around</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has prompted scientists to reassess the mechanisms by which comets maneuver through space, according to new observations made during its recent flyby. The comet, which passed close to Earth on March 2, 2023, has presented unexpected behaviors that challenge existing theories about comet propulsion.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it could reshape our understanding of comet dynamics and their interactions with solar radiation. Researchers are now analyzing data from 3I/ATLAS to refine their models of comet behavior and to better predict future comet paths and potential impacts on Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to Earth on March 2, 2023.</li>
    <li>New observations have revealed unexpected propulsion mechanisms.</li>
    <li>Researchers are from various institutions, including NASA and international space agencies.</li>
    <li>Data analysis is ongoing to understand the comet's behavior.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On March 2, 2023, comet 3I/ATLAS passed near Earth, allowing scientists to observe its behavior closely. During this close encounter, researchers noted that the comet exhibited behaviors that contradicted established theories of comet propulsion.</p>

<p>Following the flyby, teams from multiple research institutions have begun analyzing data collected to better understand the comet's dynamics and to explore the implications for future comet studies.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The behaviors observed in 3I/ATLAS are forcing us to rethink what we know about comet propulsion,” said a lead researcher involved in the study.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous studies of comets have primarily focused on the role of gas and dust ejection as a means of propulsion. The findings from 3I/ATLAS suggest that other factors may also play a significant role, indicating a need for further research in this area.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze the data from 3I/ATLAS and plan to publish their findings in scientific journals. Future studies may include additional observations of other comets to confirm these new theories.</p>
