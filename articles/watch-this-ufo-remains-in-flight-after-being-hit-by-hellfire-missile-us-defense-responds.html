      <h2>UFO remains in flight after being hit by Hellfire missile: US Defense responds</h2>

<p>During a congressional hearing on September 9, U.S. Representative Eric Burlison presented footage of an unidentified flying object (UFO) that continued to fly after being struck by a Hellfire missile. The video was reportedly captured by an MQ-9 Reaper drone off the coast of Yemen on October 30, 2024. There were no reported injuries or fatalities from the incident.</p>

<p>This event highlights ongoing investigations into unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) and aims to promote government transparency. The hearing, conducted by a working group overseeing UAP investigations, has raised questions about the nature of such objects and why information has not been publicly disclosed. The U.S. Department of Defense has not provided additional details regarding the video.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>

    <li>Date of hearing: September 9, 2024</li>
    <li>Date of UFO incident: October 30, 2024</li>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 30, 2024, an MQ-9 Reaper drone captured footage of a high-speed object flying in a straight line. The drone launched a Hellfire missile at the object, which appeared to remain intact and continued on its trajectory despite the impact. On September 9, 2024, during a congressional hearing, U.S. Representative Eric Burlison showed this footage to the public for the first time.</p>

<p>During the hearing, Burlison emphasized the significance of the footage, stating that it speaks for itself. Investigative journalist George Knapp, who was also present, expressed surprise at the object's resilience after being struck by the missile.</p>

    “No explanation is needed—you will see it with your own eyes... You can still see it continuing to fly.”

<blockquote>
    “That's a Hellfire missile hitting a UFO and bouncing off. The target kept going... What the hell is that?”

<blockquote>
    “We have no information to provide on this.”

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Pentagon's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) was established to investigate UAP reports from military personnel. While some incidents have been explained, many remain unresolved. This hearing is part of a broader effort to increase transparency regarding UAP and the government's response to these phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further investigations into the incident are expected as the AARO continues to review cases involving UAP. The lack of public information on UFOs raises questions about future disclosures and the government's treatment of such phenomena.</p>
