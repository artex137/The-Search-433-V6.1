      <h2>NASA detects mysterious comet 'not from our solar system'</h2>

<p>NASA has detected a comet named 3I/ATLAS, which experts believe originates from outside our solar system. The comet's discovery has sparked interest and speculation about its origins and implications. There have been no reports of injuries or fatalities related to this discovery.</p>

<p>The detection of 3I/ATLAS is significant as it marks one of only three confirmed interstellar objects. Experts are examining the comet to understand its composition and potential origins, which could be from a planetary system billions of years old. Qicheng Zhang, a postdoctoral fellow at Lowell Observatory, has highlighted the comet's unique characteristics, including its outgassing and dust production.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object name: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Type: Interstellar comet</li>
    <li>Confirmed interstellar objects: Three</li>
    <li>Expert: Qicheng Zhang, Lowell Observatory</li>
    <li>Recent UK space launch: Skylark rockets, first in 50 years</li>
    <li>Launch altitude: 62 miles</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been identified as an interstellar comet, with experts confirming its unique characteristics. The comet is currently being studied to determine its origins and composition. In the UK, the government has made strides in the space sector, launching Skylark rockets for the first time in 50 years.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This comet in particular is interesting since it's actually from outside of our solar system,” said Qicheng Zhang. “In this case, it's an interstellar comet because we can actually see it outgassing and producing dust.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Mike Kane, aviation and space minister, stated, “I am thrilled we’ve reached this important milestone in the UK space sector, and I congratulate Skyrora for being the first UK company to receive a rocket launch licence.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Rob Bishton, chief executive of the CAA, added, “Granting a home-grown company, Skyrora, its launch licence is a major milestone for our space sector and our nation.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS follows the UK’s recent advancements in space exploration, including the launch of Skylark rockets. These developments highlight the growing interest and investment in the space sector, as countries aim to enhance their capabilities in scientific innovation and exploration.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Experts will continue to study 3I/ATLAS to gather more information about its origins and characteristics. The UK space sector is expected to grow further following the successful launch of Skylark rockets, with more developments anticipated in the near future.</p>
