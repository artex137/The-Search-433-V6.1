      <h2>3I/ATLAS 'Dead Rock Comes to Life': Interstellar Visitor Stuns Scientists With Violent Eruption Activity</h2>

<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has surprised scientists with violent explosive activity as it travels through the inner Solar System. Telescopes in Spain have observed the comet erupting with what researchers describe as "ice volcanoes," releasing frozen gas and dust into space. This activity has sparked a debate among geologists and those searching for signs of extraterrestrial technology.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant because it challenges existing theories about comet formation. Scientists are currently investigating the implications of this activity and gathering data, as 3I/ATLAS is a rare specimen that could provide insights into the origins of our Solar System.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is travelling at 137,000 mph.</li>
    <li>The comet will reach its closest point to Earth on 19 December, approximately 270 million kilometres away.</li>
    <li>It made its closest approach to the Sun on 29 October.</li>
    <li>The Joan Oró Telescope at Montsec Observatory in Spain has been tracking the comet's activity.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object after 'Oumuamua and Borisov.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 29 October, 3I/ATLAS reached its closest point to the Sun, which triggered a significant increase in activity. The comet brightened and jets of gas and dust became visible, as captured by the Joan Oró Telescope. This event marked the beginning of a series of eruptions that have intrigued scientists.</p>

<p>As the comet continues its journey, researchers are working to capture as much data as possible before it moves out of reach. The activity observed has raised questions about the nature of these eruptions and their implications for our understanding of cometary bodies.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “We were all surprised,” said Josep Trigo-Rodríguez, the lead researcher at Spain's Institute of Space Sciences. “Being a comet formed in a remote planetary system, it is remarkable that [it resembles] bodies belonging to our planetary system.”
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable for its pristine condition, as it has not been near a star for an extremely long time, making it a valuable time capsule from another solar system. Previous interstellar objects, such as 'Oumuamua and Borisov, have provided insights into the diversity of materials found in the universe, but 3I/ATLAS presents a unique opportunity due to its explosive activity.</p>

<p>The research suggests that the comet's eruptions could challenge and refine our understanding of planetary-system formation. The findings indicate that comets may form under varying conditions depending on their solar systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth. Observatories worldwide, including Hubble and Mars orbiters, are gathering data at an accelerated pace. Researchers aim to determine whether the observed jets are a result of natural processes or indicate something previously unseen.</p>
