      <h2>Could We Probe an Interstellar Object Before It Zips Out of the Solar System?</h2>

<p>In June, scientists confirmed the discovery of 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar object, as it traveled through the inner solar system. This object is the third such entity detected from outside our solar system. The discovery has prompted researchers to explore potential missions to study it up close before it exits the solar system.</p>

<p>The Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) has developed a mission study that outlines how a spacecraft could conduct a flyby of interstellar objects. Although it is too late to intercept 3I/ATLAS, scientists have used its observed properties to prepare for future missions. “The trajectory of 3I/ATLAS is within the interceptable range of the mission we designed,” said SwRI project manager Matthew Freeman. “The proposed mission would be a high-speed, head-on flyby that would collect a large amount of valuable data.”</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>First spotted:</strong> June 25-29, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Confirmed as interstellar:</strong> July 2, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to Mars:</strong> October 3, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Mars at closest approach:</strong> 18.6 million miles (30 million kilometers)</li>
    <li><strong>Agencies involved:</strong> Southwest Research Institute, NASA, European Space Agency</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in late June 2023. Following its observation, the International Astronomical Union's Minor Planet Center confirmed its interstellar origin on July 2, marking it as the third interstellar object discovered. The object is projected to make a close flyby of Mars on October 3, 2023, where the European Space Agency plans to observe it with existing spacecraft.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“These new kinds of objects offer humankind the first feasible opportunity to closely explore bodies formed in other star systems,” said Alan Stern, associate vice president of SwRI. “An [interstellar comet] flyby could give unprecedented insights into the composition, structure and properties of these objects.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I/ATLAS, the first known interstellar object, ‘Oumuamua, was detected in October 2017. The second, 2I/Borisov, was discovered in 2019. Researchers estimate many more interstellar objects pass through the solar system annually, and advancements in astronomical technology, such as the Vera Rubin observatory, may enhance detection capabilities.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Mars, the European Space Agency will utilize its orbiting spacecraft to observe the object and gather data, despite the challenges posed by its distance.</p>
