      <h2>3I/ATLAS has 'glowing halo' and anti-tail suggesting 'it is alien spaceship'</h2>

<p>A Harvard professor has presented new evidence suggesting that comet 3I/ATLAS may not be a natural object, but rather an alien spaceship. Astrophysicist Avi Loeb has argued that the comet, which passed by Earth earlier this month, exhibits characteristics inconsistent with traditional comet behavior. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This matter has garnered significant attention as the scientific community largely agrees that 3I/ATLAS is a comet. However, Loeb's claims raise questions about its true nature. He believes further investigation into the object's 'anti-tail' could provide insights into its composition and origins.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: Comet 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Passage by Earth: Earlier this month</li>
    <li>Key figure: Avi Loeb, astrophysicist at Harvard University</li>
    <li>Claims: May be an alien spaceship</li>
    <li>Testing method: Molecular tracer to analyze the anti-tail</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Earlier this month, comet 3I/ATLAS passed by Earth. Following this event, Professor Avi Loeb presented his findings, arguing that the comet's characteristics suggest it could be an alien probe. He has proposed a method to test the nature of the anti-tail, which he believes should not contain gas beyond a certain distance if it is indeed a natural comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "This result presents a clean test for the nature of 3I/ATLAS: if it is a natural comet, then the anti-tail jet should not include streaming gas beyond a distance of 5,000 kilometers from the nucleus."</blockquote>

<blockquote>Loeb also mentioned, "The existence of streaming gas along the anti-tail can be tested through tagging a molecular tracer like CO2 or CO along the axis of the anti-tail jet."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been a subject of interest since its discovery due to its unusual characteristics. Previous discussions around unidentified aerial phenomena have sparked debates about the existence of extraterrestrial life, making this comet's behavior particularly noteworthy within the scientific community.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Loeb hopes that ground-based telescopes and space observatories will collect data to clarify the nature of the anti-tail of 3I/ATLAS. Further research is expected to continue as scientists investigate the object and its characteristics.</p>
