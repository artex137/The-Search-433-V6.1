      <h2>UFO Researcher Shares Insights on Antigravity Technology</h2>

<p>UFO researcher David Sereda has presented findings from his recent project involving the late Boyd Bushman, a former Lockheed Martin senior research scientist, during a broadcast on Coast to Coast. The discussion, which took place recently, highlighted Bushman's claims about antigravity technology and UFOs, but no injuries or fatalities were reported.</p>

<p>This disclosure is significant as it sheds light on alleged government research into UFO technology and antigravity propulsion. Authorities and researchers continue to explore these claims, and public interest remains high regarding the implications of such technologies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>73-year-old Boyd Bushman (1936-2014) was a senior research scientist at Lockheed Martin.</li>
    <li>Bushman claimed to have worked on reverse-engineering antigravity and UFO technology.</li>
    <li>He stated that Area 51 was used for testing alien craft before operations moved to Utah.</li>
    <li>Bushman discussed a nuclear-powered flying saucer first flown in 1959 at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.</li>
    <li>Remote viewing instructor Ed Dames warned about the spread of a wheat blight, a plant pathogen.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Boyd Bushman, known for his work at Lockheed Martin, made various claims regarding UFO technology and antigravity propulsion throughout his career. In recent interviews, he discussed specific experiments he conducted, including using magnets to manipulate gravity. Bushman also noted that Area 51 was a testing ground for alien technology before operations were relocated to a facility in Utah due to increased public scrutiny.</p>

<p>In a separate segment, Ed Dames addressed the ongoing spread of a wheat blight that he first mentioned in 1997, emphasizing its potential impact on the United States.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The age of the fungi is upon us,” Dames warned, urging for the construction of biodomes to ensure our survival.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Bushman's claims about Area 51 and the reverse-engineering of UFO technology align with long-standing public interest in government secrecy surrounding UFOs. The relocation of testing sites from Area 51 to Utah reflects ongoing concerns about transparency in military operations related to unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>

<p>Ed Dames’ warning about the wheat blight adds another layer of urgency to agricultural and environmental concerns, highlighting the intersection of science and public health.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the claims made by Bushman and the implications of antigravity technology are ongoing. It remains to be seen how authorities will respond to Dames’ warnings about the wheat blight and any potential measures that may be implemented to address these agricultural threats.</p>
