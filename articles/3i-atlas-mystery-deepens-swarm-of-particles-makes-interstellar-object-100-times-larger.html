      <h2>3I/ATLAS Mystery Deepens: Swarm of Particles Makes Interstellar Object 100 Times Larger</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is exhibiting unusual behaviour, raising questions among scientists about its nature and composition. Observations from the Hubble Space Telescope and ground-based facilities have revealed an unprecedented sunward-facing structure, known as an anti-tail, which contradicts established cometary physics. This phenomenon has sparked debate among astrophysicists, with some suggesting it may indicate alien technology.</p>

<p>The significance of these findings lies in their potential to redefine our understanding of comets. The unusual characteristics of 3I/ATLAS challenge current scientific models and may require new theories to explain its behaviour. Researchers continue to monitor the comet’s shape, speed, and brightness as it approaches the sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar visitor after 'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov.</li>
    <li>The comet has a maximum diameter estimated at 46 kilometres.</li>
    <li>It has lost approximately two million tons of material between July and October 2025.</li>
    <li>The gas plume is primarily composed of 87% carbon dioxide and only 4% water.</li>
    <li>The observed plume extends nearly one million kilometres towards the sun.</li>
    <li>Some researchers suggest the presence of nickel-iron alloys, which are common in industrial manufacturing.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, high-resolution imaging from the Hubble Space Telescope captured the first images of the anti-tail associated with 3I/ATLAS. This structure was noted for its unusual elongation, with a corrected aspect ratio of approximately 10:1.</p>
<p>Throughout August 2025, scientists began developing various theories to explain the anomaly, including the possibility of large dust particles or ice fragments. By September 2025, observations indicated that the comet was transitioning from the anti-tail to a more traditional tail structure.</p>
<p>In October 2025, further measurements confirmed the comet's significant mass loss while maintaining its structural integrity, prompting ongoing investigations into its unusual properties.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The sheer persistence and direction of this plume have led to increasingly desperate natural explanations,” said Avi Loeb from Harvard University, highlighting the debate surrounding the comet's behaviour.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “If the anti-tail was a 'braking thrust' from a massive alien spacecraft, the change in the plume's direction near perihelion would be entirely expected,” noted Adam Hibberd, also from Harvard, suggesting the possibility of extraterrestrial engineering.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS follows the interstellar objects 'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, both of which have also challenged existing models of celestial bodies. The ongoing investigation into 3I/ATLAS reflects a growing interest in the physical characteristics of interstellar visitors and the implications for our understanding of the universe.</p>
<p>The peculiar chemical composition of 3I/ATLAS, especially its high nickel content, further complicates the narrative, as it diverges from the typical profiles of known comets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it travels through the solar system, seeking to clarify its characteristics and behaviour before it fades from view. Ongoing studies may lead to new insights into its origins and the fundamental principles of cometary physics.</p>
