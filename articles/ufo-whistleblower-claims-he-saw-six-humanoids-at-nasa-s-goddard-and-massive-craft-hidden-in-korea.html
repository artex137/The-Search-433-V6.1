      <h2>UFO Whistleblower Claims He Saw Six 'Humanoids' at NASA's Goddard and Massive Craft Hidden in Korea</h2>

<p>A former whistleblower has claimed he saw six small humanoid bodies at NASA's Goddard Space Centre and a massive extraterrestrial craft hidden in Korea. The allegations surfaced decades after the purported experience, raising new questions about government secrecy and the existence of alien life.</p>

<p>The whistleblower's revelations have intensified discussions on UFOs and government transparency, especially following recent official confirmations of unexplained aerial phenomena. Authorities have not disclosed any ongoing investigations related to these claims.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Witness claims to have seen six humanoid bodies at NASA's Goddard Space Centre.</li>
    <li>Encounter reportedly occurred roughly fifty years ago.</li>
    <li>The bodies were stored in thick, frost-covered glass coffins, three floors underground.</li>
    <li>The whistleblower was escorted by Wernher von Braun.</li>
    <li>Claims of a massive craft hidden in South Korea, not North Korea.</li>
    <li>No independent verification of the claims has been provided.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>According to the whistleblower, he was escorted to a secure facility at NASA's Goddard Space Centre roughly fifty years ago. He described an icy room where six humanoid bodies were stored. He stated the experience has remained vivid in his memory.</p>

<p>The whistleblower clarified that while Area 51 is known for developing reverse-engineered technology from UFO wreckage, it is not a storage site for alien remains. He emphasized the public's lack of awareness regarding classified facilities.</p>

<p>In his latest claims, he mentioned a gigantic craft hidden in South Korea, stating that it is too large to be transported covertly and requires extensive logistical support to access.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“They were clearly not from this Earth. Small, pale, almost fragile, and badly injured,” the whistleblower claimed about the humanoid bodies.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Obama has confirmed aliens exist, but he also said he saw no evidence of them being stored at secret bases like Area 51,” he added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This claim comes amid a resurgence of interest in UFOs and government disclosures regarding unidentified aerial phenomena. The whistleblower's account contradicts popular beliefs about alien storage sites, particularly the well-known Area 51.</p>

<p>Previous incidents of alleged UFO sightings and government secrecy have prompted ongoing debates among enthusiasts and skeptics alike, with many questioning the extent of what is known or hidden from the public.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities have not announced any investigations related to the whistleblower's claims. The implications of these allegations continue to fuel discussions on extraterrestrial life and government transparency.</p>
