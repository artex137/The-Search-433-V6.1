      <h2>3I/ATLAS was not a threat to Earth, but what about the poisonous ‘cyanide’ it left behind?</h2>

<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS made its closest fly-by of Earth on December 19, 2023, without posing any threat, according to NASA. However, concerns have arisen regarding the potential toxic debris, particularly hydrogen cyanide, that may have been released as the comet approached the Sun.</p>

<p>This matter has gained attention following statements from Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb, who questioned whether any of the material shed by 3I/ATLAS could reach Earth. NASA has confirmed that the comet poses no danger, but the discovery of toxic particles has prompted further scientific inquiry.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS flew closest to Earth on December 19, 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet was approximately 170 million miles away at its closest point.</li>
    <li>Hydrogen cyanide was detected in the comet's gas plume, which appeared green near the Sun.</li>
    <li>NASA has stated that 3I/ATLAS does not pose a threat to Earth.</li>
    <li>Loeb speculated that tiny dust particles could be pushed away by solar radiation pressure.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2023. Observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Chile earlier in the fall revealed the presence of methanol and hydrogen cyanide. Following these findings, Avi Loeb raised concerns about the possible implications of the comet's gas plume.</p>

<p>Despite these concerns, NASA confirmed that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth, as the gas would be swept away by solar wind at a distance of several million kilometers from the comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, “Given the mass loss rate measured by the Webb Space Telescope, the gas around 3I/ATLAS would be swept up by the solar wind at a distance of just a few million kilometers from 3I/ATLAS.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>Loeb added, “Given the mass loss rate of 3I/ATLAS, there are less than a million of these large objects released in recent months.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous discussions around interstellar objects have often included theories about their origins and potential impacts on Earth. While some scientists, including Loeb, have speculated about artificial origins of such objects, the scientific consensus remains focused on observable data and known physical laws regarding their behavior.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further scientific investigations are expected to continue as researchers analyze the data collected from observations of 3I/ATLAS. No immediate risks have been identified, and the focus will likely remain on understanding the comet’s properties and implications for future interstellar objects.</p>
