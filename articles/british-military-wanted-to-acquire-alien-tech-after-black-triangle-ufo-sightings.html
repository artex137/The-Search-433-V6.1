      <h2>British military wanted to 'acquire alien tech' after black triangle UFO sightings</h2>

<p>Military intelligence in the UK has considered whether to "acquire" unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) technology, according to documents released from The National Archives in Kew, Richmond. These documents indicate that the Defence Intelligence Staff, the previous name of Defence Intelligence within the Ministry of Defence, took UAP sightings seriously during the 1990s.</p>

<p>This revelation highlights ongoing interest in UAPs and their potential implications for national security. Authorities are now reviewing the information, which suggests that the military viewed these phenomena as a credible concern that could threaten national defence.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Documents dated March 4, 1997, indicate military interest in UAP technology.</li>
<li>The Defence Intelligence Staff investigated reports of strange objects in the sky.</li>
<li>The black triangle UAP sightings occurred in Belgium from 1989 to 1990.</li>
<li>The Belgian Ministry of Defence confirmed sightings of delta-shaped craft.</li>
<li>The Rendlesham Forest incident took place in December 1980, involving US Air Force personnel.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In the late 1980s and early 1990s, multiple reports emerged in Belgium regarding sightings of black triangle UAPs. These sightings prompted the Defence Intelligence Staff to investigate the phenomena seriously.</p>
<p>On March 4, 1997, a memo suggested that the military should consider acquiring technology from these UAPs, which were noted for their unusual propulsion methods and high-speed capabilities.</p>
<p>In December 1980, the Rendlesham Forest incident occurred, where US Air Force personnel at RAF Bentwaters and RAF Woodbridge reported seeing unusual lights and a UFO.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>"Logic would indicate that if significant numbers are reporting seeing strange objects in the sky then there may be a basis in fact," the memo stated. "It could be argued that UAPs pose a potential threat to the defence of the realm since we have no idea what they are!"</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The report noted, "A supplementary issue is the possibility of technology acquisition. UAPs do not appear to use conventional reaction propulsion."</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The documents reflect a long-standing interest in UAPs within the military, with notable incidents such as the Rendlesham Forest event and the Belgian sightings contributing to the discourse. The mention of a French interest and an American intelligence grouping indicates that these phenomena have garnered international attention.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities are expected to continue reviewing these documents and may pursue further investigations into UAPs and their implications for national security.</p>
