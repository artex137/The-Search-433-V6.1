      <h2>Donald Trump Briefed on Alien Presence, Claims UFO Whistleblower</h2>

<p>A UFO whistleblower has claimed that former US President Donald Trump was briefed on recovered non-human craft and potential alien biologics. David Grusch, a retired US intelligence officer and former US Air Force Major, made the assertions during a recent interview, stating that Trump has been informed about the existence of alien life and retrievals by the US Government.</p>

<p>This claim has sparked global debate about government transparency regarding unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP). Grusch, who currently advises Congress's UAP Task Force, alleges that the US Government has concealed information about UFOs for decades. He believes that Trump's future disclosures could be significant, stating that he will soon become the "most consequential leader in world history" by revealing these details.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>David Grusch is a retired US intelligence officer and former US Air Force Major.</li>
    <li>Grusch served on the UAP Task Force from 2019 to 2021.</li>
    <li>He has claimed knowledge of a multi-decade UAP crash retrieval and reverse-engineering program.</li>
    <li>Grusch alleges the US government possesses "non-human" spacecraft and "non-human biologics."</li>
    <li>Trump stated on the Lex Fridman Podcast in September 2024 that he would declassify files related to aliens.</li>
    <li>No corroborating evidence has been provided by the White House, US Army, or NASA.</li>
    <li>Missouri Congressman Eric Burlison has mentioned the existence of at least four alien hybrid species.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>From 2019 to 2021, David Grusch served as a representative of the National Reconnaissance Office on the UAP Task Force. He later became a whistleblower after learning about the lack of congressional oversight concerning extraterrestrial matters. In July 2023, Grusch provided testimony under oath to Congress regarding the US government's alleged UAP programs. In September 2024, Trump expressed his intention to declassify information about aliens during an interview on the Lex Fridman Podcast.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Members of this current administration are very well aware of this reality. Certainly, the current president is very knowledgeable on this subject,” said Grusch in a recent interview.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “Sure, I’ll do that. I would do that. I’d love to do that. I have to do that,” Trump stated regarding the declassification of alien-related files.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Grusch's claims add to a growing discourse surrounding UFOs and government transparency, particularly following recent congressional hearings on UAPs. The topic has gained traction as various officials and former military personnel have reported encounters with unidentified aerial phenomena. However, the lack of physical evidence and official acknowledgment continues to fuel skepticism.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the claims made by Grusch and others are ongoing, with potential implications for government policy and public disclosure regarding extraterrestrial life. Further testimonies and hearings may be scheduled as Congress continues to explore these issues.</p>
