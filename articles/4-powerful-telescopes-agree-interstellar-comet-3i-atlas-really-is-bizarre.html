      <h2>4 Powerful Telescopes Agree: Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Really Is Bizarre</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has exhibited unusual characteristics during its journey through the Solar System, according to observations made by NASA and European Space Agency (ESA) instruments, including Hubble, SPHEREx, JWST, and TESS. The comet was first detected on July 1, 2025, and is expected to reach its closest approach to the Sun on October 29, 2025.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant because it may provide insights into the comet's formation, the environment through which it has traveled, and its internal composition. Scientists are focusing their observations on 3I/ATLAS as it approaches perihelion, but its position will soon obscure it from view due to the Sun's brightness.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun (perihelion) is scheduled for October 29, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet was already active at a distance of about 6 astronomical units (AU) from the Sun.</li>
    <li>Measurements indicate a coma with a carbon dioxide to water ratio of 8 to 1.</li>
    <li>The coma has been observed to extend out to a radius of 23 kilometers.</li>
    <li>The comet's radius is approximately 2.8 kilometers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first observed on July 1, 2025. However, data from TESS suggests that the comet was already active as early as May 2025, approximately two months prior to its official discovery. The comet has been actively outgassing carbon dioxide and water since that time.</p>

<p>In mid-August 2025, SPHEREx captured multi-spectral observations of the comet at distances between 3.3 and 3.1 AU from the Sun. It noted a coma rich in carbon dioxide. Observations from JWST around the same time also confirmed the high carbon dioxide content.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Our observations are compatible with an intrinsically CO2-rich nucleus, which may indicate that 3I/ATLAS contains ices exposed to higher levels of radiation than Solar System comets, or that it formed close to the CO2 ice line in its parent protoplanetary disk,” researchers stated in their preprint paper.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object to pass through the Solar System. Its unusual composition raises questions about the conditions in its native environment and how it compares to other comets observed in our Solar System.</p>

<p>Previous interstellar objects have provided valuable data about the formation of celestial bodies outside our Solar System, and 3I/ATLAS is expected to contribute further to this understanding.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches perihelion, scientists will continue to monitor its activity. After perihelion, the comet will make its closest approach to Earth and may be observed by Mars orbiters as it travels out of the Solar System. Future observations could provide additional insights into the comet's unique characteristics.</p>
