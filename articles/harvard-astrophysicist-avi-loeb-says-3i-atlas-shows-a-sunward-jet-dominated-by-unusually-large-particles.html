      <h2>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb says 3I/ATLAS shows a sunward jet dominated by unusually large particles</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist <strong>Avi Loeb</strong> has published an essay on December 25, 2025, analyzing the interstellar comet <strong>3I/ATLAS</strong> and its unusual features, particularly its anti-tail. In his essay, published on Medium, Loeb discusses the comet's long, tightly collimated jet, which is directed toward the sun and contains unusually large particles.</p>

<p>This analysis is significant because it challenges existing theories about comet behavior. Loeb's findings may prompt further investigation by the scientific community to understand the physical characteristics of 3I/ATLAS, which do not align with typical comet physics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date of publication:</strong> December 25, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Comet:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Length of anti-tail:</strong> up to 400,000 kilometers</li>
    <li><strong>Particle size range:</strong> larger than 1 micron and smaller than 100 microns</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Avi Loeb has conducted ongoing research into the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, focusing on its anti-tail and jet structure. His latest findings, published on December 25, 2025, highlight the comet's unusual particle composition and jet behavior.</p>

<p>Loeb has observed that the anti-tail of 3I/ATLAS is not only longer than typical comets but also exhibits a focused stream of material directed toward the sun. This observation has led him to conclude that the particles in the jet are likely larger than those found in conventional comets.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The physical features of 3I/ATLAS are strange and worth looking into,” said Loeb, emphasizing the need for skepticism and further study of the comet.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Standard physics fails to explain the physical features of the visitor,” Loeb concluded in his essay.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The behavior of comets has been studied extensively, with typical anti-tails being shorter and less focused than that of 3I/ATLAS. Loeb's observations challenge the established understanding of comet physics and suggest that further investigation is necessary to explain the anomalies observed in this interstellar object.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Loeb hopes that his findings will encourage other scientists to remain skeptical and continue to explore the unique characteristics of 3I/ATLAS as research into the comet progresses.</p>
