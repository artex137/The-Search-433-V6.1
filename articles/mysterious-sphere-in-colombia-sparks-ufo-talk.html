      <h2>Mysterious sphere in Colombia sparks UFO talk</h2>

<p>Scientists in Mexico are studying a metal orb believed to have extraterrestrial origins after it was recovered in Colombia earlier this year. The sphere, marked with decorative etchings, crashed near Buga, Colombia, in March, attracting significant online interest regarding its potential as an unidentified flying object (UFO).</p>

<p>The investigation into the orb has drawn attention from UFO enthusiasts and researchers alike. Authorities have not disclosed further details about the ongoing studies or any official investigations related to the incident.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Incident occurred in March 2023.</li>
    <li>The orb was recovered near Buga, Colombia.</li>
    <li>A video featuring researcher Jose Luis Velazquez has garnered over 500,000 views.</li>
    <li>Velazquez reported that the sphere has three layers of different densities.</li>
    <li>The Pentagon released a report last year stating no confirmed sightings of UFOs with alien origins.</li>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In March 2023, a metal orb crashed in Buga, Colombia. The sphere was filmed floating erratically before its descent, capturing the attention of UFO enthusiasts. Researcher Jose Luis Velazquez later shared a video discussing the orb's unique features, including its multilayered structure.</p>
<p>Following the orb's recovery, scientists in Mexico have taken an interest in studying it, but further details about the investigations have not been disclosed.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It looks to me like a really cool art project,” said Julia Mossbridge, founder of the Mossbridge Institute and an affiliate professor in the physics department at the University of San Diego, regarding the orb's potential origins.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Pentagon has previously released a report indicating there have been no confirmed sightings of UFOs with alien origins. This report was part of a broader investigation into unidentified anomalous phenomena, which included both classified and unclassified documents. The Defense Department has since established an All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office to address new reports.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the orb's origins and properties are ongoing, with scientists in Mexico actively studying the object. Further updates from authorities have not been disclosed.</p>
