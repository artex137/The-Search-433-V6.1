      <h2>3I/ATLAS: Interstellar Visitor Traveling at Impressive Speed Observed from Mars</h2>

<p>On October 3rd, the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS was captured by the European Space Agency's ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter during its close approach to Mars, approximately 30 million kilometers from the planet. The object was traveling at a speed of 210,000 km/h. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as it marks the closest view the European Space Agency (ESA) will obtain of this cosmic visitor. The Mars Express orbiter could not detect the comet due to its faintness, but the Trace Gas Orbiter successfully used its instruments, originally designed for closer Martian observations, to capture images of 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of observation: October 3rd</li>
    <li>Distance from Mars: 30 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Speed: 210,000 km/h</li>
    <li>Estimated diameter of 3I/ATLAS: between 5 and 11 kilometers</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun: October 30th</li>
    <li>Next visibility from Earth: December 2023</li>
    <li>Projected departure from the Solar System: March 2026</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS approached Mars on October 3rd, where it was observed by the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter. The orbiter used innovative techniques to capture images of the comet, which appeared significantly fainter than typical targets. The comet is expected to reach its closest point to the Sun on October 30th, potentially increasing its activity.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a raw image from NASA's Perseverance rover has shown a bright streak in the Martian sky that might correspond to the comet, although analyses are ongoing to confirm this. The Mars Express orbiter, positioned for observations, could not detect 3I/ATLAS due to its faint brightness.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>‚ÄúThe comet appeared approximately 10,000 to 100,000 times fainter than the instrument‚Äôs usual targets, representing a true technical achievement,‚Äù researchers stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object, following 'Oumuamua and Borisov, and is believed to be the largest identified so far. Interstellar objects originate from other planetary systems and are not gravitationally bound to the Sun. Their study offers insights into the composition and formation of distant stellar systems.</p>

<p>Detecting such objects poses challenges due to their small size, faintness, and rapid movement. Advances in observation techniques have improved the ability to identify these fleeting cosmic visitors.</p>

<h2>What‚Äôs next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to analyze images and data from various spacecraft to determine if more observations of 3I/ATLAS were made during its passage. The comet will become visible again from Earth in December before it exits the Solar System in March 2026.</p>
