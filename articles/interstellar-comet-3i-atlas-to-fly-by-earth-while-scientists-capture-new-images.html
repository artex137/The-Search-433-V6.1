      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS to Fly By Earth While Scientists Capture New Images</h2>

<p>An interstellar comet named 3I/ATLAS is on its way out of the solar system and is scheduled to pass near Earth on Friday, approximately 167 million miles (270 million kilometers) away. The comet, first identified in July, will be positioned on the opposite side of the sun during its closest approach.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it provides a rare opportunity for scientists to capture new images of the comet and learn more about its composition and origins. The Virtual Telescope Project will livestream the event at 4:00 a.m. UTC on Saturday, or 11 p.m. ET Friday, following a previous unsuccessful attempt due to weather conditions. NASA has stated that 3I/ATLAS will remain observable for telescopes and space missions for a few more months before it exits the solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS will pass Earth at a distance of approximately 167 million miles (270 million kilometers).</li>
    <li>The closest approach is scheduled for Friday, with the comet positioned on the opposite side of the sun.</li>
    <li>The Virtual Telescope Project will livestream the comet at 4:00 a.m. UTC on Saturday, or 11 p.m. ET Friday.</li>
    <li>NASA indicates that the comet will remain observable for a few more months.</li>
    <li>X-ray emissions from the comet have been detected, a first for interstellar comets.</li>
    <li>Japan's XRISM monitored 3I/ATLAS for 17 hours, detecting X-rays extending about 248,000 miles (400,000 kilometers) from the nucleus.</li>
    <li>The European Space Agency’s XMM-Newton observed the comet for about 20 hours on December 3.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified in July 2023. Since then, astronomers have closely monitored the comet, gathering data across various wavelengths. Notably, in late November, Japan's XRISM conducted a 17-hour observation using its Xtend telescope, which detected X-ray emissions from the comet. The European Space Agency’s XMM-Newton followed with its own observations on December 3.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The X-ray observations, together with other data across various wavelengths of light, could potentially unveil the composition of 3I/ATLAS,” NASA stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior encounters with interstellar comets, specifically in 2017 and 2019, did not reveal X-ray emissions. However, 3I/ATLAS has shown that such emissions are possible, suggesting new avenues for understanding these celestial objects. Observations of comets formed within our solar system typically show X-ray emissions, and this discovery may bridge the knowledge gap between interstellar and solar system comets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to observe 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the sun and exits the solar system. The data collected from various observations will help clarify the comet's composition and its behavior compared to other known comets.</p>
