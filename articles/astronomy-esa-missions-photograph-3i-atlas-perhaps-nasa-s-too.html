      <h2>Astronomy: ESA missions photograph 3I/ATLAS, perhaps NASA's too</h2>

<p>The European Space Agency (ESA) has announced that its Trace Gas Orbiter has successfully captured images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS from Mars' orbit. These images were taken after the comet became too faint to be seen from Earth. NASA has not yet confirmed if its rover Perseverance has also photographed the comet.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it highlights the capabilities of space exploration instruments, especially during unexpected events. ESA reports that while the Trace Gas Orbiter can image the comet, further analyses are required to determine the insights these images may provide.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2023 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Chile.</li>
    <li>ESA's Trace Gas Orbiter photographed the comet from Mars' orbit using the Color and Stereo Surface Imaging System (CaSSIS).</li>
    <li>The comet is currently behind the sun from Earth's perspective.</li>
    <li>NASA's activities have been minimal since October 1 due to the U.S. government shutdown.</li>
    <li>Images from the Perseverance rover that may show 3I/ATLAS are being automatically published online.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in early July 2023 by ATLAS in Chile. Since then, it has been monitored as it approached the sun, losing material and revealing its composition. ESA's Trace Gas Orbiter captured images of the comet while in orbit around Mars, but Mars Express has not yet succeeded in photographing it. NASA's Perseverance rover may have also photographed the comet, but no official confirmation has been provided.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The images taken by the Trace Gas Orbiter emphasize the performance of the research instruments in the face of unplanned events,” ESA stated.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar visitor to the solar system discovered during transit. The comet's unique characteristics are important for understanding its composition as it approaches the sun. The ongoing government shutdown in the U.S. has limited NASA's operational capabilities, affecting its ability to engage with such discoveries.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>In the coming weeks, additional instruments will be directed towards 3I/ATLAS, and it is expected to become visible from Earth again. Further analyses of the images taken by ESA and possible findings from NASA's Perseverance rover will be conducted to enhance understanding of the comet.</p>
