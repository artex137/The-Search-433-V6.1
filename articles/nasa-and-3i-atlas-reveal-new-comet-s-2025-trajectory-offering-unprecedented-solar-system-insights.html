      <h2>Nasa and 3I Atlas reveal new comet’s 2025 trajectory, offering unprecedented solar system insights</h2>

<p>A newly identified celestial body, designated Comet 3I Atlas, has attracted global attention following its detection by the ATLAS (Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System) survey in early 2025. The discovery marks a significant moment for planetary science, promising new data on the solar system’s ancient history. Nasa has initiated a comprehensive observation campaign to monitor the comet's approach, which is expected to bring it relatively close to Earth in mid-2025.</p>

<p>This discovery matters because it provides a rare opportunity to study a potentially pristine object from the Oort Cloud or beyond. The comet's unique trajectory suggests it may originate from regions largely untouched by solar radiation and other environmental factors. Nasa's inter-agency Comet Observation Program has deployed resources to ensure continuous monitoring, while international observatories collaborate to gather extensive data.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I Atlas</li>
    <li><strong>Detection Date:</strong> Early 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Observation Campaign:</strong> Nasa's Comet Observation Program activated</li>
    <li><strong>Expected Closest Approach:</strong> Mid-2025</li>
    <li><strong>Key Observatories Involved:</strong> International observatories in Chile, Hawaii, and South Africa</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In late January 2025, astronomers first flagged Comet 3I Atlas, noting its elongated orbit and spectral signature. Follow-up observations confirmed its cometary nature, leading to its designation as 3I Atlas.</p>
<p>Following this confirmation, Nasa activated its Comet Observation Program to ensure continuous monitoring. The ATLAS survey, featuring enhanced sensitivity and wider field-of-view capabilities, was instrumental in the comet's detection.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Nasa has mobilized ground-based telescopes and coordinated with international partners to monitor the comet’s approach, aiming to gather as much data as possible before it reaches its closest point to Earth.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The detection of Comet 3I Atlas represents a significant advancement in the capabilities of the ATLAS survey. Its unique trajectory and composition provide an opportunity to study materials from the solar system’s formative stages, enhancing understanding of planet formation and the delivery of water and organic molecules to early Earth.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Over the next few months, Nasa and its partners will focus on several objectives, including characterizing the comet’s nucleus, analyzing its chemical composition, and studying its outgassing processes as it nears its perihelion. The extensive data gathered during this observation period will inform future mission concepts for deeper studies of similar objects.</p>
