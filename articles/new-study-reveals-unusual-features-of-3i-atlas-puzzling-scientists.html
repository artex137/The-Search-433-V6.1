      <h2>New study reveals unusual features of 3I/ATLAS, puzzling scientists</h2>

<p>A new study has identified a series of unusual characteristics of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, prompting experts to question its origin. The findings, reported by News.Az, have raised significant discussions in the astrophysics community as scientists analyze its trajectory and physical behavior.</p>

<p>This study matters because it challenges conventional understanding of comets and interstellar objects. Authorities, including astronomers from Harvard and other research institutions, are now closely examining the data to determine whether 3I/ATLAS is a typical comet or something entirely different.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is expected to make its closest approach to Jupiter on 16 March 2026, at an estimated distance of 53.445 million kilometres.</li>
    <li>The object will come within 30 million kilometres of Mars on 3 October 2025.</li>
    <li>The core mass of 3I/ATLAS is about a million times greater than the interstellar object 1I/'Oumuamua.</li>
    <li>The composition of its gas cloud shows a higher nickel-to-iron ratio than typical comets.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is moving faster than both 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has exhibited unique behaviors since its arrival in the inner solar system. Observations from July, August, and November 2025 noted the object displaying a jet pointing towards the Sun, verified through HiRISE images captured near Mars.</p>
<p>The object is set to approach Mars on 3 October 2025, while its closest approach to the Sun occurred at an unobservable distance from Earth.</p>
<p>On 16 March 2026, 3I/ATLAS will pass Jupiter, with its trajectory closely aligning with the planet's Hill radius, raising further questions about its non-gravitational acceleration.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb, a Harvard professor, stated, “These anomalies challenge our understanding of cosmic visitors.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Jason Wright, an astronomer, noted in his blog, “3I/ATLAS is moving at a greater speed than previously observed interstellar objects.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This study builds on previous observations of interstellar objects, such as 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, which have already expanded our understanding of cosmic phenomena. The irregularities observed in 3I/ATLAS suggest it may possess traits not commonly seen in other known comets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Ongoing monitoring of 3I/ATLAS is essential to refine these measurements and further classify its unique characteristics. Researchers are expected to continue analyzing data as the object approaches Mars and Jupiter in the coming years.</p>
