      <h2>This Australian Ceremony Showed a “Sky Being” Older Than Any UFO Report</h2>

<p>A ceremony in Australia has showcased a “Sky Being” that participants claim predates any known UFO report. The event took place in an undisclosed location, but it has drawn attention for its connection to Indigenous culture and beliefs regarding celestial beings.</p>

<p>This ceremony highlights the intersection of traditional beliefs and contemporary discussions about unidentified flying objects (UFOs). Organizers aim to promote awareness and understanding of Indigenous perspectives on the cosmos, which they assert have existed for millennia, long before the modern UFO phenomenon gained traction in the 20th century.</p>
