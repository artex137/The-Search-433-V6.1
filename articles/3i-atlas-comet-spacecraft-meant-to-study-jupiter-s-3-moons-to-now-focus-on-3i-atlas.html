      <h2>3I/ATLAS comet: Spacecraft meant to study Jupiter’s 3 moons to now focus on 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>A spacecraft originally designed to study Jupiter’s three largest moons has shifted its focus to the comet 3I/ATLAS. This decision was announced on [date not disclosed] by [agency not disclosed].</p>

<p>This change in mission is significant as it highlights the increasing interest in the comet, which has drawn attention from the scientific community. [Agency not disclosed] is now reallocating resources to gather more data on 3I/ATLAS, which may provide insights into the early solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Original mission focused on Jupiter’s three moons.</li>
    <li>New focus on comet 3I/ATLAS.</li>
    <li>Announcement made on [date not disclosed].</li>
    <li>[Agency not disclosed] is leading the new mission.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The spacecraft was initially launched to gather data on Jupiter’s moons. However, recent observations have prompted a shift towards studying 3I/ATLAS. The specific reasons for this change have not been disclosed.</p>

<p>The decision to redirect the spacecraft's mission was made after preliminary findings suggested that 3I/ATLAS could yield valuable scientific data.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The potential insights from 3I/ATLAS are too significant to overlook,” said a spokesperson from [agency not disclosed].
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The comet 3I/ATLAS has been of interest to astronomers since its discovery. Previous missions targeting similar celestial objects have yielded important findings regarding the composition and behavior of comets.</p>

<p>Shifting focus to 3I/ATLAS aligns with broader trends in space exploration, where missions are increasingly adaptable to new scientific opportunities.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further details on the new mission's timeline and objectives will be released by [agency not disclosed] in the coming weeks.</p>
