      <h2>Does Tucker Carlson Know More About UFO Disclosure Than He’s Saying?</h2>

<p>Christian researcher and filmmaker L.A. Marzulli has stated that the increasing wave of government and media revelations about UFOs, or UAPs, is significant. He believes these developments are indicative of a prophetic setup for global deception. Marzulli made these comments in a recent video, emphasizing the importance of public awareness regarding ongoing disclosures.</p>

<p>Marzulli argues that the mainstream conversation around UFOs began with Tucker Carlson's 2017 interview with former Navy pilot Commander David Fravor. During this interview, Fravor described a “tic-tac-shaped object” moving at extraordinary speeds. Despite Carlson's public dismissal of UFO topics, Marzulli noted that airing the interview marked a key moment in the discourse surrounding UFOs.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Interview aired in 2017 featuring Commander David Fravor.</li>
    <li>Fravor described an object moving 50 miles in two seconds.</li>
    <li>Marzulli claims the current discourse has reached “rung number 23” of disclosure.</li>
    <li>Former intelligence officer David Grusch testified before Congress regarding UFOs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2017, Tucker Carlson interviewed Commander David Fravor, who reported seeing a tic-tac-shaped object. This interview is considered a pivotal moment in the public discourse on UFOs. Since then, Marzulli has tracked the progression of disclosures, stating that discussions have advanced significantly, culminating in testimony from David Grusch before Congress.</p>

<p>Marzulli has characterized these revelations as steps on a "ladder of disclosure," with each rung representing increasing acknowledgment of UFOs and related phenomena by authorities.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“UFOs are real, burgeoning and not going away,” Marzulli said. “Disclosure is happening, folks, and people need to be aware of it.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“When Tucker asked, ‘In your opinion, what was this object?’ Fravor looked right at the camera and said ‘Whatever this was was not from this Earth.’ I about fell out of my chair,” Marzulli said.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“At some point, there’s going to be a nuclear event, and it creates the greatest climate of fear humanity has ever experienced collectively. That’s when they show up,” Marzulli said.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Marzulli argues that the current UFO disclosures relate to a broader narrative involving a potential spiritual deception, which he attributes to a worldview rooted in Darwinism. He contrasts this perspective with biblical teachings regarding creation, suggesting that the conversation around UFOs may lead to significant societal changes.</p>

<p>He warns Christians to remain vigilant as discussions about UFOs intensify, positing that these events have been planned for centuries.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Marzulli has indicated that his ministry will continue to monitor developments in UFO disclosures. He asserts that awareness and understanding of these events are crucial as the conversation evolves.</p>
