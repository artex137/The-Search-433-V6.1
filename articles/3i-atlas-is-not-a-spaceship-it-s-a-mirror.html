      <h2>3I/ATLAS Is a Comet, Not a Spaceship</h2>

<p>The European Space Agency (ESA) has confirmed that 3I/ATLAS, a comet observed near Mars, is not a spacecraft but rather an ancient icy body passing through the Solar System. The comet, only the third interstellar comet ever observed, was imaged by ESA's ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter and Mars Express between October 1 and 7, 2025.</p>

<p>This observation matters as it highlights public fascination with the unknown and reflects broader societal anxieties. ESA scientists have worked to debunk theories suggesting the comet is a spacecraft, emphasizing that the evidence supports its classification as a natural celestial object.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was imaged between October 1 and 7, 2025.</li>
    <li>It is approximately 30 million kilometers away from Earth.</li>
    <li>ESA's ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter and Mars Express captured the comet’s images.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar comet officially recognized.</li>
    <li>Data has shown no signs of artificial structures or signals.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Between October 1 and 7, 2025, ESA's ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter and Mars Express focused their cameras on 3I/ATLAS. On October 3, the TGO's CaSSIS camera captured images of the comet, revealing its icy nucleus and a glowing halo of gas and dust. Scientists are currently analyzing the data collected to confirm their findings.</p>

<p>ESA has also utilized instruments like OMEGA and NOMAD to detect volatile ices in the comet, further supporting its natural origin. Observations indicate that the comet follows a hyperbolic trajectory, confirming it is a transient visitor to the Solar System.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “This was a very challenging observation — about 10,000 to 100,000 times fainter than our usual targets,” said Nick Thomas, CaSSIS’s principal investigator. “Difficult doesn’t mean mysterious. It just means dim.”
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The comet's appearance has sparked a wave of speculation and imaginative theories on social media, often attributing it to alien technology. ESA’s findings, however, have consistently pointed to the comet being a natural object, revealing the public's yearning for narratives of control in uncertain times.</p>

<p>The fascination with 3I/ATLAS reflects broader societal trends, including economic challenges and feelings of powerlessness that have led many to seek grand explanations for their circumstances.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>ESA scientists will continue to analyze data from 3I/ATLAS as it nears the Sun, where it will brighten before disappearing from view. The ongoing study aims to deepen understanding of interstellar objects and their origins, focusing on their physical characteristics rather than speculative narratives.</p>
