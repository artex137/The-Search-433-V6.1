      <h2>Astronomers Plan Mysterious 'Training Exercise' on Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Astronomers have scheduled a special training exercise focused on Comet 3I/ATLAS, which will make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025. The exercise will run from November 27, 2025, to January 27, 2026, coinciding with the comet's proximity to our planet. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in relation to the comet.</p>

<p>This exercise is significant as it aims to refine methods for tracking the comet, which has exhibited unusual behavior. The International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) has added 3I/ATLAS to its list of potentially dangerous near-Earth objects, highlighting its unique challenges in trajectory prediction. Authorities are taking steps to improve detection skills for such space rocks to prepare for any potential threats.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS will approach Earth on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>The training exercise will occur from November 27, 2025, to January 27, 2026.</li>
    <li>The comet has a mass greater than <strong>33 billion tons</strong> and a minimum diameter of <strong>5 kilometers</strong>.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the first interstellar object added to the IAWN list.</li>
    <li>Ground-based observations will be impossible through October 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July and August 2025, Hubble Space Telescope images captured an unusual "anti-tail" on Comet 3I/ATLAS. By September 2025, new observations showed a tail reversal, now pointing away from the Sun. The comet's behavior has raised questions among astronomers, prompting the training exercise to improve tracking methods.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“They’re calling it a test of improved astrometry methods. In other words, the object isn’t behaving like it should,” said an anonymous source.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previously, 3I/ATLAS had been noted for its unusual characteristics, including its interstellar origin and significant size. The comet's addition to the IAWN list indicates growing international concern over its unpredictable trajectory and potential impact risks.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>During the training exercise, astronomers will focus on refining tracking methods for Comet 3I/ATLAS. Observations will continue as the comet approaches the Sun and Earth, with results expected to inform future assessments of its trajectory.</p>
