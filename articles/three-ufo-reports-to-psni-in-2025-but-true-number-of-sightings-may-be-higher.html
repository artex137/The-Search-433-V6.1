      <h2>Three UFO reports to PSNI in 2025 but true number of sightings ‘may be higher’</h2>

<p>Three reports of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) have been submitted to the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) in 2025, including sightings of three orange lights in a triangle formation. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with these sightings.</p>

<p>The PSNI has stated that the three reports were noted for information purposes only. Authorities have indicated that there might be a higher number of UFO sightings that go unreported, as many people may hesitate to contact police. The Ministry of Defence previously closed its UFO desk in 2009 after finding no evidence of threats from UFOs. Nick Pope, a former investigator for the Ministry, has expressed concern about underreporting of sightings.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Three UFO reports received by PSNI in 2025</li>
    <li>First report from Abbey Park in Armagh: three orange lights in a triangle</li>
    <li>Second report from Cypress Park, east Belfast: UFO above airport/docks</li>
    <li>Third report from Norwood Court, Coleraine: emergency call mentioning "UFO"</li>
    <li>No current investigations or lines of inquiry identified by PSNI</li>
    <li>Previous sightings in Northern Ireland: 4 in 2019, 6 in 2020, 8 in 2021, 1 in 2022, 0 from January 1 to November 1, 2023</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2025, the PSNI received three reports concerning UFOs. The first report came from Abbey Park in Armagh, where witnesses described three orange lights in a perfect triangle. The second report was from an address recorded as Cypress Park, likely referring to Cyprus Park in east Belfast, which noted a UFO sighting above the airport and docks. The third report originated from Norwood Court in Coleraine, with an emergency call mentioning a "UFO."</p>

<p>Over the past several years, the number of reported UFO sightings in Northern Ireland has fluctuated. In 2024, there were three reports, including one from a Belfast resident who described a flying object with green and red flashing lights. The PSNI has not received any reports related to widely discussed lights in the sky across Ireland in October 2023, which were attributed to debris from a rocket launch in Florida.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“There was nothing ongoing and no lines of inquiry were identified at the time of the call,” police said in response to the UFO reports.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Nick Pope stated, “While these figures are very low, it doesn’t mean people in Northern Ireland aren’t seeing strange things in the skies.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>He added, “I suspect the low numbers reflect the fact that a lot of people who see UFOs don’t report them, perhaps because they don’t think they’d be taken seriously.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Ministry of Defence has a history of recording UFO sightings but ceased operations of its UFO desk in 2009. This decision was based on findings that no reports had ever disclosed any evidence of a potential threat. The fluctuation in reported sightings suggests varying public interest and willingness to report unusual occurrences in the sky.</p>

<p>Recent reports of strange lights in the sky across Ireland in October 2023, attributed to rocket debris, highlight the ongoing intrigue surrounding UFO sightings.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The PSNI has not disclosed any plans for further investigations into the recent UFO reports. Authorities continue to monitor public interest and may collaborate with other organizations as necessary.</p>
