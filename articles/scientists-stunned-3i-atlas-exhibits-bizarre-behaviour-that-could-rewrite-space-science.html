      <h2>Scientists Stunned: 3I/ATLAS Exhibits Bizarre Behaviour That Could Rewrite Space Science</h2>

<p>The third confirmed interstellar object to enter the Solar System, 3I/ATLAS, has exhibited unusual physical and orbital characteristics since its discovery on 1 July 2025. Observations have revealed behaviour inconsistent with any previously documented comet, prompting significant interest and debate in the scientific community.</p>

<p>This discovery is important as it may challenge existing models of comet classification and formation. Authorities, including NASA and international planetary defence networks, are closely monitoring 3I/ATLAS to refine their protocols for future interstellar visitors.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered: 1 July 2025</li>
    <li>Estimated nucleus mass: One million times that of 1I/ʻOumuamua</li>
    <li>Predicted closest approach to Jupiter (perijove): 53.445 million kilometres in 2026</li>
    <li>Observed light cycle: 16.16 hours</li>
    <li>Confirmed sunward jets observed between July and November 2025</li>
    <li>Imaging conducted by: Hubble Space Telescope and HiRISE camera</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected on 1 July 2025. Since then, scientists have gathered data that shows its hyperbolic trajectory and significant non-gravitational acceleration. Notably, its passage around Jupiter is predicted to occur in 2026, with a close approach of 53.445 million kilometres.</p>

<p>From July to November 2025, observations confirmed the presence of sunward jets, a feature that contradicts established cometary physics. Photometric data indicated a periodic brightness variation, initially thought to signify rotation, which subsequent imaging revealed to be linked to a surrounding coma.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The extraordinary nature of 3I/ATLAS has triggered intense debate,” said a spokesperson from NASA. “We are mobilizing our observational resources to better understand this object.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“If the data holds, we may need to rethink how we classify comets and small celestial bodies,” noted a leading astronomer involved in the research.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object, following 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Unlike its predecessors, 3I/ATLAS displays characteristics that suggest it may represent a new class of celestial body, potentially reshaping the understanding of interstellar objects and their formation processes.</p>

<p>This discovery may also provide insights into the chemistry of distant protoplanetary disks and the materials that circulate in the galaxy.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and its partners will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS using various observatories. Detailed spectroscopic analyses aim to track changes in its outgassing and chemical composition as it moves away from the Sun. Findings from these observations could lead to significant advancements in the understanding of planetary formation and the diversity of small bodies in the galaxy.</p>
