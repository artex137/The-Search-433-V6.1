      <h2>NASA Announces Release of Multi-Mission Imagery for Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Greenbelt, Maryland – November 19, 2025 – The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has announced the release of a comprehensive collection of images and data related to Comet 3I/ATLAS during a live teleconference today at 3:00 p.m. EST (20:00 UTC). The event, hosted at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, will showcase contributions from multiple agency missions, including space-based telescopes and spacecraft.</p>

<p>This release is significant as it provides unprecedented multi-vantage observations of Comet 3I/ATLAS, which is the third confirmed interstellar object to traverse the solar system. Discovered on July 1, 2025, by the NASA-funded Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope in Río Hurtado, Chile, the comet's hyperbolic trajectory confirms its interstellar origin. It is projected to make its closest approach to Earth at approximately 170 million miles (270 million kilometers) in December 2025.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event time: November 19, 2025, at 3:00 p.m. EST (20:00 UTC)</li>
    <li>Location: NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland</li>
    <li>Discovery date: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 2025, at 170 million miles (270 million kilometers)</li>
    <li>Perihelion date: October 30, 2025, at 1.4 astronomical units (130 million miles or 210 million kilometers)</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Mars: Early October 2025, at 19 million miles (30 million kilometers)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile. Following its discovery, NASA's Hubble Space Telescope captured detailed images on July 21, revealing a teardrop-shaped dust cocoon around the nucleus. The comet reached perihelion on October 30, 2025, and passed near Mars in early October 2025, allowing for close-range observations. Various NASA missions have monitored the comet continuously, providing valuable data on its activity.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“These observations represent a unique opportunity to advance our understanding of interstellar visitors,” said a NASA spokesperson.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS joins 1I/'Oumuamua, discovered in 2017, and 2I/Borisov, discovered in 2019, as one of the few verified interstellar objects entering the solar system. The study of such comets is critical for understanding galactic chemistry and the formation of exoplanetary systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its outbound journey, passing near Jupiter in early 2026, further data analysis is expected to yield publications in the coming months. The live event will be streamed on multiple platforms, allowing experts to discuss the imagery and answer public questions.</p>
