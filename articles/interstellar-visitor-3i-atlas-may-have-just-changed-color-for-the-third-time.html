      <h2>Interstellar visitor 3I/ATLAS may have just changed color — for the third time</h2>

<p>Recent observations have shown that the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has developed a faint bluish hue, indicating a potential color change. This marks the third time experts have noted a shift in the comet's color since its discovery earlier this year.</p>

<p>This development is significant as it may provide insights into the composition and behavior of comets from outside our solar system. Authorities and researchers are closely monitoring the comet, which has exhibited unusual characteristics since it was first identified.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Current speed: over 130,000 mph (210,000 km/h)</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the sun: Oct. 29, at a distance of 130 million miles (210 million kilometers)</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: Dec. 19, at 168 million miles (270 million kilometers)</li>
    <li>Initial color observed: red in July; potential change to green in September; now bluish</li>
    <li>Time of discovery: Early July 2023</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first spotted in early July 2023, traveling towards the sun. In September, the comet appeared to shift to a green color, likely due to the presence of dicarbon or cyanide. On Oct. 29, it reached perihelion, while hidden from Earth, and brightened unexpectedly. Observations now suggest it may exhibit a bluish hue.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The comet appears to be distinctly bluer than the sun,” researchers stated in a recent paper, noting the unexpected nature of this coloration.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This comet is the third known interstellar object to visit our solar system. It is believed to be more than 7 billion years old, ejected from its home star system in the Milky Way's frontier. Previous observations have revealed 3I/ATLAS exhibits an unusual abundance of carbon dioxide and high levels of water leakage, raising questions about its origins.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth, researchers expect to gather more data and insights into the comet's behavior. It will become increasingly visible to stargazers in the Northern Hemisphere over the coming weeks, though it will require telescopes or binoculars for observation.</p>
