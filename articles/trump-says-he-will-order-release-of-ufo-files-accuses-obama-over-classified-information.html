      <h2>Trump says he will order release of UFO files, accuses Obama over classified information</h2>

<p>Donald Trump has announced that he will direct federal agencies to start releasing documents related to aliens and unidentified flying objects (UFOs), citing public interest in the topic. Trump made the statement on social media, indicating he would instruct Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and other agencies to disclose information on what he called an “extremely interesting and important” matter.</p>

<p>This announcement comes amid ongoing discussions about government transparency regarding UFOs. Trump has claimed that former President Barack Obama improperly handled classified information related to aliens, although he did not provide evidence to support this assertion.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Trump announced his intentions in a social media post.</li>
  <li>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth will be involved in the release of documents.</li>
  <li>Trump criticized Obama during a trip to Georgia.</li>
  <li>Obama responded to UFO questions in a podcast interview released on Saturday.</li>
  <li>Area 51, a U.S. Air Force facility, has been central to UFO conspiracy theories.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Trump's announcement of document disclosures has followed a series of public comments regarding UFOs and extraterrestrial life:</p>
<ul>
  <li>On Saturday, Obama addressed UFOs during an interview on Brian Tyler Cohen's podcast, stating, “They’re real, but I haven’t seen them, and they’re not being kept in … Area 51.”</li>
  <li>Trump criticized Obama while traveling in Georgia, suggesting the former president disclosed unauthorized information.</li>
  <li>Trump's social media post outlining his directive to federal agencies has been released.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It’s a big mistake,” Trump said regarding Obama’s handling of classified information. “I don’t know if they’re real or not.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Obama stated, “I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials had made contact with Earth,” adding that while life may exist elsewhere, the vast distances make it unlikely that such life has reached Earth.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discussion around UFOs and government transparency has gained traction in recent years, particularly after the release of CIA archives in 2013, which identified Area 51 as a testing ground for spy planes, rather than a site for alien-related activities. Public interest has surged following numerous reports of unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Federal agencies are expected to begin the process of releasing documents related to UFOs, as outlined by Trump. Further comments from Obama’s office are pending regarding the allegations made by Trump.</p>
