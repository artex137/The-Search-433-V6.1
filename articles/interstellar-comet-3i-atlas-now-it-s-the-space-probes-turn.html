      <p class="byline">Published 2025-10-06 12:27 UTC</p>

      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS: Now it's the space probes' turn</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has passed Mars, prompting various space probes and research equipment to undertake observation campaigns, according to communications from the European Space Agency (ESA) and NASA. The comet was discovered in July with the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Chile.</p>

<p>This observation effort is significant as the comet cannot currently be seen from Earth. The closest approach to the sun, known as perihelion, is expected at the end of October. The ESA plans to utilize its spacecraft to maximize data collection during this period.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS has passed Mars and is currently behind the sun from Earth's perspective.</li>
    <li>ESA's Mars Express and TGO orbiters are set to observe the comet on 3 October.</li>
    <li>NASA's Perseverance and Curiosity rovers will also participate in the observation efforts.</li>
    <li>More than a dozen missions are planned to study 3I/ATLAS.</li>
    <li>NASA plans to utilize the Hubble, James Webb, and TESS space telescopes, among others.</li>
    <li>The perihelion of 3I/ATLAS will occur at the end of October.</li>
    <li>Initial analyses suggest the comet is older than Earth, the sun, and the solar system.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2023 by ATLAS in Chile. Following its discovery, researchers called for observations using various probes across the solar system. On 3 October, ESA's Mars Express and TGO orbiters began their observation campaigns. NASA's rovers, Perseverance and Curiosity, are also set to gather data on the comet.</p>

<p>The upcoming perihelion at the end of October will see ESA's Jupiter probe, Juice, involved in observing 3I/ATLAS. The specific timing of NASA's observations, including those from Hubble and James Webb, has not been disclosed.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The passage of the interstellar comet through the solar system could serve as an opportunity to prepare a mission that could visit a similar celestial body in the future,” ESA officials stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar visitor discovered in the solar system, following 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Its speed surpasses that of these previous visitors, suggesting it originates from the outskirts of the Milky Way.</p>

<p>The interest in observing 3I/ATLAS is particularly high due to its potential for providing insights into the composition of interstellar bodies, especially as it loses material close to the sun.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>ESA and NASA will continue their observation campaigns, with data collection expected to yield valuable insights into the comet's composition. The impacts of the US government's current budget freeze on NASA's planned observations remain unclear.</p>
