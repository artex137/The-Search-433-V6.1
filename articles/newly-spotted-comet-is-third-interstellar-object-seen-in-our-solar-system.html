      <h2>Newly Spotted Comet Is Third Interstellar Object Seen in Our Solar System</h2>

<p>A newly discovered comet, designated 3I ATLAS, has been identified as the third interstellar object observed in our solar system. The comet was detected on October 11, 2023, by astronomers using data from the Pan-STARRS 2 telescope in Hawaii.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it adds to the growing list of interstellar objects that have passed through our solar system, providing valuable insights into the composition and behavior of celestial bodies from outside our solar system. Astronomers are currently monitoring the comet's trajectory and characteristics to better understand its origins and potential impact on future studies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet designation: 3I ATLAS</li>
    <li>Date of discovery: October 11, 2023</li>
    <li>Location of detection: Pan-STARRS 2 telescope, Hawaii</li>
    <li>Significance: Third interstellar object observed in our solar system</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 11, 2023, astronomers at the Pan-STARRS 2 telescope made the discovery of comet 3I ATLAS. This comet follows the earlier interstellar objects, 1I/‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, which were detected in 2017 and 2019, respectively. Observations of 3I ATLAS are ongoing as scientists analyze its trajectory and physical properties.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The discovery of 3I ATLAS is an exciting development in our understanding of interstellar objects,” said a representative from the Pan-STARRS 2 team. “It opens up new avenues for research into the origins of these celestial bodies.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The detection of interstellar objects has become a focal point of astronomical research, with 1I/‘Oumuamua being the first such object identified in 2017. Its unusual shape and trajectory sparked various theories about its origins. The subsequent discovery of 2I/Borisov in 2019 confirmed that these objects are not rare, prompting further investigation into their characteristics and implications for astrophysics.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor comet 3I ATLAS as it moves through the solar system, gathering data to enhance our understanding of interstellar objects and their potential impact on our solar environment.</p>
