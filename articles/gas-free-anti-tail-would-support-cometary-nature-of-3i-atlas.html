      <h2>Gas-free anti-tail would support cometary nature of 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>On January 1, 2026, a study by Avi Loeb published on Medium has examined the behaviour of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, focusing on its gas and dust emissions from a pronounced anti-tail jet. The analysis follows recent observations made with a 0.2-metre telescope in Belgium, which captured images of the object on December 19 and 27, 2025.</p>

<p>This research is significant as it may clarify whether 3I/ATLAS is a natural comet or influenced by a technological propulsion system. Authorities are now considering targeted observations to gather more data about the object’s composition and behaviour.</p>

</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In December 2025, astronomers used a 0.2-metre telescope in Belgium to observe 3I/ATLAS. Images taken on December 19 and 27 revealed a significant anti-tail extending several hundred thousand kilometres sunward. The analysis published on January 1, 2026, by Avi Loeb explores the implications of these observations.</p>

<p>The study suggests that if 3I/ATLAS behaves like an ordinary comet, gas will only be present within approximately 5,000 kilometres from the nucleus. Beyond this threshold, the anti-tail should consist mainly of dust grains. Conversely, if the jet is driven by technological means, gas could extend much farther.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“If 3I/ATLAS is an ordinary comet powered by CO₂ sublimation, the anti-tail should contain streaming gas only within a region of order 5,000 kilometres from the nucleus,” said Avi Loeb in the analysis.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This research builds on existing models of comet behaviour, specifically the dynamics of gas and dust emissions. Prior studies have established that dust grains can be accelerated by outflowing gas, allowing them to travel significant distances before being affected by solar radiation pressure. The analysis of 3I/ATLAS aims to further investigate these established theories and their applicability to this interstellar object.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further observations are planned using ground-based facilities such as Keck, the Very Large Telescope and ALMA, as well as space observatories like SPHEREx and the James Webb Space Telescope. These observations aim to map gas and dust along the anti-tail, which could provide crucial evidence about the mechanisms driving the emissions from 3I/ATLAS.</p>
