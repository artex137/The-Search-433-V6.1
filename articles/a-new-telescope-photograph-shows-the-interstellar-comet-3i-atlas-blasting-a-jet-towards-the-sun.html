      <h2>A new telescope photograph shows the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS blasting a jet towards the sun</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has launched a jet of material toward the sun, according to observations made on August 2 using the Two-meter Twin Telescope at Teide Observatory in Tenerife, one of the Canary Islands. The comet is set to make its closest approach to the sun on October 30, passing within 1.8 astronomical units of Earth.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as it highlights the behavior of comets as they approach the sun. The Astronomer's Telegram, an announcement service for astronomers, informed the community about the jet on October 15. This event provides valuable data on the dynamics of interstellar comets and their interactions with solar radiation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object in the solar system.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the sun is scheduled for October 30.</li>
    <li>The comet will pass within 1.8 astronomical units of Earth.</li>
    <li>The jet is composed of dust and carbon dioxide particles.</li>
    <li>The jet has been observed to be up to 10,000 km from the comet's surface.</li>
    <li>The observations were made using 159 exposures of 50 seconds each.</li>
    <li>The data was shared by Robert Rutledge, editor-in-chief of the Astronomer's Telegram.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On August 2, the Two-meter Twin Telescope captured images of comet 3I/ATLAS, revealing a jet of material directed toward the sun.</p>
<p>On October 15, the Astronomer's Telegram announced the findings to the astronomy community.</p>
<p>The comet is expected to reach its closest point to the sun on October 30, 2023.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "This is the usual," said Miquel Serra-Ricart, astrophysicist and chief science officer at Teide Observatory. "Comets do warm up as they approach the sun, but not all of their locations warm up in the same way."
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable as it is the third interstellar object identified in our solar system, following previous discoveries. Observations of comets, such as the Hubble Space Telescope's imaging of C/2020 F3 NEOWISE in 2020, have shown similar behavior in response to solar radiation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further observations are anticipated as the comet approaches the sun, providing more data on its behavior and characteristics. The upcoming closest approach will allow astronomers to study the comet's jet and coma in greater detail.</p>
