      <h2>The Cosmic Traveller 3I/ATLAS Opens Window to Alien Worlds</h2>

<p>New Delhi: The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, only the third confirmed object known to arrive from beyond our Solar System, has generated excitement among astronomers worldwide since its discovery on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile. The comet, officially designated C/2025 N1 (ATLAS), is on a hyperbolic trajectory and will reach its closest point to the Sun around October 30, at approximately 1.4 astronomical units, just inside Mars’ orbit.</p>

<p>This discovery matters because 3I/ATLAS offers scientists a unique opportunity to study material from another star system. As it approaches the Sun, it carries clues about its elemental makeup, which may differ significantly from comets within our own Solar System. Observations have already revealed an unusual chemical composition, with a rich presence of carbon dioxide but a scarcity of water vapour and other common volatiles.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>Officially designated C/2025 N1 (ATLAS).</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun expected around October 30, 2025.</li>
    <li>Travelling at a high velocity, untethered by the Sun’s gravity.</li>
    <li>Comet's nucleus may be over ten kilometres wide.</li>
    <li>Studies show a composition rich in carbon dioxide, nearly devoid of water vapour.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers first spotted 3I/ATLAS as it entered our Solar System from the direction of Sagittarius. Its hyperbolic trajectory confirmed its alien origin, marking it as a significant find in astronomical research. As it approaches the Sun, the comet displays unpredictable behaviour, brightening faster than expected.</p>
<p>In the following months, observations from the James Webb Space Telescope revealed its unique chemical composition, prompting further interest among planetary scientists. Space agencies, including the Hubble Space Telescope team and Mars orbiters, have redirected their instruments to gather data on the comet before it slips away.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS is not just another comet; it is a messenger from a different world, offering a tangible link to other solar systems,” said an astronomer involved in the observation efforts.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS follows a series of previous interstellar objects, including `Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, which have raised questions about the frequency of such visitors to our Solar System. These findings have sparked interest in the study of the origins and compositions of celestial bodies beyond our immediate cosmic neighbourhood.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey, scientists will monitor its behaviour closely and gather data until it moves beyond Mars’ orbit. This research may provide valuable insights into the formation of other solar systems and the potential for unseen interstellar objects passing through our vicinity.</p>
