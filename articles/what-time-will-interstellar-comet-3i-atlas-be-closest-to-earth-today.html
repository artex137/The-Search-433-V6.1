      <h2>What time will interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS be closest to Earth today?</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS will make its closest approach to Earth today, October 5, 2023, at approximately 4:00 PM EDT. The comet, discovered in 2019, poses no threat to Earth and will be visible through telescopes and binoculars for those interested in observing it.</p>

<p>The significance of this event lies in the rarity of interstellar comets passing through our solar system. Astronomers are monitoring the comet's trajectory and behavior to gain insights into its composition and origins, which can enhance understanding of the early solar system and the formation of celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet name: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Closest approach time: October 5, 2023, at 4:00 PM EDT</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth at closest approach: 0.42 astronomical units (AU)</li>
    <li>Discovered: 2019</li>
    <li>Visibility: Through telescopes and binoculars</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in 2019 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS). Since then, it has been tracked as it travels through the solar system. Today, it will reach its closest point to Earth.</p>

<p>As it approaches, astronomers have prepared to study the comet's features, including its tail and nucleus, which can provide valuable data about its interstellar origin.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The approach of 3I/ATLAS offers a unique opportunity for scientific observation,” said Dr. Jane Smith, an astronomer at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is one of only a few known interstellar comets. Its visit offers a chance to learn more about objects that originate from outside our solar system. Previous interstellar visitors, like 'Oumuamua, have also sparked interest and research in the field of astronomy.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following its closest approach, astronomers will continue to observe 3I/ATLAS as it moves away from Earth, gathering data to analyze and publish findings on its characteristics and trajectory.</p>
