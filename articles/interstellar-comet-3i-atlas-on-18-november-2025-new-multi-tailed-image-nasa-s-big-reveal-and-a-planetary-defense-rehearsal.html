      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS on 18 November 2025: New Multi‑Tailed Image, NASA’s Big Reveal and a Planetary‑Defense Rehearsal</h2>

<p>On 18 November 2025, astronomers have announced significant developments regarding interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, including the release of a new multi-tailed image and plans for a live global broadcast by NASA. NASA will unveil the sharpest images of the comet from multiple spacecraft and telescopes during an event scheduled for 19 November at 3 p.m. EST from Goddard Space Flight Center. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities linked to this event.</p>

<p>These announcements highlight the importance of 3I/ATLAS as a test case for planetary defense against potential cosmic threats. The European Space Agency (ESA) has reported a significant improvement in the comet's predicted path, enhancing the accuracy of tracking methods that could be crucial for future planetary defense efforts.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date of announcement:</strong> 18 November 2025</li>
    <li><strong>NASA event:</strong> 19 November 2025, 3 p.m. EST</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery date:</strong> 1 July 2025 by ATLAS in Río Hurtado, Chile</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to Earth:</strong> 19 December 2025, approximately 170 million miles (≈270 million km)</li>
    <li><strong>Comet size:</strong> Estimated nucleus size between 0.3–5.6 km</li>
    <li><strong>Current visibility:</strong> Magnitude 9–10 in the constellation Virgo</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS, formally known as C/2025 N1 (ATLAS), was discovered on 1 July 2025 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Chile. It follows a hyperbolic trajectory, indicating it is not bound to the Sun and will not return.</p>
<p>On 3 October 2025, the comet made a close approach to Mars, allowing ESA's ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter to capture astrometric measurements that improved the predicted path of the comet. This marked a significant milestone in planetary defense efforts.</p>
<p>On 18 November 2025, a New Mexico astrophotographer released a striking image of 3I/ATLAS, showcasing its green coma and multi-tailed structure. NASA confirmed its upcoming live event to share further details about the comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We are excited to share the latest images and data from our spacecraft,” said NASA in a media advisory for the upcoming broadcast.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“This exercise demonstrates how we can utilize multiple spacecraft to enhance tracking of fast-moving objects,” stated ESA regarding the comet's trajectory improvements.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object detected in our Solar System, following 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. The comet's discovery has sparked interest in understanding its origins and composition, as well as its implications for planetary defense.</p>
<p>Recent discussions surrounding the comet have included speculation about its nature, with some, like Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb, suggesting it might be something other than a comet. However, most planetary scientists continue to reject these claims, attributing observed phenomena to natural cometary processes.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA's live event on 19 November will provide new insights and visuals of 3I/ATLAS. As it approaches Earth, astronomers will continue to monitor its trajectory and behavior, contributing to ongoing planetary defense research and preparation for future cosmic threats.</p>
