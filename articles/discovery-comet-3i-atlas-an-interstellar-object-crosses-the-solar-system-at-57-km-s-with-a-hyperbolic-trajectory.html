      <h2>Discovery: Comet 3I/Atlas, an interstellar object, crosses the solar system at 57 km/s with a hyperbolic trajectory</h2>

<p>NASA has confirmed the discovery of comet 3I/Atlas, an interstellar object that is currently crossing the Solar System at a speed of 57 kilometers per second. The comet, which has a hyperbolic trajectory, is on a path that will take it beyond the gravitational limits of the Sun without establishing an orbit. Astronomers have been monitoring the comet closely since its detection on November 23, 2025.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as 3I/Atlas is the third confirmed interstellar object detected, providing a unique opportunity to study materials from outside our solar neighborhood. Detailed observations are scheduled to intensify as astronomers aim to gather more data before the comet moves away permanently.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet designation: 3I/Atlas</li>
    <li>Speed: 57 km/s</li>
    <li>Orbit type: Hyperbolic</li>
    <li>First detection: November 23, 2025</li>
    <li>Confirmed as third interstellar object</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The detection of 3I/Atlas began on November 23, 2025. Since then, astronomers have closely monitored its trajectory and speed. The comet is expected to make its closest approach to the Sun in the coming days, coinciding with a major observation window.</p>

<p>Observations have included the collection of spectroscopic data, which has revealed a unique chemical composition that differs from typical Solar System comets.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The speed and trajectory of 3I/Atlas significantly differentiate it from common Solar System comets, offering a rare opportunity to understand its origin and composition,” said a spokesperson for the European Southern Observatory (ESO).</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas is the third confirmed interstellar object, following Oumuamua, detected in 2017, and comet Borisov, observed in 2019. Oumuamua reached a speed of 26 km/s, while Borisov traveled at 33 km/s. The higher speed of 3I/Atlas suggests it may originate from a different stellar environment.</p>

<p>The increased frequency of detected interstellar objects indicates that these visitors may be more common than previously thought, with models predicting up to seven such visits to the Solar System annually.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to gather data on 3I/Atlas as it approaches the Sun. Ongoing observations will refine orbital parameters, allowing researchers to maximize information collection during the comet’s brief passage through the Solar System.</p>
