      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Could Be Investigated by Spacecraft as It Approaches the Sun</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, discovered on July 1, 2023, by the ATLAS (Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System), is set to pass within the orbit of Mars and could be studied by several spacecraft as it approaches the sun. This interstellar comet is believed to originate from outside our solar system, offering scientists a unique opportunity to analyze material that predates our planetary system.</p>

<p>The investigation of Comet 3I/ATLAS is significant because it may provide insights into the early universe, specifically during a period referred to as "cosmic noon." Researchers have indicated that 3I/ATLAS could be up to 7 billion years old, making it at least 2.5 billion years older than our sun and its planets. Authorities are currently assessing which spacecraft can observe the comet during its perihelion, when it will be closest to the sun and shedding material.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered on July 1, 2023.</li>
    <li>Estimated to be up to 7 billion years old.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth expected on December 19, 2025, at a distance of 268 million km.</li>
    <li>Will pass within the orbit of Mars.</li>
    <li>NASA's Psyche and ESA's JUICE are in position to observe the comet.</li>
    <li>Three Mars orbiters, including Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, will also have vantage points.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2023. As it approached the sun, scientists began to assess its trajectory and potential for investigation. The comet is expected to reach perihelion on its course, shedding material as it comes closer to the sun. The closest approach to Earth is projected for December 19, 2025.</p>

<p>As the comet nears perihelion, spacecraft including NASA's Psyche and ESA's JUICE will be positioned to gather data. Earth-based telescopes will be unable to observe 3I/ATLAS during this critical period due to its location behind the sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The Earth and its satellites, including our space telescopes, are poorly situated to observe 3I/ATLAS when it is closest to the sun,” said T. Marshall Eubanks, Chief Scientist at Space Initiatives Inc. “The period at and just after perihelion is when a comet is heated the most and throws off the most material.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Thanks to its Venus gravity assist on Aug. 31, JUICE will be in the best position for the important period around the 3I/ATLAS perihelion,” Eubanks added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is only the third known interstellar object to enter our solar system, following 'Oumuamua and Comet Borisov. Its unique composition and age provide scientists with a rare opportunity to study materials that formed long before the solar system. Understanding such interstellar bodies can enhance knowledge of planetary formation and the evolution of the universe.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the comet approaches perihelion, researchers will continue to monitor its trajectory and prepare spacecraft for observation opportunities. The data collected during this period will be crucial for understanding the composition and behavior of interstellar comets.</p>
