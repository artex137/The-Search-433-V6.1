      <h2>Historical record of the Tianwen-1 probe reveals details of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS near Mars</h2>

<p>The Chinese probe Tianwen-1 has successfully captured high-definition images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS while orbiting Mars in October 2025, according to the Administração Espacial Nacional of China (CNSA). This marks the first time an interstellar body has been photographed in such detail from the orbit of another planet.</p>

<p>This achievement is significant for the global scientific community, as it provides crucial information about the composition, structure, and trajectory of cosmic visitors. The data will enhance understanding of planetary formation processes and galactic dynamics, offering insights into materials formed around other stars.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event occurred in October 2025.</li>
    <li>The Tianwen-1 probe is in orbit around Mars.</li>
    <li>Distance from the comet during imaging was approximately 30 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS has an estimated diameter of 5.6 kilometers.</li>
    <li>The comet is moving at a speed of 58 kilometers per second.</li>
    <li>Comet’s tail extended approximately 56,000 kilometers during observations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2020, the Tianwen-1 mission was launched, marking China’s first attempt to send an orbiter, a lander, and a rover to Mars. The probe entered Martian orbit in February 2021.</p>

<p>The Zhurong rover landed on Utopia Planitia in May 2021 and operated for nearly a year, gathering geological and atmospheric data. In October 2025, Tianwen-1 successfully captured images of comet 3I/ATLAS, showcasing advanced navigation and imaging capabilities.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The data obtained is considered invaluable to the global scientific community,” said a CNSA spokesperson, highlighting the importance of the mission in understanding interstellar bodies.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object formally identified, following ‘Oumuamua in 2017 and comet 2I/Borisov in 2019. Each of these objects provides a unique glimpse into the diversity of planetary systems in the Milky Way.</p>

<p>China's Tianwen-1 mission represents a milestone for the country's space program, demonstrating its capabilities in deep space exploration and enhancing its position as a leader in the field.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Future investigations will focus on the analysis of spectral data collected by Tianwen-1, as well as collaboration with other agencies like the European Space Agency and NASA. The successful observation of 3I/ATLAS validates technologies for upcoming missions, including the Tianwen-2 mission aimed at asteroid and comet exploration.</p>
