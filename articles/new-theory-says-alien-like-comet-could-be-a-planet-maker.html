      <h2>New theory says alien-like comet could be a planet maker</h2>

<p>Researchers have proposed a new theory suggesting that the interstellar comet 3I ATLAS may play a role in the formation of planets. This theory has emerged as scientists continue to study the comet, which was first detected in December 2019 as it passed through our solar system. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in relation to this discovery.</p>

<p>This research is significant as it may change our understanding of how planets form in the universe. Scientists are currently analyzing data collected from 3I ATLAS to explore its potential contributions to planetary formation. The findings could have implications for the study of other interstellar objects as well.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I ATLAS was first detected in December 2019.</li>
    <li>It is classified as an interstellar object.</li>
    <li>Researchers are examining its potential role in planet formation.</li>
    <li>No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</li>
    <li>Findings could impact the study of other interstellar objects.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In December 2019, astronomers detected 3I ATLAS as it made its way through the solar system. Since then, scientists have been studying its composition and trajectory to understand its origins and implications for planetary formation.</p>

<p>As of now, researchers have conducted several analyses based on the data collected from the comet, leading to the new theory regarding its potential role in creating planets.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The discovery of 3I ATLAS has opened new avenues for understanding the processes involved in planet formation,” said a lead researcher involved in the study.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I ATLAS is one of several interstellar objects observed by scientists. Previous studies of other interstellar comets have provided insights into the materials that may contribute to planetary systems beyond our own. This research continues to evolve as new data becomes available.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze the data from 3I ATLAS to further explore its properties and its implications for planetary formation in the universe.</p>
