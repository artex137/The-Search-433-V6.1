      <h2>Comet C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) Breaks Apart, Stunning Images Released</h2>
<p>Telescopes have captured the dramatic breakup of Comet C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) as it journeys through the Solar System. Images from the Gemini North telescope in Hawaii show the comet disintegrating into multiple fragments between November 11 and December 6, 2025.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it highlights the fragile nature of comets, which can break apart during their close approaches to the Sun. Astronomers are analyzing the images to understand the processes involved in the disintegration of celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) was identified in May 2025.</li>
    <li>Perihelion occurred on October 8, 2025, at a distance of 49 million kilometers (30 million miles) from the Sun.</li>
    <li>Images show the comet breaking apart between November 11 and December 6, 2025.</li>
    <li>As of February 2, 2026, the estimated magnitude of K1 (ATLAS) is approximately 27.17.</li>
    <li>The comet originated from the Oort cloud.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) was first identified in May 2025 using the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System. It made its closest approach to the Sun on October 8, 2025, initially surviving the encounter and brightening to a magnitude of 9.</p>
<p>On November 11, 2025, the comet began to crumble into pieces, with images captured on December 6 showing continued disintegration. The comet is now believed to be in its final stages as it recedes from the Sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The images reveal the nucleus splitting into at least three or four major fragments, trailing a shimmering wake of dust and debris,” said B. Bolin from the International Gemini Observatory.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) is part of a larger population of comets that originate in the Oort cloud, a distant region of the Solar System. This event follows previous observations of comets that have also disintegrated during close solar encounters, underscoring the dynamic and often unstable nature of these icy bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to monitor the remnants of Comet C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) as it fades into a diffuse cloud of debris, providing insights into the processes of comet disintegration and the evolution of such celestial bodies.</p>
