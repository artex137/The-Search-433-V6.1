      <h2>Infrared polarimetry reveals unique primitive dust on interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>A new independent study has presented polarimetric observations of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, revealing the first near-infrared measurements of the object since its identification on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope system in Chile. The study shows that the polarization characteristics of 3I/ATLAS differ significantly from typical Solar System comets, indicating that its dust reflects intrinsic optical properties rather than transient volatile activity.</p>

<p>This research is significant as it enhances understanding of the formation processes of celestial bodies in various protoplanetary disks. The findings suggest that 3I/ATLAS preserves characteristics of a primitive cometary planetesimal from another distant planetary system, highlighting the diversity of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was identified on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>It is the third confirmed interstellar object to visit the Solar System, after 1I/’Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov.</li>
    <li>Perihelion occurred within the water snowline with no significant changes in observed polarization.</li>
    <li>The polarization phase curve of 3I/ATLAS has a greater amplitude than the average of Solar System comets.</li>
    <li>Measurements covered wavelengths from 0.64 µm to 2.25 µm.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the ATLAS telescope system in Chile identified comet 3I/ATLAS. Following its detection, intense observations began, leading to the collection of data before and after perihelion. The study utilized imaging polarimeters to analyze the degree of linear polarization across various wavelengths.</p>

<p>The research team confirmed that the polarization amplitude recorded was exceptionally large, with stable properties maintained throughout the comet's orbit, even when it passed close to the Sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The polarimetric behavior of 3I/ATLAS suggests that its dust particles are primarily composed of refractory materials, differing from the typical volatile characteristics observed in most Solar System comets,” researchers stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior studies of interstellar comets have shown varying characteristics in dust composition and behavior. 3I/ATLAS stands out due to its stable polarization properties, which challenge the understanding established by previous observations of comets like 1I/’Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further investigations will continue to explore the properties of 3I/ATLAS, aiming to deepen the understanding of its origins and implications for the study of primitive celestial materials. The research team plans to publish additional findings based on ongoing observations and data analysis.</p>
