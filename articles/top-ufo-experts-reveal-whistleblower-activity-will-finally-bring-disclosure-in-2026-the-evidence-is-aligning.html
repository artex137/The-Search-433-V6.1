      <h2>Top UFO Experts Predict 2026 Disclosure</h2>

<p>A surge of whistleblower activity and new congressional mandates have led experts to predict that the United States will experience its first true UFO disclosure in 2026. This assessment comes from researchers who believe that military and intelligence insiders are now ready to testify publicly, making secrecy increasingly difficult to maintain.</p>

<p>The significance of this potential disclosure stems from mounting political pressure and legislative action. The 2026 National Defense Authorization Act requires new briefings on Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) encounters dating back to 2004. It also mandates a review of whether key UFO-related data has been over-classified or improperly withheld from lawmakers.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Experts predict a significant UFO disclosure in 2026, according to researchers.</li>
    <li>The National Defense Authorization Act for 2026 mandates briefings on UAP encounters since 2004.</li>
    <li>The documentary "The Age of Disclosure" features 34 current and former officials discussing a decades-long UFO cover-up.</li>
    <li>Whistleblower David Grusch has alleged that the US government possesses secret programs for recovering extraterrestrial spacecraft.</li>
    <li>Missouri Congressman Eric Burlison has suggested new UFO whistleblowers may come forward soon.</li>
    <li>Mark Christopher Lee described 2026 as a pivotal year for UFO disclosure due to escalating congressional momentum.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In November 2025, the documentary "The Age of Disclosure" was released, showcasing testimonies from military and intelligence officials about a long-standing UFO cover-up. Following this, Congress enacted the 2026 National Defense Authorization Act, which includes requirements for transparency on UAP encounters and reviews of classified data.</p>
<p>Throughout early 2026, whistleblower David Grusch has continued to advise congressional caucuses, adding pressure for disclosure. His claims about government programs related to extraterrestrial technology have further fueled public interest.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The fiscal year 2026 National Defense Authorization Act includes key provisions mandating the Pentagon's All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office to brief Congress on UAP intercepts since 2004,” said Mark Christopher Lee. “Much now depends on how far the current administration is willing to go in revealing some of the nation’s most closely guarded secrets.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This potential disclosure follows decades of speculation and inquiry into UFOs and UAPs. Previous government releases of UFO files have not provided definitive proof of extraterrestrial visitors, according to skeptics. These claims have led to a mixture of public interest and skepticism regarding the reality of UFO phenomena.</p>
<p>Notably, the cultural landscape has shifted, with increasing media coverage and speculation about the government's handling of UAPs. The upcoming release of Steven Spielberg's film "Disclosure Day" has generated further interest in the topic, with some believing it may coincide with actual disclosures.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 2026 approaches, investigations into UAP encounters will continue, alongside ongoing efforts to amend the UAP Disclosure Act. The current political climate suggests that significant revelations regarding UFOs and the government's response to UAPs may be forthcoming.</p>
