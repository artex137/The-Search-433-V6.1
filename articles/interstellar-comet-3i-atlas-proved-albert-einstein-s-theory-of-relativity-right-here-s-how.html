      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS confirms Einstein's theory of relativity</h2>

<p>An interstellar comet named 3I/ATLAS has confirmed a principle of Albert Einstein's theory of relativity as it reached its closest point to the sun on 29 October 2023. The comet, which originated outside the solar system, exhibited gravitational lensing, a phenomenon predicted by Einstein in 1915.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it validates Einstein's theory and provides new insights into the behavior of light in strong gravitational fields. According to a report by Daily Mail, the scans of 3I/ATLAS revealed that the sun's gravity bent the light from the comet, leading to a shift in its apparent position in the sky.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to the sun on 29 October 2023.</li>
    <li>It reached a distance of approximately 126 million miles (203 million kilometers) from the sun.</li>
    <li>The comet is expected to be visible to telescope users around 11 November 2023.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will make its closest approach to Earth on 19 December 2023, coming within about 270 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>The data was obtained by the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) and solar observatories including STEREO, SOHO, and GOES-19.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS, an interstellar comet, has been a subject of study since its discovery. Here are key events:</p>
<ul>
    <li>29 October 2023: 3I/ATLAS makes its closest approach to the sun.</li>
    <li>11 November 2023: The comet is expected to be visible to telescope users.</li>
    <li>19 December 2023: 3I/ATLAS will make its closest approach to Earth.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The related data was obtained by the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), which indicated that 3I/ATLAS was 4 arcseconds away in Right Ascension from where it was supposed to be near perihelion according to its forecasted trajectory,” said Harvard physicist Avi Loeb.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Observations of 3I/ATLAS close to perihelion by the solar observatories STEREO, SOHO and GOES-19 revealed unprecedented brightening and a color bluer than the sun,” Loeb added.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Its gas plume contains 4% water by mass,” Loeb noted in his findings.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The observation of 3I/ATLAS is part of ongoing research into gravitational lensing, which has been a key focus in astrophysics since Einstein's formulation of general relativity. This event serves as a practical demonstration of theoretical concepts that have been under investigation for over a century.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to study 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth, with further observations planned for its closest approach on 19 December 2023. This ongoing research may yield additional insights into the comet's composition and behavior.</p>
