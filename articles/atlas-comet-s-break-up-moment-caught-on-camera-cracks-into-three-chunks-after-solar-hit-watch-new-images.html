      <h2>Comet C2025 K1 ATLAS Breaks Apart After Close Solar Approach</h2>
<p>Comet C2025 K1 ATLAS has begun to break apart after its close approach to the Sun on October 8, 2025, as confirmed by astronomers at Italy's Asiago Observatory. The initial signs of the comet's fragmentation emerged on November 11, when researchers detected distortions in its structure using the Copernicus telescope.</p>

<p>This event is significant for astronomers worldwide, as it provides a rare opportunity to study the composition and behavior of long-period comets originating from the Kuiper Belt. Observatories are mobilizing to gather detailed data on the fragments before they disperse further into space.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet C2025 K1 ATLAS is breaking apart after its perihelion on October 8, 2025.</li>
    <li>The first signs of fragmentation were observed on November 11 at the Asiago Observatory.</li>
    <li>The comet's nucleus has split into at least three fragments, with two main pieces separated by nearly 2,000 kilometres.</li>
    <li>High-resolution images were captured using the 182-metre Copernicus telescope.</li>
    <li>Experts believe the breakup was triggered by intense heat and rapid sublimation from the Sun.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 8, 2025, Comet C2025 K1 ATLAS made its closest approach to the Sun, known as perihelion. This event triggered intense heat, leading to rapid sublimation of the comet's frozen gases.</p>
<p>On November 11, astronomers at the Asiago Observatory detected distortions in the comet's structure. A day later, further observations confirmed that the nucleus had split into multiple fragments.</p>
<p>By November 13, astronomer Gianluca Masi from the Virtual Telescope Project captured images showing the fragments rapidly changing positions, indicating the ongoing breakup process.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>"The breakup of C2025 K1 ATLAS offers a rare chance to observe pristine matter from the early solar system," said Italian astronomer Mazzotta-Epifani, who analyzed the initial images.</blockquote>
<blockquote>"These events are characteristic of fragile comets from the Kuiper Belt that cannot withstand the internal pressure after close solar passes," noted experts cited by Spacecom.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet C2025 K1 ATLAS is believed to originate from the Kuiper Belt, a region filled with primordial icy bodies. Its breakup is significant as it allows scientists to study materials that have remained largely unchanged for billions of years.</p>
<p>This incident follows a trend of increased interest in comets, particularly those from the Kuiper Belt, which have provided valuable insights into the early solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Observatories worldwide are racing to collect detailed data on the fragments of C2025 K1 ATLAS before they disperse further into space, which could yield important information about the composition of long-period comets.</p>
