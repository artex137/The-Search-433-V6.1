      <h2>Three Green Comets Are Heading Our Way Right Now – Including The Best Of 2025</h2>

<p>This month, three green comets—C/2025 A6 Lemmon, C/2025 R2 SWAN, and C/2025 K1 ATLAS—are visible in the western sky, with C/2025 A6 Lemmon expected to be the brightest. The comets, discovered in 2023, will become increasingly observable over the next few weeks, particularly C/2025 A6 Lemmon on October 21, when it will be closest to Earth.</p>

<p>The visibility of these comets is significant for astronomers and enthusiasts. C/2025 A6 Lemmon is anticipated to be bright enough to see with the naked eye, while C/2025 R2 SWAN and C/2025 K1 ATLAS will require binoculars or telescopes. Authorities and astronomers encourage the public to observe these celestial events, which offer a unique opportunity for skywatching.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>C/2025 A6 Lemmon closest to Earth on October 21.</li>
    <li>C/2025 R2 SWAN closest to Earth on October 20, at 39 million kilometers (24 million miles).</li>
    <li>C/2025 A6 Lemmon discovered at the beginning of 2023.</li>
    <li>C/2025 R2 SWAN discovered in October 2023.</li>
    <li>C/2025 K1 ATLAS discovered in 2023.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>C/2025 A6 Lemmon was discovered at the beginning of 2023. It began to rapidly brighten in August, leading to expectations of increased visibility. On October 21, it will be closest to Earth, making it an excellent viewing opportunity.</p>

<p>C/2025 R2 SWAN was discovered on October 19, 2023, just before reaching its closest point to the Sun. It will be visible after sunset, requiring some magnification for observation.</p>

<p>C/2025 K1 ATLAS is also approaching its closest passage to the Sun. It has been gradually brightening and will be best observed before dawn in the coming weeks.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The visibility of C/2025 A6 Lemmon will make it the best comet of the year,” said an unnamed astronomer.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comets are often unpredictable in their brightness and visibility. The Great Comet of 1997 set a high bar for public interest in comets, and the current visibility of these three green comets presents a rare opportunity for both amateur and professional astronomers.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the comets continue their approach, astronomers will monitor their brightness and trajectories. Observers are encouraged to look west after sunset for C/2025 A6 Lemmon and C/2025 R2 SWAN, while C/2025 K1 ATLAS will be best viewed before dawn.</p>
