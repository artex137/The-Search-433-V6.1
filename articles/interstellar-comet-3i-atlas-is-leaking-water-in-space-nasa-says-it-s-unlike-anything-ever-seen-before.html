      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is leaking water in space, NASA says it’s unlike anything ever seen before</h2>

<p>NASA has reported that the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is releasing water vapor while positioned nearly three times farther from the Sun than Earth. This discovery has astonished astronomers and marks a rare cosmic event.</p>

<p>The release of water vapor from 3I/ATLAS, detected by scientists using NASA’s Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, challenges existing knowledge of cometary behavior. Researchers have noted that this phenomenon occurs in a region typically too cold for ice to sublimate, making it a significant finding in the study of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is releasing approximately 40 kilograms of water every second.</li>
    <li>It is emitting around 1.36 × 10<sup>22</sup> molecules of water per second.</li>
    <li>At least 8% of its surface appears to be active, compared to 3–5% in typical comets.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object, following ‘Oumuamua in 2017 and comet Borisov in 2019.</li>
    <li>The comet’s activity was detected at a distance of about 3 astronomical units from the Sun.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been observed for its unique properties since its identification as an interstellar object. The detection of water vapor began when researchers utilized NASA's Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory.</p>
<p>As scientists studied the comet, they found that the water vapor was produced through a two-step outgassing process, which is rare in interstellar comets. This process allows microscopic ice grains to be released into space, where they warm and sublimate.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    <p>“Every interstellar comet we study tells a different story,” said lead researcher Zexi Xing. “ATLAS’s distant water activity could rewrite existing cometary models.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS contributes to a growing understanding of interstellar comets and their role in the solar system. Unlike its predecessors, which either lacked water or were rich in carbon, 3I/ATLAS is chemically distinct and highlights the diversity of materials that can form around different stars.</p>
<p>This finding provides insight into how the ingredients for life may be transported across the galaxy, suggesting that interstellar comets could deliver essential water and organic molecules to planetary systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to study 3I/ATLAS to gain further insights into its composition and behavior. These studies may help to illuminate the processes that shape planetary systems and the origins of life in the universe.</p>
