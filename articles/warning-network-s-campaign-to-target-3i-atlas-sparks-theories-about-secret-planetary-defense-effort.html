      <h2>Warning Network's Campaign to Monitor Comet 3I/ATLAS Sparks Theories About Planetary Defense</h2>

<p>The International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) has launched a global campaign to monitor the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which first entered our solar system in July 2025. The campaign began in late November and will continue until January 27, 2026. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this initiative.</p>

<p>This campaign is significant because it aims to improve the collection of accurate astrometry data on 3I/ATLAS. However, the ongoing U.S. government shutdown has limited NASA's participation in this research opportunity, which some experts believe is critical to understanding the comet's behavior and potential implications for planetary defense.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Campaign Duration:</strong> November 2025 - January 27, 2026</li>
    <li><strong>Object:</strong> Comet 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>IAWN Announcement Date:</strong> October 21, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>NASA Shutdown:</strong> Began October 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to Mars:</strong> Two days after the U.S. government shutdown</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, 3I/ATLAS was first detected entering our solar system. On October 21, 2025, the IAWN announced a campaign to monitor the comet, aiming to enhance the accuracy of astrometry data. The U.S. government shutdown commenced on October 1, 2025, limiting NASA’s operational capacity. Following the shutdown, 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to Mars, though it remains unclear if any imagery was captured of the comet during this time.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“NASA’s involvement was essential to the formation of IAWN,” according to an article from the space agency’s website in January 2024. “NASA coordinates IAWN, which includes convening the semi-annual meetings of the steering committee and signatories.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The IAWN is an international collaboration formed to detect, monitor, and characterize potentially hazardous asteroids and Near-Earth Objects (NEOs). Its activities are influenced by global efforts and recommendations from the United Nations. The current U.S. government shutdown has raised concerns about NASA's ability to contribute to significant space-related developments, particularly regarding 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the campaign progresses, astronomers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS's trajectory and behavior. The potential for NASA's Europa Clipper mission to encounter the comet's ion tail remains uncertain, dependent on the resolution of the government shutdown.</p>
