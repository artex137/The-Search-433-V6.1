      <h2>Donald Trump to Reveal UFO Evidence in Upcoming Speech</h2>

<p>Former President Donald Trump is reportedly set to deliver a speech that will unveil decades of alleged UFO evidence, according to Mark Christopher Lee, a British writer and ufologist. Lee claims that an advisor to the Trump administration has informed him that Trump has received approval from world leaders to make a formal announcement regarding unidentified aerial phenomena. The address is anticipated to take place on July 8, marking the 79th anniversary of the Roswell incident.</p>

<p>This speech is significant as it may be the first official acknowledgment of extraterrestrial life by a world leader, according to Lee. Authorities are preparing for the event, which promises to reveal information about unexplained aerial phenomena, materials from purported crash sites, and military witness accounts. Lee asserts that the information disclosed could not be matched to any human technology.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Speech scheduled for July 8, 2023, coinciding with the anniversary of the Roswell incident.</li>
    <li>Claims based on information from a Trump administration advisor.</li>
    <li>Address expected to cover incidents including the 2004 USS Nimitz and 2015 USS Theodore Roosevelt encounters.</li>
    <li>Lee describes the speech as a potential first for any world leader regarding UFO disclosure.</li>
    <li>Trump has reportedly been authorized to disclose information about "forensic analysis of recovered off-world vehicles."</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Mark Christopher Lee revealed the information regarding Trump’s speech in an interview with the Daily Mail. He stated that the address was originally planned for the United Nations General Assembly in September but has since been rescheduled. The urgency of the announcement is attributed to new intelligence developments.</p>

<p>In 2023, former Navy pilot David Fravor testified before Congress about the 2004 USS Nimitz incident, where he encountered an unidentified object while on a training mission off the coast of San Diego. The object was described as a white, 40-foot-long craft that displayed unusual movements.</p>

<p>Additionally, the Pentagon released footage of the 2015 USS Theodore Roosevelt incidents, known as GoFast and Gimbal, which were documented by military personnel using infrared targeting equipment.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“He will confirm that forensic analysis of recovered off-world vehicles and non-human biologics has established their extraterrestrial origin,” Lee claimed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“He will underscore that he is the first president to authorise full disclosure because the American people deserve transparency,” Lee added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discussion around UFOs has gained momentum in recent years, particularly following congressional hearings and military testimonies about unidentified aerial phenomena. The 1947 Roswell incident remains a pivotal event in UFO lore, and recent military encounters have reignited public interest and speculation about extraterrestrial life.</p>

<p>Lee's claims suggest that Trump’s address could reshape the narrative around UFOs and government transparency, potentially impacting public perception and policy related to unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the planned speech approaches, further details may emerge regarding the specific content of Trump’s address. Authorities and officials are expected to monitor public reaction and prepare for potential implications of the announcement on national and global discussions about UFOs and extraterrestrial life.</p>
