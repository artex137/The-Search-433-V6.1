      <h2>Nasa urged to release 3I/ATLAS data as 'alien spaceship' picks up speed</h2>

<p>Growing concern over the comet 3I/ATLAS, described as a Manhattan-sized object speeding toward Earth, has led Florida Republican Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna to call for NASA to release withheld data. Luna made her request on X, emphasizing the importance of understanding this interstellar visitor as it accelerates unexpectedly.</p>

<p>Congresswoman Luna has urged NASA to provide specific observational data and images captured by the HiRISE camera aboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. This data, taken between October 2 and 3, is crucial for understanding the comet's interaction with our solar system. Reports indicate that 3I/ATLAS has increased its speed from 130,000 mph to 152,000 mph, raising questions about its trajectory and the forces acting upon it.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is approximately 12 miles in diameter.</li>
    <li>It has accelerated from 130,000 mph to 152,000 mph.</li>
    <li>The object passed within approximately 30 million kilometers (18.6 million miles) of Mars on October 3, 2025.</li>
    <li>NASA has been asked to release data from the HiRISE camera and other Mars missions.</li>
    <li>Experts believe the comet has traveled from another star over billions of years.</li>
    <li>The object is expected to reach its closest point to Earth in six weeks.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 2 and 3, 2025, images of 3I/ATLAS were captured by the HiRISE camera aboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. In the following weeks, reports emerged that the comet had unexpectedly accelerated, prompting Congresswoman Luna's request for data. The object is anticipated to reach its closest approach to Earth in six weeks.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “I write to request the release of specific observational data related to 3I/ATLAS, recently captured by NASA missions,” Congresswoman Luna stated on X.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “This information is of great importance to advancing our understanding of interstellar visitors and their interaction with our solar system,” she added.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has generated interest among scientists due to its unusual acceleration and trajectory. While NASA attributes the speed increase to the sun's gravitational pull, experts are still investigating the cause of its deviation from expected paths. Theoretical physicist Avi Loeb has suggested the object could be an "extraterrestrial artifact," raising further questions about its nature and origin.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA is expected to review the request for data from Congresswoman Luna. As 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth, scientists will continue to monitor its trajectory and look for signs of gas emissions that could confirm its classification as a comet.</p>
