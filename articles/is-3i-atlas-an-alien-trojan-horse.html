      <h2>Is 3I/ATLAS an Alien ‘Trojan Horse?’</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has reached its perihelion—the point in its orbit closest to the Sun—on October 29, 2025, drawing attention for its unusual characteristics and a controversial theory linking it to extraterrestrial life. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in relation to the comet.</p>

<p>The unusual properties of 3I/ATLAS have prompted scientists and astronomers to investigate its origins and implications. Notably, Harvard professor Avi Loeb has proposed that the comet may not be a natural object but rather an artifact of intelligent life, suggesting it could be a "Trojan Horse" hiding a potential threat.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS reached perihelion on October 29, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet exhibited a significant brightening in the weeks leading to perihelion.</li>
    <li>NASA's solar observation satellites captured data during the comet's closest approach.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is believed to be one of the largest interstellar objects discovered, estimated to be up to seven billion years old.</li>
    <li>The comet emitted light bluer than the Sun, indicating intense outgassing activity.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 29, 2025, comet 3I/ATLAS reached its perihelion. Leading up to this event, scientists observed an unprecedented brightening pattern that far exceeded typical comet behavior. NASA's satellites collected key data during this time, which revealed the comet's unique light emissions and composition.</p>

<p>Following the perihelion, Avi Loeb proposed a hypothesis suggesting that 3I/ATLAS could potentially be an artificial object rather than a natural comet, raising questions about its origins and implications for extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The rate of luminosity increase of 3I/ATLAS far exceeds that of most comets within our solar system,” said a leading astronomer involved in the study.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “This comet challenges our existing scientific understanding of how comets form and evolve,” stated a NASA representative.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS's unusual properties have sparked discussions reminiscent of previous astronomical events that raised questions about extraterrestrial life. Theories such as those proposed by Loeb have drawn parallels with historical prophecies, including those of the late Bulgarian mystic Baba Vanga, who predicted human contact with alien life.</p>

<p>Previous discoveries of interstellar objects, such as 'Oumuamua, have similarly fueled speculation about their origins and the potential for intelligent life beyond Earth.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists continue to analyze data collected from 3I/ATLAS to better understand its composition and behavior. Ongoing investigations may lead to further insights into the nature of interstellar comets and their implications for life beyond Earth.</p>
