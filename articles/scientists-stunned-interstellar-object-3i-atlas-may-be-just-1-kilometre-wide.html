      <h2>Scientists Stunned: Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS May Be Just 1 Kilometre Wide</h2>

<p>The interstellar object known as 3I/ATLAS has prompted astronomers to reconsider their understanding of objects drifting between star systems. Recent analysis indicates that 3I/ATLAS may measure only one kilometre across, a surprisingly small size given its intense activity. This finding has emerged following earlier observations of interstellar visitors 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov.</p>

<p>This discovery could significantly impact theories regarding the prevalence of such objects in our solar system. As researchers continue to study 3I/ATLAS, they aim to better understand its characteristics and the implications for the detection of similar bodies in the galaxy.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS may measure about 1 kilometre in diameter.</li>
    <li>Observations were made using the Allen Telescope Array for 7.25 hours on 2 July 2025.</li>
    <li>The object generated nearly 74 million narrowband hits, with only 211 matching its location.</li>
    <li>The isotopic radiated power of 3I/ATLAS has been estimated between 10 and 110 watts.</li>
    <li>No observable artificial impulses have been detected, indicating it is likely a natural object.</li>
    <li>The James Webb Space Telescope is expected to provide further insights into the object.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 2 July 2025, the Allen Telescope Array conducted radio observations of 3I/ATLAS. Researchers filtered through nearly 74 million hits, narrowing down to 211 signals that matched the object's location. Subsequent analysis determined that the isotopic radiated power of the object fell between 10 and 110 watts, based on its Doppler drift.</p>

<p>Following this, the Green Bank Telescope provided additional data, refining the estimated transmission power to 0.1 watts. These findings suggest that 3I/ATLAS does not emit artificial signals, supporting the idea that it is a natural celestial body.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist, stated, "If confirmed, the finding carries major implications for how many such objects may be passing unseen through our solar system."</blockquote>

<blockquote>Loeb also noted, "This estimate confirms my earlier estimate; however, several uncertainties remain."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS adds to the growing body of knowledge regarding interstellar objects. Prior incidents, such as the detection of 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have already challenged existing theories about the size and detectability of such bodies. The exploration of 3I/ATLAS highlights the need for a multifaceted approach to studying these visitors, combining various observational techniques.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS, with the James Webb Space Telescope expected to contribute valuable data in the future. Ongoing analysis aims to address the unanswered questions about the object's behaviour and characteristics.</p>
