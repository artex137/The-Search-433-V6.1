      <h2>Periodic light variability in interstellar object 3I/ATLAS linked to jet activity</h2>

<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, first detected on July 1, 2025, has exhibited periodic light variations with a cycle of 16.16 hours, according to observations reported by Harvard Professor Avi Loeb. The variability has an amplitude measured in tens of percent and has been attributed to jet activity surrounding the object rather than the shape of its nucleus.</p>

<p>This finding is significant for understanding the behavior of interstellar objects and their potential classification as natural comets or technological artifacts. Observations from the Hubble Space Telescope on July 21, 2025, revealed that most light observed originates from a coma surrounding the nucleus, indicating that the dynamics of 3I/ATLAS may provide insights into its composition and activity.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Detection date: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Light variation cycle: 16.16 hours</li>
    <li>Amplitude of variation: Tens of percent</li>
    <li>Imaging date: July 21, 2025</li>
    <li>Estimated effective radius of nucleus: 10 kilometers in visible light</li>
    <li>Upper limit of nucleus radius: Approximately 2.8 kilometers</li>
    <li>Outflow velocity of jets: 440 meters per second</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2025. Subsequent observations indicated periodic light variability associated with jet activity. On July 21, 2025, the Hubble Space Telescope provided imaging data that clarified the source of the light variations.</p>
<p>Initial analyses suggested that the variability was linked to the shape of the nucleus, but this was later contradicted by observational data, which indicated that the majority of light comes from the coma surrounding the nucleus.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The observed periodicity is attributed to collimated jets extending far beyond the nucleus, rather than the nucleus’s ellipsoidal shape,” said Avi Loeb. 
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior studies of comets have shown that periodic jets can form when localized ice pockets on the nucleus are exposed to the Sun. This is the first time such behavior has been observed in an interstellar object like 3I/ATLAS, which raises questions about its classification as either a natural comet or a technological object.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further analysis of Hubble imaging data, combined with ground-based observations and measurements from the Webb Telescope, is expected to continue. Researchers will evaluate the jet activity and monitor the periodic brightening patterns to enhance understanding of 3I/ATLAS.</p>
