      <h2>Obama explains ‘aliens are real’ remarks after Area 51 disclosure</h2>

<p>Former President Barack Obama has clarified his comments regarding extraterrestrial life during an appearance on the No Lie podcast with Brian Tyler Cohen on Sunday. Obama stated, “They’re real,” but added that he has not personally seen any aliens. He addressed the long-standing conspiracy theories surrounding Area 51, the classified U.S. Air Force facility in Nevada, asserting that no aliens are being kept there.</p>

<p>Obama's remarks have sparked significant public interest, particularly regarding the government's transparency about UFOs and aliens. In response to the attention his comments garnered, he sought to clarify his stance on the matter, emphasizing that while the universe is vast, the chances of extraterrestrial visitation are low.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Obama made his comments during an interview on the No Lie podcast on Sunday.</li>
    <li>He stated, "They’re real," when asked about aliens but noted he has not encountered them.</li>
    <li>Area 51, established in 1955, has been a focal point for conspiracy theories about UFOs.</li>
    <li>The CIA officially acknowledged Area 51's existence in August 2013.</li>
    <li>Obama was the first U.S. president to publicly mention Area 51 during a 2013 event.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In August 2013, the CIA confirmed the existence of Area 51 due to declassified documents. In December of the same year, Obama became the first sitting president to publicly mention the facility. Recently, on Sunday, he appeared on the No Lie podcast, where he discussed extraterrestrial life and Area 51.</p>

<p>Following the podcast, Obama took to Instagram to clarify his comments, stating that while the vastness of the universe suggests the possibility of life beyond Earth, the likelihood of contact with aliens is minimal.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Statistically, the universe is so vast that the odds are good there's life out there. But the distances between solar systems are so great that the chances we've been visited by aliens are low,” Obama wrote on Instagram.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. Really,” he added during the podcast.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Area 51 has long been associated with conspiracy theories regarding UFOs and alien life. The facility's activities have remained largely secretive since its establishment amid Cold War tensions. The acknowledgment of its existence by the CIA marked a significant moment in the public's understanding of the site.</p>

<p>Obama's comments represent a notable shift in the conversation around UFOs, as he is among the few former U.S. presidents to openly discuss the possibility of extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>There are no current investigations or charges related to the discussion of UFOs or aliens. However, public interest in the topic may lead to further inquiries into government transparency regarding extraterrestrial life and UFO sightings.</p>
