      <h2>Metallic black UFO with plasma: US military veterans reveal 'chilling' encounters during live hearing</h2>

<p>US military veterans have reported encounters with unidentified flying objects (UFOs) during a House task force hearing on Wednesday, October 18, 2023, titled “Restoring Public Trust Through UAP Transparency and Whistleblower Protection.” The testimonies included descriptions of strange aerial phenomena that defy conventional explanations.</p>

<p>This hearing is significant as it reflects growing governmental interest in unexplained aerial phenomena (UAP) and aims to provide a platform for witnesses to share their experiences without fear of repercussions. Lawmakers, including Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, are considering legal protections for witnesses to encourage more disclosures about UAPs.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Date: October 18, 2023</li>
<li>Location: US House of Representatives</li>
<li>Key witnesses: Air Force veteran Dylan Borland and Navy Senior Chief Petty Officer Alexandro Wiggins</li>
<li>Reported craft size: Approximately 100 feet</li>
<li>Primary testimony focus: UAPs and experiences of military personnel</li>
<li>NASA's position: No credible evidence of extraterrestrial life</li>
<li>Pentagon's statement: No evidence of off-world technology</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>At approximately 1:30 a.m. in 2012, Air Force veteran Dylan Borland reported observing a large triangular craft at Langley Air Force Base. He described the craft as having a black metallic exterior and emitting a gold plasma. The craft reportedly ascended rapidly to high altitudes.</p>

<p>During the hearing, Borland recounted facing “sustained reprisals” for over a decade after his initial disclosure about the encounter. He stated that he encountered significant challenges in his career due to blacklisting and intelligence probes.</p>

<p>Navy Senior Chief Petty Officer Alexandro Wiggins and other witnesses also shared experiences of seeing phenomena inconsistent with known aircraft or drones, further emphasizing the need for transparency and protection for those who come forward.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“This craft interfered with my telephone, did not have any sound, and the material it was made of appeared fluid or dynamic.”</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The hearing is part of ongoing discussions about UAPs and the need for transparency in military encounters with unidentified phenomena. Previous incidents have raised questions about national security and the nature of these encounters, prompting calls for greater accountability and protection for military personnel who report sightings.</p>

<p>Despite the testimonies, both NASA and the Pentagon have maintained that there is no credible evidence supporting claims of extraterrestrial technology or life.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Lawmakers are expected to continue discussions on legal protections for witnesses and further investigate the reported encounters with UAPs. The outcome of these discussions may influence future policies regarding military disclosures and transparency.
