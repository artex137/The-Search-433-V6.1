      <h2>Scientist warns of 'black swan event' as mystery 'alien spaceship' to reach Earth tomorrow</h2>

<p>A scientist has warned that an interstellar comet, 3I/ATLAS, is approaching Earth and will reach its closest point to the Sun on 30 October 2023. The comet, which is roughly the size of New York, has sparked concerns and speculation due to its unknown origins and potential implications for life beyond Earth. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with the comet.</p>

<p>This event has garnered attention from the scientific community and the public alike. Authorities are monitoring 3I/ATLAS closely as it approaches, with researchers from NASA and the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) working to gather more data. The comet's trajectory and characteristics have led some experts to suggest that it may not be a naturally formed object.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS detected by NASA on 1 July 2023</li>
    <li>Expected closest approach to the Sun on 30 October 2023</li>
    <li>Size comparable to that of New York City</li>
    <li>First observed interstellar object was 'Oumuamua in 2017</li>
    <li>Next observation of 3I/ATLAS expected on 2 November 2023</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected by NASA on 1 July 2023. Since its discovery, researchers have speculated about its origins and characteristics. Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has suggested that there is a 30 to 40 percent chance the comet is not a naturally formed object. The comet is currently behind the Sun and too bright for current telescopes to observe, with the next opportunity for observation set for 2 November when the European Space Agency’s JUICE spacecraft will examine it.</p>

<p>As the comet approaches its perihelion on 30 October, experts are considering the implications of its trajectory and potential interactions with Earth. Loeb has indicated that this date could be significant due to the Oberth effect, a phenomenon that could influence the comet's behaviour as it speeds up near the Sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "The hypothesis in question is that [3I/ATLAS] is a technological artefact, and furthermore has active intelligence. If this is the case, then two possibilities follow. First, that its intentions are entirely benign and second, they are malign." 
    <br>— Avi Loeb, Harvard astrophysicist
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object to enter our solar system, following 'Oumuamua in 2017 and another unidentified object in 2019. While 'Oumuamua generated significant debate regarding its nature, scientific consensus has since maintained that it was a natural object. Current observations of 3I/ATLAS are complicated by its position behind the Sun, limiting the ability of astronomers to gather data.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches perihelion. The next significant observation will occur on 2 November 2023, when the JUICE spacecraft will attempt to study the comet as it travels toward Jupiter. Authorities will assess the comet's behaviour and any potential implications for Earth as more data becomes available.</p>
