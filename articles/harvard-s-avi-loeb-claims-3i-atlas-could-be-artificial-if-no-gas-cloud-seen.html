      <h2>Harvard's Avi Loeb Claims 3I/ATLAS Could Be 'Artificial' If No Gas Cloud Seen</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has suggested that the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, discovered in Rio Hurtado, Chile, on 1 July 2025, could be artificial if it fails to show a detectable gas cloud. This claim raises questions about the nature of the comet, which is the third confirmed object to enter our solar system from beyond.</p>

<p>This assertion matters as it challenges existing scientific explanations of cometary behaviour. Loeb argues that if 3I/ATLAS does not exhibit a typical comet tail, scientists may need to consider the possibility of observing alien technology. The comet's unusual characteristics have drawn significant attention from astronomers worldwide.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovery date:</strong> 1 July 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Location of discovery:</strong> Rio Hurtado, Chile</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to the Sun (perihelion):</strong> 29 October 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Up to 244,600 km/h</li>
    <li><strong>Estimated size:</strong> 0.44 to 5.6 km across</li>
    <li><strong>Mass:</strong> At least 33 billion tons</li>
    <li><strong>Non-gravitational acceleration:</strong> 0.02 mm/s² over 50 days</li>
    <li><strong>Observing agencies:</strong> ALMA, NASA's JPL, Nordic Optical Telescope</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified by the ATLAS survey team on 1 July 2025 in Chile. It was later confirmed as the third interstellar object to pass through our solar system. The comet's perihelion occurred on 29 October 2025, where it approached the Sun at approximately 1.36 astronomical units (AU) away. Observations revealed that the comet exhibited non-gravitational acceleration, deviating from its predicted path.</p>

<p>Following its closest approach, astronomers noted a significant lack of a visible coma or typical comet tail, which raised questions about its composition and behaviour. It displayed a change in colour from reddish to deep blue, unusual for comets, further complicating its classification.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "The surface area required to account for the mass flow in the large-scale jets...is untenable. Given the solar power per unit area, the jets require an object larger than Manhattan Island."</blockquote>

<blockquote>Loeb added, "A large surface area can be provided by breaking up the object [into] many fragments. But this does not appear to be the case from the latest image obtained."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS follows in the wake of two earlier confirmed interstellar visitors: 1I/'Oumuamua, which displayed no visible cloud, and 2I/Borisov, which behaved like a standard comet by releasing gas. The characteristics of 3I/ATLAS, such as its size, speed, and lack of typical comet features, have prompted scientists to reconsider existing models of comet behaviour.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Avi Loeb and other researchers will continue to study 3I/ATLAS to gather more data on its composition and behaviour. Future observations may provide further insights into whether the object is a natural comet or something more unusual.</p>
