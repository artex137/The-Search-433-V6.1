      <h2>The truth about UFOs and Bigfoot, as we enter a new ‘dark age’ of misinformation</h2>

<p>Australia’s leading magazine of critical thought, The Skeptic, has ceased publication after 44 years, raising concerns over the increase of misinformation regarding topics such as UFOs and Bigfoot. The final edition was released a few months ago, but no specific date was disclosed.</p>

<p>This closure highlights a shift in society’s approach to skepticism and misinformation. Tim Mendham, editor in chief of The Skeptic, expressed concern that we may be entering a less skeptical age, where misinformation proliferates unchecked. He noted that while misinformation has always existed, its impact has become more harmful with the rise of social media and influencers.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The Skeptic magazine ended its print run after 44 years.</li>
    <li>Founded by the Australian Skeptics in 1981, the magazine aimed to debunk misinformation.</li>
    <li>Tim Mendham has served as editor in chief throughout its publication.</li>
    <li>Concerns over misinformation have been raised by experts like Jeremy Brownlie, an associate professor at Griffith University.</li>
    <li>Brownlie’s reports on misinformation are currently under consideration by the federal government.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 1981, The Skeptic was launched by the Australian Skeptics to combat misinformation in Australia. Over the years, it has published numerous investigations into paranormal claims, including debunking psychic surgery and water divining.</p>
<p>In recent months, the magazine announced the end of its print publication, prompting discussions about the state of skepticism in society. Experts like Tim Mendham and Jeremy Brownlie have voiced concerns about the rise of misinformation and its implications for public trust.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“As a sceptic, you’re supposed to give people a fair go,” Tim Mendham said. “At times you feel like saying, ‘You’re a f---ing idiot.’”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Misinformation hacks that architecture of our brain and the way we think,” Jeremy Brownlie stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Throughout its history, The Skeptic magazine has tackled various pseudoscientific claims, including investigations into the Loch Ness Monster and Bigfoot. The magazine’s inaugural issue featured an article on “psychic surgery,” which claimed to utilize invisible tools to treat patients. These investigations have contributed to Australia’s reputation as a leader in debunking false claims.</p>
<p>Recent trends indicate a decline in public trust toward institutions, which has been linked to the rise of misinformation. Brownlie noted that this trend is evident in various advanced economies, including the United States, where trust in government and institutions has reached historical lows.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Moving forward, experts like Brownlie advocate for improved critical thinking skills and scientific literacy in education. The Skeptic will continue as an online publication, with Mendham emphasizing the ongoing need for skepticism in the face of rising misinformation.</p>
