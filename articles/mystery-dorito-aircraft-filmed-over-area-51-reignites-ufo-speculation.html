      <h2>Mystery ‘Dorito’ aircraft filmed over Area 51 reignites UFO speculation</h2>

<p>A backpacker has filmed a possible unidentified flying object (UFO) near Area 51, reviving speculation about a “Dorito”-shaped craft linked to sightings over the past decade. The footage was captured by Anders Otteson during an overnight camping trip on January 14, 2026, near the classified US Air Force site in southern Nevada. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This sighting has drawn attention to ongoing debates regarding military aircraft and UFOs. Authorities have not provided definitive explanations for past sightings, and the ongoing secrecy surrounding the Nevada Test and Training Range complicates efforts to identify the object filmed by Otteson.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Filming occurred on January 14, 2026, around 1am and 3am.</li>
    <li>Location: Near Area 51, southern Nevada.</li>
    <li>Videographer: Anders Otteson.</li>
    <li>Previous sightings linked to Jeff Templin (2014, Wichita) and Steve Douglass (2014, Amarillo).</li>
    <li>US Air Force spokesperson: Jennifer Cassidy.</li>
    <li>FAA spokesperson: Alison Duquette.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On January 14, 2026, at approximately 1am, Anders Otteson reported hearing jet engines while camping near Area 51. He initially suspected a B-2 Spirit stealth bomber had flown overhead. By around 3am, he recorded a second flyover that he described as having a “Dorito” shape, resembling an equilateral triangle with a flatter trailing edge.</p>

<p>Otteson later shared the footage on YouTube, sparking renewed interest in similar unidentified sightings from 2014. Those earlier incidents involved triangular aircraft that remained unexplained, leading to speculation regarding their nature.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It’s hard to say conclusively what we’re looking at,” Otteson said. “In relation to recent Dorito sightings in Death Valley and those from 2014, I think we have something interesting here. Are we seeing a classified test flight or routine training?”</blockquote>

<blockquote>Jennifer Cassidy, a spokesperson for the US Air Force, noted the poor quality of the footage made it impossible to determine if the aircraft was military. “We cannot definitively identify it,” she stated.</blockquote>

<blockquote>FAA spokesperson Alison Duquette simply replied: “I do not know.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The “Dorito” aircraft has been a topic of interest since sightings began more than a decade ago. Speculation has included comparisons to the cancelled A-12 Avenger II carrier-based bomber concept. However, previous investigations into such sightings have yielded mixed results, with no conclusive evidence provided to support claims of military involvement.</p>

<p>The ongoing secrecy of the Nevada Test and Training Range has contributed to the enduring legend of the “flying Dorito,” as many attempts to identify these aircraft remain inconclusive.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the recent sighting may continue, but definitive answers regarding the object filmed by Otteson are unlikely due to the classified nature of the area. The debate surrounding the “flying Dorito” is expected to persist as more footage and reports emerge.</p>
