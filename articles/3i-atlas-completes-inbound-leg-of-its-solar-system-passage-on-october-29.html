      <h2>3I/ATLAS completes inbound leg of its Solar System passage on October 29</h2>

<p>Interstellar object 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1 ATLAS) has reached its perihelion distance of approximately 1.36 AU from the Sun at about 11:47 UTC on October 29, 2025, while located between the orbits of Earth and Mars. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with this astronomical event.</p>

<p>This perihelion marks a significant milestone in the comet's one-time passage through the Solar System. After this point, 3I/ATLAS will continue on its hyperbolic trajectory, passing within 97 million km (60 million miles) of Venus and 54 million km (34 million miles) of Jupiter. Researchers are now preparing to observe the comet again after it emerges from solar conjunction in late November 2025.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Perihelion reached at approximately 11:47 UTC on October 29, 2025.</li>
    <li>Location at perihelion: about 1.356 AU (203 million km or 126 million miles) from the Sun.</li>
    <li>Object discovered on July 1, 2025, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS).</li>
    <li>Expected closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, at about 267 million km (166 million miles).</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Jupiter on March 16, 2026, at about 54 million km (34 million miles).</li>
    <li>Solar irradiance at perihelion reached approximately 770 watts/m².</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS program. Following its discovery, the comet's rapid motion indicated its interstellar nature. On October 29, 2025, it reached perihelion at approximately 11:47 UTC, entering solar conjunction and becoming unobservable from Earth.</p>

<p>After perihelion, it will begin its outbound journey through the Solar System. On November 3, 2025, it will pass within about 97 million km (60 million miles) of Venus. The comet is expected to have its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The perihelion event is a rare observational window to study an interstellar object under intense solar conditions,” said Avi Loeb, an astrophysicist who referred to this moment as the acid test for understanding the object’s true nature.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar visitor to the Solar System, following 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Unlike these predecessors, 3I/ATLAS is active, exhibiting a diffuse coma and dust tail, as observed through optical and spectroscopic studies.</p>

<p>Previous interstellar objects have shown varied behavior; for instance, 2I/Borisov displayed strong outgassing, while 1I/ʻOumuamua remained inert. The differences in behavior among these objects continue to intrigue researchers.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>After re-emerging from solar conjunction in late November 2025, observatories will resume imaging and spectroscopy of 3I/ATLAS. Researchers aim to determine if the perihelion heating has altered the comet's structure or activity.</p>
