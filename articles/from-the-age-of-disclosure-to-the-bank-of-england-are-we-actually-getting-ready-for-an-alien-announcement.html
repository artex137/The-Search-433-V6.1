      <h2>Former Bank of England Analyst Urges UFO Disclosure Preparation</h2>

<p>A former analyst at the Bank of England has called for the central bank to prepare for potential financial turmoil linked to the announcement of extraterrestrial life. Helen McCaw has written to Governor Andrew Bailey, highlighting the need for the bank to consider a sudden disclosure by the White House as a stress scenario for markets. Her letter, reported by The Times, reflects growing concerns about how such an announcement could impact public trust and financial stability.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as it connects to broader discussions about unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) and their implications for society. McCaw's warning suggests that an official confirmation of non-human intelligence could lead to market volatility, bank failures, and civil unrest. She argues that regulators should model potential fallout scenarios to prevent panic and manage public response effectively.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Helen McCaw is a former senior analyst in financial stability at the Bank of England.</li>
    <li>She has urged the Bank of England to treat potential “alien disclosure” as a stress scenario for markets.</li>
    <li>The letter was addressed to Governor Andrew Bailey, though the date of the correspondence is not disclosed.</li>
    <li>McCaw's concerns stem from a detailed white paper she wrote for the Sol Foundation in 2024.</li>
    <li>The documentary "The Age of Disclosure" premiered at SXSW in March 2025 and became the highest-grossing documentary on Amazon Prime Video in November 2025.</li>
    <li>The film features insights from 34 current and former U.S. government, military, and intelligence officials.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In March 2025, "The Age of Disclosure," directed by Dan Farah, premiered at the SXSW Film & TV Festival. The documentary claims there has been an 80-year cover-up regarding non-human intelligent life.</p>
<p>In November 2025, the film was released in theaters and on Amazon Prime Video, where it achieved significant viewership and financial success.</p>
<p>In 2024, Helen McCaw wrote a white paper for the Sol Foundation discussing policy implications related to UAP, which has influenced her recent letter to the Bank of England.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“If a president steps to a podium and drops that bombshell, it could trigger serious market volatility.” - Helen McCaw, in her letter to the Bank of England.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Regulators cannot model the probability of contact, but they can and should plan for the fallout if it happens.” - Helen McCaw, addressing the need for institutional preparation.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The conversation about UAP has gained traction since 2017, when the U.S. government established new UAP offices and acknowledged unexplained objects in restricted airspace. This evolving narrative has provided a cultural context for discussions surrounding potential disclosure.</p>
<p>Critics of "The Age of Disclosure" have pointed out that while the film presents compelling testimonies from insiders, it lacks new physical evidence to substantiate claims of extraterrestrial encounters. This divide in perspectives reflects ongoing debates about the implications of UAP disclosures.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Regulators and financial institutions are likely to continue exploring the implications of potential UFO disclosures, with a focus on managing public perception and market stability. Further discussions may arise as new information about UAP becomes available.</p>
