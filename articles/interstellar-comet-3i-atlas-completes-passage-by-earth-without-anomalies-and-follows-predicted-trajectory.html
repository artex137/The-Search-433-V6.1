      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS completes passage by Earth without anomalies</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has completed its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, following a stable trajectory that aligned with all scientific predictions, according to NASA. The global astronomical community has confirmed that the comet passed at a safe distance of approximately 270 million kilometers, posing no risk to the planet.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it marks the third confirmed visitor from outside our solar system. The data collected during its passage is expected to enhance understanding of the formation and composition of other star systems. Authorities have implemented extensive monitoring to gather detailed information about the comet's chemical composition and orbital dynamics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Closest approach date: December 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth: Approximately 270 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Comet speed: Exceeding 58 km/s</li>
    <li>First detected: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Observation instruments: Hubble Space Telescope, Very Large Telescope (VLT)</li>
    <li>Estimated nucleus diameter: Between 1 and 3 kilometers</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2025, using the ATLAS astronomical survey system. Initial observations indicated a sharp hyperbolic trajectory, confirming its interstellar origin.</p>

<p>In the lead-up to its closest approach, a coordinated observation campaign was conducted globally, involving powerful telescopes to gather high-resolution images and data. The comet reached its closest point to Earth on December 19, 2025, after which ongoing analysis continued.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The stability of 3I/ATLAS validates the mathematical models used to track interstellar objects,” a NASA spokesperson said. “This improves our ability to anticipate and analyze future cosmic visitors.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object confirmed to have visited our solar system, following ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Its passage provides valuable data that contrasts with the behavior of other interstellar bodies, particularly regarding their trajectories and stability.</p>

<p>The Breakthrough Listen project, which was involved in the observation, conducted a search for “technosignatures” during the comet's approach. This involved scanning for narrowband signals that could indicate artificial transmissions.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Ongoing analyses will continue to provide insights into the comet's composition and behavior. Researchers will compare this data with other interstellar objects to enhance understanding of their origins and the conditions in which they formed.</p>
