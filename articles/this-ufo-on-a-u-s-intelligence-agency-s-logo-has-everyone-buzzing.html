      <h2>This UFO on a U.S. Intelligence Agency’s Logo Has Everyone Buzzing</h2>

<p>The National Intelligence Manager for Aviation (NIM-A) has removed a logo featuring a UFO from its website, which was briefly posted on September 25, 2023. The logo included a flying saucer alongside a Russian fighter jet and a Turkish drone. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this incident.</p>

<p>This logo has drawn significant attention due to its unusual inclusion of a UFO, raising questions about the agency's stance on unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP). NIM-A, which advises U.S. intelligence on aviation threats, has been involved in drafting reports concerning UFOs, highlighting the government's increasing focus on aerial phenomena.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>NIM-A posted the logo on September 25, 2023, at 5:51 a.m. ET.</li>
    <li>The logo was removed between 2:02 a.m. and 4:14 a.m. ET on September 27, 2023.</li>
    <li>The logo featured a UFO, a Russian Sukhoi Su-57 fighter jet, and a Bayraktar TB-2 drone.</li>
    <li>NIM-A is responsible for identifying and analyzing aviation threats.</li>
    <li>No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with the logo.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On September 25, 2023, NIM-A posted a new logo on its website that included a UFO alongside various aircraft. The logo went viral on social media shortly after its appearance. By September 27, the logo had been removed from the site, following widespread attention and criticism.</p>

<p>The logo's presence on the website was documented by the Internet Archive Wayback Machine, which confirmed its existence as early as 5:51 a.m. ET. The agency has not disclosed how long the logo was intended to be displayed.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>The Office of the Director of National Intelligence stated, “NIM Aviation erroneously posted an unofficial and incorrect logo.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The inclusion of a UFO in a government agency's logo is unusual and has raised eyebrows given the Pentagon's recent focus on UAPs. The U.S. military has reported numerous encounters with unidentified aerial phenomena over the past 12 years, prompting discussions about the nature of these sightings and their implications for national security.</p>

<p>NIM-A has previously contributed to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence’s report on UAPs, indicating its active role in addressing these phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NIM-A has reverted to using its previous logo while the agency assesses the incident. There are no current investigations or further actions disclosed related to the logo's posting.</p>
