      <h2>Anna Paulina Luna wants answers on comet and ‘interstellar visitors’ to solar system</h2>

<p>U.S. Representative <strong>Anna Paulina Luna</strong> has called for more information regarding comet <strong>3I/ATLAS</strong>, which passed approximately 130 million miles from Earth over the weekend. Luna sent a letter to acting NASA Administrator <strong>Sean Duffy</strong> on October 31, urging the release of data and imagery related to the comet, which may hold crucial insights into potential extraterrestrial life.</p>

<p>This inquiry follows significant interest in the comet, particularly after the <strong>Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter</strong> detected possible ice in the comet's nucleus. Luna emphasized the importance of the findings in her letter, stating that they could enhance understanding of interstellar visitors and their interactions with our solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS passed within 130 million miles of Earth over the weekend.</li>
    <li>Luna sent her letter to NASA on October 31.</li>
    <li>The comet may contain ice and is primarily composed of nickel.</li>
    <li>This is the third interstellar comet observed in the solar system.</li>
    <li>NASA scientists are currently studying the comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In late October 2023, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter reported signs of ice on comet 3I/ATLAS. Following this discovery, Anna Paulina Luna sent a letter to NASA on October 31, requesting further data and observations of the comet. The comet passed near Earth over the weekend, generating increased interest in its composition and potential implications for extraterrestrial life.</p>

<p>On November 3, Sean Duffy responded to inquiries, including one from reality star <strong>Kim Kardashian</strong>, stating that the comet does not indicate an alien presence or a threat to life on Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “This information is of great importance to advancing our understanding of interstellar visitors and their interaction with our solar system,” Luna wrote in her letter to Duffy.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “NASA’s observations show that this is the third interstellar comet to pass through our solar system. No aliens. No threat to life here on Earth,” Duffy stated in his response on social media.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “We should not hold science hostage to the shutdown politics of the day,” said Harvard professor <strong>Avi Loeb</strong>, who praised Luna's inquiry and emphasized the need for timely data dissemination.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The interest in comet 3I/ATLAS reflects a growing trend in scientific inquiry into interstellar objects. Past events have seen similar speculation about alien life, particularly with objects originating outside the solar system. The current U.S. government shutdown has raised concerns about delays in scientific research and data release.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA is expected to continue studying comet 3I/ATLAS, although the timeline for additional data release remains uncertain due to the ongoing government shutdown. Luna’s call for further observations may prompt additional discussions regarding funding and resources for space research.</p>
