      <h2>The Day has come — 3I/ATLAS "brushes past" the Earth and it's possible it will never come back</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has brushed past Earth today, December 19, 2025, coming within approximately 1.8 astronomical units, or 270 million kilometers. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to the event.</p>

<p>The appearance of 3I/ATLAS is significant as it marks only the third comet ever observed on a hyperbolic trajectory. Scientists have noted that this is a rare opportunity to study the comet before it continues into interstellar space and is unlikely to return. Astronomers have set up equipment worldwide to capture images and data during this fleeting encounter.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS has passed Earth at a distance of approximately 1.8 astronomical units, or 270 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>The comet was first identified in mid-2025.</li>
    <li>This is the third comet observed on a hyperbolic trajectory.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS has exhibited increased activity since its approach to the sun in October 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet’s coma emits a green glow due to diatomic carbon and other carbon-based gases.</li>
    <li>The comet showcases brightness changes approximately every 16.16 hours.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Mid-2025: Comet 3I/ATLAS is first identified.</p>
<p>October 2025: The comet shows increased activity as it approaches the sun.</p>
<p>December 19, 2025: Comet 3I/ATLAS brushes past Earth, providing a rare observation opportunity for astronomers.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This brush past Earth offers a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for scientists to study the comet closely,” said an astronomer involved in the observations.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I/ATLAS, only two other comets had been observed on hyperbolic trajectories, making this event particularly notable for the scientific community. The comet’s unique characteristics allow for comparisons with other planetary systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues on its path into interstellar space, scientists will analyze the data collected during its approach to better understand its composition and behavior. Further observations of other celestial bodies are also planned, including an unidentified asteroid being tracked by NASA.</p>
