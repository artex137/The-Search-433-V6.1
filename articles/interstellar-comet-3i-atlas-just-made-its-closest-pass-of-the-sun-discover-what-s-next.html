      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS just made its closest pass of the sun. Discover what’s next</h2>

<p>An interstellar comet, 3I/ATLAS, has made its closest approach to the sun, coming within about 126 million miles (203 million kilometers) of the star on October 30, 2025. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this astronomical event.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it allows astronomers to study the comet's composition and its origins outside our solar system. Darryl Seligman, an assistant professor at Michigan State University, indicated that the comet is currently behind the sun from the perspective of Earth but should be visible to stargazers starting November 11. The European Space Agency (ESA) has confirmed that the comet poses no threat to Earth, with its closest approach occurring on December 19, when it will come within about 168 million miles (270 million kilometers) of our planet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS approached the sun on October 30, 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest distance to the sun: 126 million miles (203 million kilometers).</li>
    <li>Expected visibility for observers: November 11, 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2025, at 168 million miles (270 million kilometers).</li>
    <li>Comet's estimated age: 3 billion to 11 billion years.</li>
    <li>Previous closest approach to Mars: October 3, 2025, at 18.6 million miles (30 million kilometers).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, and has been observed by astronomers since then. On October 3, it made its closest approach to Mars, coming within 18.6 million miles (30 million kilometers) of the planet. The comet passed closest to the sun on October 30, 2025, and is set to be visible again starting November 11. Its closest approach to Earth will occur on December 19, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “When it gets closest to the sun, you get the most holistic view of the nucleus possible,” said Darryl Seligman. “One of the main things driving most cometary scientists is, what is the composition of the volatiles?”
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “This was a very challenging observation for the instrument,” noted Nick Thomas, principal investigator of the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter's camera, regarding the comet's observation in October.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third known interstellar object to pass through our solar system, providing valuable insights into the materials that make up such comets. Comets are often described as "dirty snowballs," consisting of ice, dust, and rock, and their behavior near stars can reveal their composition and origins.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to observe 3I/ATLAS over the coming months, utilizing powerful telescopes and space missions to gather more data before the comet leaves our solar system. Observations from missions like ESA’s Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer are expected, although data from these observations may not be available until February 2026.</p>
