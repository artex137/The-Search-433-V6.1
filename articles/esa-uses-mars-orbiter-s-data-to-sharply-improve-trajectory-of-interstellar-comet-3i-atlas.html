      <h2>ESA uses Mars orbiter’s data to sharply improve trajectory of Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>The European Space Agency (ESA) has significantly improved the trajectory predictions for comet 3I/ATLAS, which was discovered on 1 July 2025, by using data from the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) that orbits Mars. The ESA announced this development following observations made between 1 and 7 October 2025, when the comet was approximately 29 million kilometers from Mars.</p>

<p>This advancement is important because it enhances the precision of tracking fast-moving interstellar objects like 3I/ATLAS. Although the comet does not threaten Earth, the successful integration of space-based and terrestrial observations demonstrates a method that could improve trajectory predictions for future space objects. ESA's Near-Earth Object Coordination Centre has incorporated the new data into its trajectory calculations.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered on 1 July 2025.</li>
    <li>Improved trajectory predictions by a factor of ten using TGO data.</li>
    <li>Comet passed approximately 29 million kilometers from Mars on 3 October 2025.</li>
    <li>Comet travels at speeds up to 250,000 kilometers per hour.</li>
    <li>First astrometric measurements from a spacecraft orbiting another planet accepted into the Minor Planet Center database.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 1 July 2025, comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered. Until September 2025, predictions for its trajectory relied solely on Earth-based telescopes. Between 1 and 7 October 2025, ESA's ExoMars TGO observed the comet as it approached Mars. The observations allowed for a tenfold increase in trajectory accuracy compared to previous estimates.</p>

<p>The TGO's CaSSIS instrument, typically used for imaging Mars, was repurposed to track the comet against a background of stars. This collaboration involved various teams who integrated the spacecraft data into the trajectory calculations. The results were submitted to the Minor Planet Center, marking a significant milestone in interplanetary observation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Triangulating data from different locations in space can improve the accuracy of orbit predictions for near-Earth objects,” ESA reported.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“These observations represent the first time astrometric measurements from a spacecraft orbiting another planet have been officially submitted and accepted into the Minor Planet Center database,” according to Space Daily.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This exercise serves as a test case for planetary defence, demonstrating how data from multiple spacecraft can enhance tracking capabilities. Previously, observations of interstellar objects relied heavily on Earth-based telescopes, which limited the accuracy of trajectory predictions.</p>

<p>ESA is also preparing for future missions, including the Neomir mission to monitor regions obscured from Earth-based detection and the Comet Interceptor mission aimed at investigating a comet directly.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>ESA plans to continue monitoring 3I/ATLAS with the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (Juice) spacecraft, which will observe the comet following its closest approach to the Sun, with data expected by February 2026.</p>
