      <h2>First Limit on Technological Radio Transmission from 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>The MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa has conducted a search for narrowband radio transmission from the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS on November 5, 2025. According to the report, the telescope detected a total of 23,689 signals, but all were found to be inconsistent with the position of 3I/ATLAS, likely due to human-made radio frequency interference.</p>

<p>This observation marks the establishment of a detection limit of 0.17 Watts over a frequency range of 900 to 1670 megahertz, roughly equivalent to the power output of a mobile phone. The distance to 3I/ATLAS at the time was 334 million kilometers. NASA is set to hold a press conference today at 3 PM ET to publicly release new data from ground-based and space-based observations, including images of 3I/ATLAS taken when it came within 29 million kilometers of Mars on October 3, 2025.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of observation: November 5, 2025</li>
    <li>Location: MeerKAT radio telescope, South Africa</li>
    <li>Number of signals detected: 23,689</li>
    <li>Detection limit: 0.17 Watts</li>
    <li>Distance to 3I/ATLAS: 334 million kilometers</li>
    <li>NASA press conference time: 3 PM ET</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2025, at 269 million kilometers</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 3, 2025, 3I/ATLAS came within 29 million kilometers of Mars, allowing the HiRISE camera on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter to capture images with a pixel resolution of 30 kilometers. The MeerKAT telescope then conducted its observations on November 5, 2025, detecting a large number of signals, all of which were ruled out as potential technological signatures.</p>

<p>Following these observations, NASA is scheduled to hold a press conference today to discuss new findings about 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“So far, 3I/ATLAS did not display any unambiguous technological signatures, such as a major maneuver, artificial light or transmission of a radio signal,” said the report.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is being scrutinized due to its unusual characteristics, which have raised questions about its nature. It has displayed anomalies that could suggest a technological origin, including a trajectory aligned with the ecliptic plane and a gas plume composition unlike that of known comets.</p>

<p>The object is expected to approach Earth at a distance of 269 million kilometers on December 19, 2025, prompting ongoing evaluations about its potential implications.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA's press conference today will provide further insights into the observations of 3I/ATLAS and may clarify the nature of the signals detected. Future investigations will focus on analyzing the data collected during the close approach to Mars and the upcoming proximity to Earth.</p>
