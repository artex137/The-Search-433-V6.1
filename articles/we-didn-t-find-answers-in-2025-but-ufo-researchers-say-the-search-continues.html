      <h2>We didn't find answers in 2025, but UFO researchers say the search continues</h2>

<p>UFO researchers have reported ongoing challenges in understanding unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) in the United States as of 2025. Despite years of investigations and testimonies from whistleblowers, there has been little progress in resolving the mysteries surrounding UAP sightings, which continue to occur over sensitive areas and interfere with commercial air traffic.</p>

<p>The lack of clarity regarding UAP is prompting authorities and researchers to advocate for enhanced scientific methods and funding to further investigate these phenomena. Experts emphasize that a systematic approach is necessary to collect reliable data and develop theories about the origins of UAP.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>UAP sightings have been reported over sensitive facilities and commercial air traffic routes.</li>
    <li>Michael Cifone is the founding executive director of the Society for UAP Studies.</li>
    <li>The University of Würzburg has established an Interdisciplinary Research Center for Extraterrestrial Studies (IFEX).</li>
    <li>The Galileo Project, led by Avi Loeb of Harvard University, is developing sensors to monitor aerial phenomena.</li>
    <li>Robert Powell estimates that setting up a network to monitor UAP could cost tens to hundreds of millions of dollars.</li>
    <li>Ryan Graves is chair of the AIAA Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena Integration Committee.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In recent years, UAP have gained significant attention in the United States, with numerous reports emerging from military and civilian sources. Despite the ongoing investigations, experts have noted a bottleneck in progress as of 2025. Key researchers, including Michael Cifone and Robert Powell, have highlighted the need for better funding and institutional support to advance UAP studies.</p>

<p>The University of Würzburg has initiated research efforts to capture UAP through its IFEX center, while the Galileo Project continues to develop technology aimed at understanding these phenomena. The growing interest in UAP research has led to collaborations between academic institutions and aviation authorities.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Perhaps the holdup is reluctance to dump time, energy and money into what looks to some like a wild goose chase,” said Michael Cifone.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The military has the capability with radar, satellite, and optical systems, but the scientific community does not have access to these systems,” stated Robert Powell.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Highly credible people and professional observers are seeing objects that appear to exhibit capabilities beyond the state of the art,” said Ryan Graves.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The investigation of UAP is becoming a recognized field of study, with various institutions worldwide contributing to research efforts. The historical stigma associated with UAP has made securing funding and support difficult, but recent developments indicate a shift toward a more serious inquiry.</p>

<p>Many researchers believe that the scientific community must adopt rigorous methodologies to investigate UAP effectively. This includes the establishment of observational frameworks and data collection systems to analyze sightings comprehensively.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>UAP research is expected to continue, with calls for increased funding and resources to support scientific investigations. Experts like Cifone and Powell are advocating for a long-term commitment to studying UAP, emphasizing that advancements in understanding these phenomena will take time and require sustained effort.</p>
