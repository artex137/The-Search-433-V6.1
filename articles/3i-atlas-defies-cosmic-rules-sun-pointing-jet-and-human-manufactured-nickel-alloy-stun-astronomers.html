      <h2>3I/ATLAS defies cosmic rules? Sun-pointing jet and ‘human-manufactured’ nickel alloy stun Astronomers</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has puzzled astronomers since its discovery on July 1, with unusual behavior observed through various telescopes, including a detailed image captured by the Hubble Space Telescope on July 21. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This anomaly is significant as it challenges existing knowledge about comet behavior. Authorities, including researchers from Harvard and the Keck Observatory, are investigating the comet’s unique characteristics, which include a jet pointing toward the Sun and an unusual metal composition.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> July 1, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Hubble Image Capture:</strong> July 21, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Jet Length:</strong> 3.7 miles (approximately 6 km)</li>
    <li><strong>Nickel Emission:</strong> Four grams per second</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to Mars:</strong> Within 12 million miles (approximately 19 million km)</li>
    <li><strong>Images from Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter:</strong> Captured between October 4 and October 7, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Researcher:</strong> Dr. Avi Loeb, Harvard astrophysicist</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2023. Detailed imaging by the Hubble Space Telescope occurred on July 21, revealing unusual characteristics. In August, the Two-Meter Twin Telescope in the Canary Islands captured an image showing a jet extending toward the Sun. New findings from the Keck II Telescope confirmed the comet emits a plume of nickel, a composition not typically found in comets. The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter captured images of the comet between October 4 and October 7, 2023.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The existence of an anti-tail pointed toward the sun is an anomaly that raises two questions: What is the nature of the anti-tail? Why are comet experts ignoring this anomaly while insisting that 3I/ATLAS is a familiar comet?”</blockquote> 
<blockquote>“There is only one place where that is known to exist, and that is in industrially produced nickel alloys.”</blockquote> 
<blockquote>“This was a process that we can imagine only because it was used in industry. Never seen in comets before.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the latest interstellar comet to challenge existing scientific understanding. Previous interstellar visitors, including 2I/Borisov, displayed typical cometary characteristics, with nickel and iron present in comparable amounts. The current findings may prompt a reevaluation of comet formation theories.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers are awaiting the release of images from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. The delay in publication is reportedly linked to the ongoing U.S. government shutdown. These images are expected to provide detailed views of 3I/ATLAS during its passage through the inner Solar System.</p>
