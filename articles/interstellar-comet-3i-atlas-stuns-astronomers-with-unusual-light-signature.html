      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Stuns Astronomers With Unusual Light Signature</h2>

<p>A team of astronomers has discovered that interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS exhibits an unusual light signature, a finding reported in a preprint paper submitted to The Astrophysical Journal Letters on October 5, 2025. The comet's light behaves differently than any previously recorded comet, raising questions about its classification.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it may suggest that 3I/ATLAS belongs to a new class of interstellar bodies. Researchers are now studying its polarimetric behavior to better understand its composition and structure. The findings could reshape current knowledge about comets and similar celestial objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first spotted on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Its nucleus is estimated to be 5.6 kilometres wide and has a mass exceeding 33 billion tons.</li>
    <li>The comet travels at nearly twice the speed of earlier interstellar visitors.</li>
    <li>Polarimetric measurements show a minimum polarization of −2.77 ± 0.11%.</li>
    <li>The comet has a diffuse coma that formed as it neared the Sun.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS may not be visible again until later this year.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers first detected 3I/ATLAS as it entered the Solar System. The comet exhibited a green-tinged coma as it approached the Sun, indicating the presence of volatile materials. Shortly thereafter, the comet faded from view, potentially due to a coronal mass ejection. Researchers have since conducted polarimetric observations to analyze its light behavior.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This polarimetric behaviour is significantly different from all known comets (either interstellar or bound to our Solar System),” the research team stated in their paper.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“These findings may demonstrate that 3I represents a distinct type of comet, expanding the diversity of known interstellar bodies,” they concluded.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The study of interstellar comets has gained traction since the discovery of ‘Oumuamua in 2017 and Comet Borisov in 2019. These objects have challenged existing theories about the formation and characteristics of comets. The unusual properties of 3I/ATLAS add to the growing body of evidence suggesting that not all comets conform to established categories.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS and analyze its light signature. Further observations are expected when the comet becomes visible again later this year. The ongoing research may lead to a better understanding of its composition and classification within the broader context of interstellar objects.</p>
