      <h2>Reform UK announces expert on ghosts and UFOs as latest defection to party</h2>

<p>Reform UK has welcomed a new member, Rupert Matthews, a police and crime commissioner and expert on ghosts and UFOs, who has defected from the Conservative Party after 40 years. Matthews was introduced during a press conference at the party’s London headquarters on Monday.</p>

<p>This defection is significant as it highlights Reform UK's strategy to attract members with unconventional backgrounds, particularly those who challenge mainstream political narratives. Authorities have responded with skepticism, with a Labour spokesperson questioning the party's seriousness in addressing pressing issues.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Rupert Matthews has served as a police and crime commissioner in Leicestershire and Rutland since 2021.</li>
  <li>He previously held a position as a European parliament member for the Conservative Party for two years.</li>
  <li>Matthews has authored several books on paranormal subjects, including UFOs and cryptozoology.</li>
  <li>The announcement took place on Monday, not disclosed the exact time.</li>
  <li>Reform UK also announced the addition of Vanessa Frake-Harris, a retired prison governor.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On Monday, Reform UK introduced Rupert Matthews as their latest member, marking his departure from the Conservative Party after a 40-year affiliation. Matthews has a background in writing about paranormal topics and has been critical of the current political landscape.</p>

<p>During the press conference, Matthews criticized the criminal justice system and called for the removal of what he termed the “dark heart of wokeness.” He expressed concerns over rising crime rates and the perceived failures of both Conservative and Labour governments.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The self-serving, self-entitled liberal elite who have let our country down time after time after time are now on notice. Their day is almost done.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Successive governments, Conservative and Labour, have driven the prison service to its knees through lack of investment, support and an unwillingness to allow people who know what they are doing to get the job done.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This defection comes amid growing scrutiny of Reform UK’s policies and the party's attempts to differentiate itself from traditional political parties. Critics have raised concerns about the party's focus on unconventional issues and its ability to address practical challenges faced by the public.</p>

<p>Prior incidents involving controversial statements from party members have led to public mockery and skepticism regarding the party's overall platform and effectiveness.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Reform UK is expected to continue its recruitment efforts and develop its law and order task force, which will include input from new members like Vanessa Frake-Harris. Investigations into the party's policy proposals and their implications may also follow as public interest grows.</p>
