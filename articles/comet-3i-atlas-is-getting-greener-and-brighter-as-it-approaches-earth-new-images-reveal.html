      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS is getting greener and brighter as it approaches Earth, new images reveal</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has become brighter and greener as it approaches Earth, according to new images taken with the Gemini North telescope in Hawaii. The updated observations, captured on November 26, show the comet in an active phase following its close flyby of the sun in October.</p>

<p>This increase in brightness and change in color are significant as they suggest the comet may produce new outbursts of material. Authorities are closely monitoring 3I/ATLAS as it nears its closest approach to Earth on December 19, when it will come within 270 million kilometers (170 million miles) of our planet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was last observed on November 26, 2023.</li>
    <li>It will reach its closest point to Earth on December 19, 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet is moving at an estimated speed of 210,000 km/h (130,000 mph).</li>
    <li>The observations were conducted using the Gemini North telescope located on Mauna Kea, Hawaii.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object discovered, following 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was detected in late June 2023 as it entered the solar system. Initial observations showed it with a red hue, indicating a different composition. Following its close approach to the sun in late October, 3I/ATLAS has shown increased activity and brightness, particularly noted in the images taken in late November.</p>

<p>The comet's activity is attributed to solar radiation heating its icy surface, causing sublimation and the release of gases and dust.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>"What remains unknown is how the comet will behave as it leaves the Sun's vicinity and cools down," representatives from the National Science Foundation's NOIRLab stated. "Many comets have a delayed reaction in experiencing the Sun's heat due to the lag in time that it takes for heat to make its way through the interior of the comet."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable for being the largest and possibly the oldest interstellar object observed to date. Its features, including jets and a greenish glow caused by diatomic carbon emissions, have drawn attention from astronomers. Previous comets have exhibited similar behaviors when activated by solar proximity.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth, astronomers will continue to monitor its activity for potential outbursts and changes in composition. Observations will focus on how the comet behaves as it begins to cool after its solar encounter.</p>
