      <h2>UFOs over Cincinnati this weekend? Don't be alarmed. It's not aliens, but it's pretty cool</h2>

<p>The International Space Station (ISS) will be visible over the Cincinnati area five times between May 24 and May 27, 2023. This event poses no safety concerns, as the bright object observed in the sky is not extraterrestrial but a manned spacecraft orbiting the Earth.</p>

<p>This sighting matters because it offers residents a unique opportunity to witness one of humanity's significant achievements in space exploration. The ISS circles the Earth approximately every 90 minutes and can often be seen just after sunset or just before sunrise. Currently, there are seven astronauts aboard the station, including four Americans and three Russians.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>ISS flybys scheduled for May 24 to May 27, 2023.</li>
    <li>Visible five times in total during the evening hours.</li>
    <li>Current crew: four Americans and three Russians aboard the ISS.</li>
    <li>First pass on May 24 from 9:52 p.m. to 9:58 p.m.</li>
    <li>Last pass on May 27 from 10:35 p.m. to 10:39 p.m.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The ISS will follow a specific schedule for flybys over Cincinnati:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>May 24</strong>: 
        <ul>
            <li>First pass from 9:52 p.m. to 9:58 p.m., low in the northern sky.</li>
            <li>Second pass from 11:29 p.m. to 11:31 p.m., facing northwest.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>May 25</strong>: 10:39 p.m. to 10:43 p.m., facing north-northwest.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The ISS is unmistakable from Earth, appearing as a very bright, non-twinkling star that moves slowly across the sky,” said an expert on the ISS.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior sightings of the ISS have drawn attention from the public, often leading to speculation about UFOs. This weekend's flybys provide a clear reminder that many of the lights seen in the night sky can be explained by human-made technology.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Residents are encouraged to look up during the scheduled times to experience this remarkable event. No further actions or investigations are planned regarding the ISS flybys.</p>
