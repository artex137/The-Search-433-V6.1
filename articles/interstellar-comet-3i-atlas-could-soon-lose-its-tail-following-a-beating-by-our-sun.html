      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/Atlas could soon lose its tail following a beating by our Sun</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/Atlas is set to encounter a coronal mass ejection (CME) from the Sun on September 25, 2025, potentially affecting its structure. The comet is currently travelling at a speed of 221,000 km/h and is approaching Mars.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it marks the first known instance of a CME colliding with an interstellar comet. Scientists are monitoring the situation closely to understand the implications of this interaction. The comet has a mass of over 33 billion tons and presents intriguing anomalies compared to other known comets.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas is expected to encounter a CME on September 25, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet is moving at a speed of 221,000 km/h.</li>
    <li>It has a nucleus measuring over 5.6 kilometres.</li>
    <li>3I/Atlas has a mass of over 33 billion tons.</li>
    <li>The comet will pass near Mars on October 3, 2025.</li>
    <li>NASA's STEREO A spacecraft previously observed a CME interacting with Comet Encke on April 20, 2007.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas is currently on a trajectory coming from outside the solar system. It has been observed to develop a dusty coma and a tail after weeks of absence. The comet will come close to Mars on October 3, 2025, allowing several Mars missions to observe it.</p>
<p>On September 25, 2025, a CME is predicted to collide with 3I/Atlas, which may result in the comet losing its tail. The interaction is a unique event, as it occurs while only the third interstellar comet is passing through the solar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “NASA doesn’t think that the comet’s path will be altered by the solar plasma,” a NASA representative said regarding the expected CME collision.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas is the third known interstellar comet, following ‘Oumuamua and Comet Borisov. Past interactions between comets and solar plasma have resulted in observable changes, such as the tail of Comet Encke breaking off during a CME event in 2007.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will monitor 3I/Atlas closely as it approaches Mars and the predicted CME collision. Observations from Mars missions will provide valuable data on the comet's characteristics and any changes resulting from the CME impact.</p>
