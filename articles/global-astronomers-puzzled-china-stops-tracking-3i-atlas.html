      <h2>Global astronomers puzzled: China stops tracking 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>China has ceased observations of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS shortly after its flyby of Mars in early September 2023, raising concerns among scientists around the world.</p>

<p>This decision has prompted discussions regarding the reasons behind the halt, with suggestions ranging from technical limitations to changes in national priorities. The China National Space Administration has attributed the tracking pause to “instrument scheduling conflicts,” as resources are redirected towards the upcoming Chang’e-7 lunar mission.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS passed Mars in early September 2023.</li>
    <li>The tracking stop occurred after a signal drop recorded by the Xinjiang 35-metre radio dish.</li>
    <li>China’s Purple Mountain Observatory confirmed the comet’s interstellar origin in August 2023.</li>
    <li>Chinese observatories have shifted focus to lunar and orbital projects.</li>
    <li>International researchers have expressed concerns over the lack of data and its implications for scientific understanding.</li>
    <li>Observatories in Europe and India have continued to monitor 3I/ATLAS post-China's withdrawal.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In August 2023, China’s Purple Mountain Observatory and the national Deep Space Network confirmed the interstellar origin of comet 3I/ATLAS. As the comet approached Mars in early September, a signal drop was recorded by the Xinjiang 35-metre radio dish. Shortly thereafter, the China National Astronomical Data Centre stopped posting updates, creating a sudden information gap.</p>
<p>Officials from the China National Space Administration reported that the tracking halt was due to reallocation of observatories to prepare for the Chang’e-7 lunar mission and to calibrate the Queqiao-2 relay satellite. This shift in focus has led to criticism from the international scientific community.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Each missed observation weakens scientists’ ability to understand 3I/ATLAS,” said Harvard physicist Avi Loeb. “The comet might never be observed again once it passes behind the Sun.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Chinese researchers have suggested that deep-space signals may be reclassified when they overlap with military frequencies, potentially impacting data sharing.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The decision to stop tracking 3I/ATLAS follows a trend of restricted data release from Chinese observatories. A similar situation occurred in 2022 when information regarding a small asteroid’s atmospheric entry was withheld. Concerns have been raised about the impact of military operations on scientific transparency.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Observatories in Europe and India will continue to monitor comet 3I/ATLAS, sharing data through the Minor Planet Center to maintain trajectory models. The international scientific community will likely push for improved data sharing practices from China.</p>
