      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Approaches Earth</h2>
<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is set to make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, passing at a distance of 167 million miles (270 million kilometers). NASA has confirmed that the comet poses no threat to our planet during this event.</p>

<p>This close encounter has generated significant interest among scientists and astronomers globally. As one of only three known interstellar objects to enter the solar system, 3I/ATLAS has exhibited unusual behavior, including color variations and fluctuations in its tail. NASA and other agencies continue to monitor the comet as it remains visible to telescopes and space missions for several months following its approach.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS will approach Earth on December 19, 2025.</li>
  <li>It will pass at a distance of 167 million miles (270 million kilometers).</li>
  <li>NASA has confirmed the comet poses no threat to Earth.</li>
  <li>It is the third known interstellar object to enter the solar system.</li>
  <li>Viewing requires a telescope with at least an 8-inch aperture.</li>
  <li>Best viewing time is during the eastern predawn hours.</li>
  <li>X-ray emissions have been detected around the comet's nucleus.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been monitored by multiple space missions, including NASA spacecraft near Mars and the European Space Agency's Juice mission. The comet has displayed unpredictable behavior, prompting interest from researchers. Observations have shown that it emits X-rays, a common occurrence for comets when interacting with solar wind.</p>

<p>NASA has reassured the public that 3I/ATLAS will remain at a safe distance from Earth, coming no closer than approximately 170 million miles (275 million kilometers).</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS is an intriguing interstellar visitor, and while it has generated speculation, its characteristics are consistent with natural cometary activity,” NASA stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The comet's unusual traits have led to various online speculations, including claims of it being an alien spacecraft. However, researchers emphasize that such characteristics are typical for comets. This event marks a significant opportunity for scientific study and public engagement with astronomy.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Observers are encouraged to prepare for viewing 3I/ATLAS using appropriate equipment and tools. NASA and other agencies will continue to monitor the comet’s activity as it progresses through the solar system.</p>
