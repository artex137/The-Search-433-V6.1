      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS: How and when to observe the rare cosmic visitor before its December 19 close approach to Earth</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is set to make its close approach to Earth on December 19, 2023. This rare cosmic visitor was first discovered in 2019 and has since been noted for its unique trajectory through the solar system.</p>

<p>Observing 3I/ATLAS is significant for astronomers and space enthusiasts as it provides an opportunity to study the characteristics of interstellar objects. Authorities and organizations, including NASA and various observatories, have prepared to assist the public in viewing this comet during its approach.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Close approach date:</strong> December 19, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery year:</strong> 2019</li>
    <li><strong>Type:</strong> Interstellar comet</li>
    <li><strong>Agencies involved:</strong> NASA, various observatories</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in 2019 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS). Since its discovery, it has been monitored as it travels through the solar system. The comet's trajectory has brought it closer to Earth, leading to increased interest in its upcoming approach.</p>

<p>As the December 19 date approaches, astronomers have been preparing observation strategies to maximize public engagement and scientific study. Various observatories will host events to facilitate public viewing.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The approach of 3I/ATLAS offers a unique chance to observe an interstellar object and learn more about our solar system's formation,” said a representative from NASA.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interstellar comets are rare, with only a few known to have passed through the solar system. The study of such objects provides critical insights into the materials that exist beyond our solar system and the conditions under which they formed.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As December 19 nears, observatories will finalize their plans for public viewing events. Astronomers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS to gather data during its close approach.</p>
