      <h2>NASA puts 3I/ATLAS on threat list for first time in history, activates planetary defense</h2>

<p>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has added the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS to its list of threats for the first time in history as of October 21, 2025. The object has exhibited unusual activity, including reversing its thrust as it passed the Sun, which has raised concerns among astronomers and prompted NASA to deploy planetary defense tools.</p>

<p>This decision is significant as it marks a proactive approach to planetary defense against unidentified objects. NASA is collaborating with the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN), a United Nations-backed group focused on Earth’s defense against near-Earth objects. A special training exercise is scheduled to take place from November 27, 2025, to January 27, 2026, to further prepare for potential threats.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of threat addition: October 21, 2025</li>
    <li>Interstellar object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>IAWN: International Asteroid Warning Network</li>
    <li>Training exercise: November 27, 2025 – January 27, 2026</li>
    <li>NASA's response: Deployment of planetary defense tools</li>
    <li>Notable observation: "Anti-tail" phenomenon</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been observed exhibiting unusual properties, including a phenomenon referred to as an "anti-tail," where particles are emitted towards the Sun instead of away from it. This behavior was noted prior to its passage behind the Sun, making it invisible to Earth's telescopes.</p>

<p>On October 21, 2025, NASA officially added 3I/ATLAS to the threat list managed by IAWN, marking a historic first for an interstellar object. Following this, IAWN announced plans for a special training exercise to enhance readiness for potential threats from near-Earth objects.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The addition of 3I/ATLAS to our threat list is unprecedented. We are taking all necessary precautions to ensure the safety of our planet,” said an IAWN representative.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This action follows previous observations of 3I/ATLAS, which have raised speculation about its nature. Harvard astrophysicist Dr. Avi Loeb has suggested that the unusual behavior could indicate that it might be an alien UFO. The ongoing developments have prompted increased scrutiny and interest in planetary defense mechanisms.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA has not released further statements due to the ongoing U.S. government shutdown. The upcoming training exercise from November 27, 2025, to January 27, 2026, will aim to prepare agencies for future encounters with potentially hazardous celestial objects.</p>
