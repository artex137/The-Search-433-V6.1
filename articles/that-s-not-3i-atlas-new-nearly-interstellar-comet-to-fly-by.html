      <h2>That's Not 3I/ATLAS: New 'Nearly Interstellar' Comet to Fly By</h2>

<p>A new comet, C/2025 V1 (Borisov), is set to make a close flyby of Earth today, November 11, 2025. This object has generated excitement as it is often confused with the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which has been the focus of attention among astronomers. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this event.</p>

<p>The arrival of Comet C/2025 V1 (Borisov) highlights the dynamic nature of our solar system, which is often perceived as predictable. Astronomers have clarified that while both comets share similarities, they are distinct objects. Authorities and observatories worldwide are actively tracking C/2025 V1 and educating the public to reduce confusion regarding its identity.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet C/2025 V1 (Borisov) will pass Earth at a distance of approximately 103,119,940 kilometres (0.68 AU).</li>
    <li>Perihelion, or closest approach to the Sun, is scheduled for November 16, 2025.</li>
    <li>Peak brightness of C/2025 V1 is 14.6 magnitude, making it invisible to the naked eye.</li>
    <li>Stargazers will require a telescope with at least a 20-inch aperture to observe it.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS, discovered in July 2025, is a confirmed interstellar object.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS reached perihelion on October 30, 2025, and will approach Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of 270 million kilometres (1.8 AU).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>November 11, 2025: Comet C/2025 V1 (Borisov) makes its closest approach to Earth.</p>
<p>October 30, 2025: Comet 3I/ATLAS reaches perihelion.</p>
<p>December 19, 2025: Comet 3I/ATLAS is scheduled to make its closest approach to Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The public confusion has been significant enough for astronomers to clarify the separate identities of these two cosmic snowballs,” an astronomer stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object to pass through our solar system, raising questions about the existence of large interstellar bodies. Its unusual behaviour and composition have intrigued scientists, prompting further study.</p>
<p>Comet C/2025 V1 (Borisov) is believed to originate from the Oort Cloud, a distant region of icy debris surrounding the solar system. This context emphasizes the differences between the two comets, despite their shared characteristics.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As Comet C/2025 V1 completes its flyby, astronomers will continue to study its composition and behaviour. Observations will help clarify the characteristics of both comets as they travel through our solar system.</p>
