      <h2>The real mystery isn’t UFOs — it’s what the government won’t explain</h2>

<p>A memo reportedly placed in President Donald Trump’s hands in February 2025 has reframed the debate around trust and transparency regarding unidentified flying objects (UFOs) and unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs). Dr. Steven Greer, founder of the Disclosure Project, confirmed that he was asked to write a one-page briefing document for the president, which he claims was delivered directly to Trump.</p>

<p>This memo highlights concerns about a deep state organization allegedly involved in manipulating UFO-related information, which Greer states poses a threat to national security. The memo has raised questions about the government's transparency and the extent of its knowledge about UFOs.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of memo: February 9, 2025</li>
    <li>Author: Dr. Steven M. Greer, MD</li>
    <li>Recipient: President Donald J. Trump</li>
    <li>Key claims: Corruption, reverse-engineered technology, and potential criminal operations</li>
    <li>Number of whistleblowers interviewed: over 700</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In early 2025, the Trump administration approached Dr. Steven Greer to draft a briefing document regarding UFOs and UAPs. Greer completed the document and stated it was placed in Trump’s hands. Following this, Trump reportedly expressed interest in pursuing the matter further.</p>

<p>Greer’s memo alleges that a corrupt organization has operated in secrecy since the 1950s, engaging in activities that threaten national and international security. The document calls for urgent executive action to address these concerns.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I want to pursue this,” Trump reportedly said after reading the memo, according to Greer.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“There is not a distant second. I will provide any assistance, advice and evidence that you and your administration require,” Greer stated in his memo to the president.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This memo comes amid increasing public interest in UFOs and UAPs, particularly following recent government reports and testimonies from military personnel. The topic has sparked debates about governmental secrecy and the potential existence of non-human intelligence. Concerns about the implications of these issues have led to calls for greater transparency from authorities.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the Trump administration seeks to address the claims made in Greer’s document, further investigations may be initiated to explore the allegations regarding the deep state and UFOs. The administration's next steps remain to be disclosed.</p>
