      <h2>3I/ATLAS Trajectory Refined By NASA Psyche as UN Initiates Massive Two-Month Planetary-Defense Drill</h2>

<p>A celestial visitor, the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, has prompted NASA and the United Nations to enhance global planetary defense efforts. The comet is currently traveling through space and has provided an opportunity for NASA's Psyche spacecraft to refine its trajectory while participating in a two-month planetary-defense exercise that began on 27 November 2025 and will run through 27 January 2026.</p>

<p>This initiative aims to improve humanity's ability to detect and measure potential threats from space. The International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN), in collaboration with NASA and other agencies, is using 3I/ATLAS as a test case to practice precise position measurements of comets, which present unique challenges compared to asteroids.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is approximately 33 million miles (53 million kilometres) away from NASA's Psyche spacecraft.</li>
    <li>The Psyche spacecraft is about 260 million miles (420 million kilometres) from Earth.</li>
    <li>The comet astrometry campaign began on 27 November 2025 and will conclude on 27 January 2026.</li>
    <li>The Psyche spacecraft will perform a gravity assist maneuver near Mars in May 2026.</li>
    <li>The mission aims to start orbiting the asteroid Psyche in July 2029.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>NASA's Psyche spacecraft has successfully locked onto 3I/ATLAS to refine its trajectory during observations conducted over an eight-hour period on 8 and 9 September 2023. The data captured during this time has provided insights into the comet's physical characteristics.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the IAWN has initiated a coordinated effort to enhance global preparedness against potential near-Earth objects, with the current exercise focusing on the tracking and measurement of comets.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The selection of this specific comet was not accidental. 3I/ATLAS was chosen because it is faint but trackable for months, is scientifically compelling, and poses no threat,” according to IAWN’s campaign page.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This exercise represents the eighth IAWN observing drill since 2017. It is part of broader efforts to coordinate a global response to potential future near-Earth objects, emphasizing the importance of planetary defense.</p>

<p>The ongoing work of NASA's Psyche mission, along with other space missions, supports the agency's commitment to finding, tracking, and understanding solar system objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The Psyche mission team is preparing for the Mars gravity assist in May 2026, which will adjust the spacecraft's trajectory for its journey to the asteroid Psyche, where it is expected to begin its prime mission in July 2029.</p>
