      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Glows Green as It Approaches Earth</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has brightened and developed a greenish glow as it nears Earth, according to recent observations from the Gemini North telescope in Hawaii. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to the comet's approach.</p>

<p>This development is significant as it provides fresh insights into the comet's composition. Authorities, including astronomers from NOIRLab, are closely monitoring the comet's activity as it approaches its closest point to Earth on December 19, 2023.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is expected to reach its closest point to Earth on December 19, 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet will be approximately 170 million miles (270 million kilometers) away from Earth.</li>
    <li>It travels at a speed of about 130,000 miles per hour (210,000 km/h).</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object ever discovered.</li>
    <li>Observations show a change in color from reddish to green due to diatomic carbon (C2).</li>
    <li>Heightened activity was noted following its close pass by the Sun at the end of October.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected in late June 2023. Observations in late August showed the comet appeared reddish. Following its close approach to the Sun at the end of October, heightened activity was noted, culminating in a greenish glow observed on November 26 from the summit of Mauna Kea.</p>

<p>As the comet continues its journey, astronomers are studying its behavior in response to solar heating, which has caused the icy surface to sublimate.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Many comets have a delayed reaction in experiencing the Sun's heat due to the lag in time that it takes for heat to make its way through the interior of the comet. A delay can activate the evaporation of new chemicals or trigger a comet outburst,” a representative from NOIRLab said.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable as the third interstellar object ever discovered, following 1I/‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Its detection offers a rare opportunity to study material from beyond our solar system, providing insights into the early formation of star systems in the Milky Way Galaxy.</p>

<p>Despite speculation about its nature, the scientific consensus is that 3I/ATLAS is a natural object, not artificial or extraterrestrial technology.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth, focusing on its size, trajectory, composition, and potential for increased activity before or after its closest approach.</p>
