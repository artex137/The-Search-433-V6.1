      <h2>Confirmed by NASA - the mysterious impact between a missile and a UFO was not, according to experts, what it appeared to be</h2>

<p>On October 30, 2024, a video showing a missile impact with an unidentified object off the coast of Yemen has drawn significant attention, including from the United States Congress. The video, captured by a military thermal camera, depicts a Hellfire missile striking a shiny spherical object, which has led to widespread speculation about extraterrestrial technology. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with the incident.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as it raises questions about the nature of unidentified aerial phenomena and the military's response to such incidents. Experts have since clarified that the video does not depict alien technology but rather an optical illusion involving a classified missile system. The U.S. military has not publicly authenticated the video, citing operational security concerns.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of incident: October 30, 2024</li>
    <li>Location: Off the coast of Yemen</li>
    <li>Type of missile: Hellfire missile</li>
    <li>Drone used: MQ-9 Reaper</li>
    <li>Altitude of drone: Approximately 7,620 meters (25,000 feet)</li>
    <li>Expert consulted: Dr. Fred Lamb, University of Illinois</li>
    <li>US Congress involvement: Yes, video has been discussed</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 30, 2024, an MQ-9 Reaper drone fired a Hellfire missile at a shiny spherical object off the coast of Yemen. The incident was recorded by a military thermal camera. Video footage showed the missile appearing to bounce off the object without any visible explosion. Following the video's release, speculation about alien technology surged online.</p>
<p>Experts, including Dr. Fred Lamb, later explained that the apparent impact was an optical illusion caused by the camera's perspective. The object was believed to be moving slowly, influenced by wind at high altitude.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This was an illusion known as ‘Parallax Motion,’” said Dr. Fred Lamb, explaining the phenomenon that misled viewers. “The object appears to be moving at high speed, but it is not.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The Army is not going to publish any information that could give clues to other countries,” a military source stated regarding the classified nature of the missile and operation.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident is part of an ongoing discussion about unidentified aerial phenomena and military engagements in high-tension areas. Previous reports have indicated that the U.S. military has been actively using drones to combat threats from Houthi rebels in Yemen. The secrecy surrounding military operations can often lead to misunderstandings and speculation among the public.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the incident may continue internally within the military, but no public disclosures are expected due to the classified nature of the operation and the technology involved.
