      <h2>Is Donald Trump going to make an announcement on what the US knows about UFOs?</h2>

<p>Donald Trump may make an official announcement regarding the United States' knowledge of UFOs, or Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena, according to recent rumors. This speculation follows comments made by former President Barack Obama over the weekend, which some interpret as an indication of the existence of extraterrestrial life.</p>

<p>The US government has been collecting classified files on UFOs, with ongoing discussions about the release of this information. Congressman Eric Burlison stated that the White House has instructed the Department of Defense to facilitate the release of details related to secret UFO facilities and research. While it remains unclear if Trump will make a public statement, sources indicate he may do so prior to the start of the World Cup.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Former President Barack Obama made comments suggesting the existence of extraterrestrials.</li>
    <li>Congressman Eric Burlison stated the White House has directed the Department of Defense to release UFO-related information.</li>
    <li>Trump has reportedly permitted the release of information linked to secret UFO facilities.</li>
    <li>Former armed forces veterans have testified about UFO encounters in 2023 and 2024.</li>
    <li>Dr. Tim Gallaudet described a near mid-air collision with a UFO during a Navy exercise in 2015.</li>
    <li>Former AATIP program manager Luis Elizondo has claimed that secret groups have collected alien remains for over 50 years.</li>
    <li>Mexico has also held congressional hearings on UFOs, which included controversial claims about non-human beings.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In recent years, the US government has focused on the investigation of UFO sightings and encounters. In 2015, Dr. Tim Gallaudet received an urgent message regarding safety concerns related to UFOs during a Navy exercise.</p>

<p>In 2023 and 2024, former military personnel testified before Congress about their experiences with unidentified phenomena. These testimonies have reignited public interest in the government's handling of UFO information.</p>

<p>On February 17, 2026, rumors surfaced that Trump might make an announcement regarding UFOs, coinciding with Obama’s recent comments about extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The White House has told the DoD to make it happen. The extent to which they’ve been involved is literally just saying to the Department of Defence, we’re backing his request. Do what you can to make it happen.”</blockquote>
<cite>— Congressman Eric Burlison</cite>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interest in UFOs has grown significantly in the past few years. Previous incidents, such as the Roswell crash in 1947, have fueled speculation about government cover-ups related to extraterrestrial life. Politicians and military veterans have called for greater transparency regarding the research and findings of unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>

<p>In Mexico, similar interest has led to congressional hearings on UFOs, further highlighting the international focus on unexplained aerial phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The Department of Defense is expected to continue its investigation into UFO sightings and may release additional information related to the topic. There is no confirmed timeline for an announcement from Trump or the White House at this time.</p>
