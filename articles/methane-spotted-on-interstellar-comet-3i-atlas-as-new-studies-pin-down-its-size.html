      <h2>Methane spotted on interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as new studies pin down its size</h2>

<p>New studies have reported the first direct detection of methane in interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, as well as a larger-than-expected nucleus size, according to findings released on February 2, 2026. The observations were made in December 2025 using the James Webb and Hubble space telescopes.</p>

<p>The significance of these findings lies in the rarity of such interstellar visitors. There have only been three confirmed interstellar objects observed in the solar system, each providing a unique opportunity to study celestial formation processes. Researchers are working to understand the new chemical and size data as comet 3I/ATLAS exits the inner solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of findings: February 2, 2026</li>
    <li>Observation period: December 2025</li>
    <li>Comet nucleus size: approximately 2.6 km (1.6 miles) across</li>
    <li>Detection methods: James Webb and Hubble space telescopes</li>
    <li>First sighting of 3I/ATLAS: July 2025</li>
    <li>Estimated effective radius: 1.3 km based on Hubble observations</li>
    <li>Comet's perihelion: closest point to the sun, observed after this event</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first spotted in July 2025 by the ATLAS survey in Chile. Following this, NASA and other organizations began tracking the comet with multiple instruments. In December 2025, new observations conducted by the James Webb and Hubble telescopes reported the detection of methane in the comet's gas cloud, along with an estimated nucleus size of approximately 2.6 km. On February 2, 2026, these findings were officially released.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb, a Harvard scientist, emphasized the importance of the nucleus size, stating, "the nucleus is inferred to have an effective diameter of 2.6 (±0.4) kilometers."</blockquote>
<blockquote>Nicola Fox from NASA dismissed speculation about the comet being anything other than a comet, calling it "our friendly solar system visitor."</blockquote>
<blockquote>Chris Lintott stated, "The idea that 3I/ATLAS could be an alien spacecraft is simply nonsense."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I/ATLAS, only two other interstellar objects, 'Oumuamua in 2017 and Borisov in 2019, had been confirmed within the solar system. The detection of methane and the size estimates provide valuable insight into the characteristics of interstellar comets, which may not be as rare as once believed but are challenging to detect.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further data may be forthcoming, as the European Space Agency's Jupiter mission, Juice, has observed the comet. However, the science data is expected to arrive only in February due to the spacecraft's operational constraints. Researchers will continue to analyze the findings as the studies are currently preprints, pending peer review.</p>
