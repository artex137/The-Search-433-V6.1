      <h2>UN Activates Planetary Defenses as 31/ATLAS Images Stun Scientists and Alien Speculation Continues</h2>

<p>The United Nations has activated Earth’s Planetary Defenses in response to new high-resolution images of the interstellar comet 31/ATLAS, launching a two-month global tracking effort that began on November 27. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with the comet.</p>

<p>This initiative is significant as it marks a full-scale test for Earth’s Planetary Defenses, according to the UN and the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN). Despite NASA and other international agencies asserting that the comet poses no threat, the unusual behavior of 31/ATLAS has captured public attention and sparked conspiracy theories.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The tracking campaign started on November 27 and will continue until January.</li>
    <li>31/ATLAS will reach its closest point to Earth on December 19.</li>
    <li>The initiative is coordinated by the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs.</li>
    <li>The decision to activate the planetary defense exercise was based on the comet’s unusual trajectory and extended observability.</li>
    <li>Public interest in the comet has intensified, prompting the global tracking effort.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 27, the UN initiated a global tracking campaign for the comet 31/ATLAS. This exercise is set to last until January, well after the comet's closest approach to Earth on December 19. The decision to activate the planetary defenses was made due to the comet's unusual behavior and the public's growing curiosity.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The incoming 31/ATLAS comet will serve as a full-scale test for Earth’s Planetary Defenses,” said a representative from the International Asteroid Warning Network.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This activation of planetary defenses is unprecedented and reflects the increasing interest in and monitoring of near-Earth objects. Past incidents involving asteroids and comets have prompted discussions about planetary defense strategies, but this is the first time a comet of this nature has been the focus of such extensive tracking efforts.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The global tracking effort will continue until the end of January, with ongoing assessments to monitor 31/ATLAS as it approaches Earth. Further updates will be provided as the situation develops.</p>
