      <h2>Private Jet Pilot Reports UFO Over Rhode Island</h2>
<p>A pilot of a private jet has reported encountering a mysterious silver, cylindrical object hovering near his aircraft at approximately 3,500 feet over Rhode Island. The incident occurred while flying near T.F. Green International Airport. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This sighting has raised questions among aviation experts and authorities about unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP). Air Traffic Control (ATC) has confirmed they did not receive prior reports of any objects in the area. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has stated that they document UAP sightings and share corroborated reports with the UAP Task Force.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Incident occurred at approximately 3,500 feet over Rhode Island.</li>
  <li>The object was described as a small, silver canister.</li>
  <li>The pilot was flying a Piper PA-32RT-300T Turbo Lance II.</li>
  <li>ATC recorded the communication with the pilot during the sighting.</li>
  <li>The FAA documents UAP sightings and collaborates on investigations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>During the flight, the pilot spotted a small silver object near the right wing tip of the aircraft. He communicated with ATC, describing the object as standing still and hovering. ATC asked the pilot if it could be a drone or balloon, to which the pilot replied that he saw nothing attached to the object. It was last seen floating alongside the aircraft before disappearing from view.</p>

<p>In response to the incident, ATC humorously wished the pilot "Good luck with the aliens," while other pilots chimed in on the radio expressing their curiosity about the sighting.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It appears to be standing still,” the pilot reported to ATC, adding, “Looks like a strange, small object that we just floated by.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Creepy,” said the ATC ground team during the communication.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident follows a series of recent UAP sightings reported by pilots and military personnel, which have garnered increased attention from both the public and government agencies. The FAA has emphasized its commitment to documenting these encounters and collaborating with other agencies to study UAP occurrences.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The FAA is expected to investigate the reported sighting further, particularly if supporting information such as radar data becomes available. The UAP Task Force will also review the incident as part of its ongoing assessment of unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>
