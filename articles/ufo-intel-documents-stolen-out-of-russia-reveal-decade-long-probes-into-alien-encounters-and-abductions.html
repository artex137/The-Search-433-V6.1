      <h2>UFO intel documents stolen out of Russia reveal decade-long probes into alien encounters and abductions</h2>

<p>Documents smuggled out of Russia and revealed on January 16 show that the Soviet Union investigated thousands of reports of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) and alien encounters over several decades. The documents, released by journalist George Knapp, detail investigations conducted by the USSR and the post-Soviet Russian Federation into UFO phenomena from 1979 until the early 1990s.</p>

<p>This release highlights the extent of Soviet interest in UFOs, despite official government denials. Authorities have not disclosed how many documents were released or their specific contents beyond the summaries provided by Knapp.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Documents smuggled out in 1993 by George Knapp.</li>
    <li>Investigations began with the “Network-AN” program in 1979.</li>
    <li>Other programs included “Galaxy-MD” (1981-1985), “Pluton 7” (1989-1990), and “Thread 3” (ongoing).</li>
    <li>Significant increase in UFO sightings reported after 1978.</li>
    <li>Notable incidents include a jellyfish-shaped UFO sighting in Nalchik on February 13, 1989.</li>
    <li>Claims of alien abductions, including one by Anatoly Malishev on July 21, 1975.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 1979, the Soviet Union initiated the “Network-AN” program to study UFO sightings. This was followed by several other investigations, including “Galaxy-MD” from 1981 to 1985 and “Pluton 7” in 1989 and 1990. The ongoing program “Thread 3” continues to examine these phenomena.</p>

<p>The documents reveal that the USSR officially dismissed UFO sightings as a fabrication by “American imperialists” in 1953. However, they began to take the reports seriously in the late 1970s, noting a significant increase in sightings and claims of encounters.</p>

<p>Among the documented incidents, an event on February 13, 1989, in Nalchik involved hundreds of witnesses observing a large jellyfish-shaped UFO. In another case, on July 21, 1975, Anatoly Malishev reported being abducted by aliens, who examined him and described their home planet as illuminated from within.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“By releasing these documents now, George Knapp is expanding the public record, showing not only how seriously Russia confronted the UFO phenomenon,” said investigative journalist Jeremy Corbell.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The release of these documents comes as interest in UFO phenomena has surged globally, with numerous governments, including the United States, beginning to acknowledge and investigate such reports. The Soviet Union's secretive approach to UFOs contrasts sharply with current transparency efforts.</p>

<p>Previous incidents of UFO sightings and alien encounters have often been dismissed or ridiculed, but these documents may prompt a reevaluation of how such reports are treated by authorities.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the UFO phenomena are expected to continue as researchers analyze the newly released documents. The implications of this information may lead to further studies and discussions about the existence of extraterrestrial life.</p>
