      <h2>3I/ATLAS Approaching Sun</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS, an interstellar comet discovered by the NASA-funded ATLAS survey telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile, is set to reach its closest point to the Sun on October 29. The comet, which poses no threat to Earth, is currently about 670 million kilometers away from the planet and will remain at least 240 million kilometers away during its closest approach.</p>

<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS has generated significant interest in planetary science. It is the third known interstellar object, following 1I/Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, discovered in 2017 and 2019, respectively. Authorities, including NASA, continue to monitor the comet's trajectory and characteristics as it approaches the Sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> July 1</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Earth at Discovery:</strong> 670 million kilometers</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to Sun:</strong> October 29</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Earth at Closest Approach:</strong> 240 million kilometers</li>
    <li><strong>Previous Interstellar Objects:</strong> 1I/Oumuamua (2017), 2I/Borisov (2019)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified on July 1 by the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile. Since its discovery, scientists have studied its unique properties and trajectory. The comet is expected to reach its closest point to the Sun on October 29, with a reappearance on the other side of the Sun anticipated by early December.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Darryl Seligman, a professor in the physics and astronomy department at Michigan State University, stated, "The discovery of 3I/ATLAS was a hugely exciting discovery."</blockquote>
<blockquote>NASA has confirmed that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object documented, following 1I/Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. These objects have been recognized for their hyperbolic orbits, indicating they are unbound from the solar system. The scientific community has shown keen interest in such discoveries as they provide insights into the formation of solar systems and the nature of celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches the Sun, scientists will continue to monitor its trajectory and characteristics. Further observations are expected when it reappears in early December.</p>
