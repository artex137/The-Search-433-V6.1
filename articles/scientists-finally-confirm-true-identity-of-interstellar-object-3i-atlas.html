      <h2>Scientists finally confirm true identity of interstellar object 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Scientists have confirmed that the interstellar object known as 3I/ATLAS is a comet, not an alien spacecraft, following new observations made at the Gemini South Observatory in Chile. The update comes as the object races toward the Sun at a speed of 137,000 miles per hour.</p>

<p>This confirmation is significant as it dispels conspiracy theories surrounding the object's origin. The observations, which included the first multi-color images of 3I/ATLAS captured on August 27, have provided clarity on its composition and characteristics, according to astronomers.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Speed: 137,000 miles per hour</li>
    <li>Observation date: August 27</li>
    <li>Location of observation: Gemini South Observatory, Chile</li>
    <li>Discovery of a CO2-rich atmosphere</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On August 27, astronomers at the Gemini South Observatory captured the first multi-color images of 3I/ATLAS. These images revealed the comet's icy nucleus and its surrounding coma, as well as a long tail extending away from the Sun. Following this observation, Dr. Mark Norris from the University of Lancashire confirmed that the object is a comet, countering earlier claims that it was an alien spacecraft.</p>

<p>Dr. Norris explained that the comet's brightness increases as it approaches the Sun, leading to its larger and brighter appearance. Scientists have also noted that 3I/ATLAS has a CO2-rich atmosphere with less water than most comets found in our solar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The new images clearly demonstrate that 3I/ATLAS is a comet,” said Dr. Mark Norris, challenging previous theories proposed by some astrophysicists.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“As 3I/ATLAS is moving towards the Sun, it gets more and more exposed to the heat,” Dr. Norris added, explaining the comet's unusual brightness.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This confirmation of 3I/ATLAS as a comet follows a growing interest in interstellar objects, particularly after the discovery of 'Oumuamua in 2017. The debate surrounding the nature of such objects often includes speculation about extraterrestrial origins, which has been a topic of discussion among scientists and the public alike.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun, gathering more data about its composition and behavior in the solar system.</p>
