      <h2>3I/ATLAS Live Tracker: Scientists explain reason for sudden brightening of interstellar comet</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has started to become visible again as it emerges from behind the Sun, according to researchers from the Lowell Observatory in Arizona. A photograph taken on October 31, 2025, shows the comet after it cleared the Sun's glare, prompting scientists to investigate the reasons behind its sudden brightening and other anomalies.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it may provide new insights into the characteristics of interstellar comets. Researchers from Harvard and the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) are analyzing the comet's behavior, including its unexpected increase in brightness and changes in color. They are exploring the possibility of a tenth anomaly related to the comet's interaction with the Sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS became visible again on October 31, 2025.</li>
    <li>The photograph was taken by the Lowell Discovery Telescope in Arizona.</li>
    <li>Harvard scientists, including Avi Loeb, are studying the comet's anomalies.</li>
    <li>Qicheng Zhang and Karl Battams have highlighted the comet's unusual brightening rates.</li>
    <li>The PUNCH mission has also captured images of 3I/ATLAS.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 31, 2025, the Lowell Discovery Telescope captured a photograph of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it emerged from behind the Sun. This marked the comet's return to visibility, allowing scientists to observe its properties and behavior closely.</p>

<p>Researchers have noted a sudden increase in the comet's brightness, a change in color, and non-gravitational acceleration. These phenomena have raised questions regarding the comet's interaction with the Sun and may lead to further discoveries.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb, a Harvard scientist, stated, "If we do not see what we think it should exhibit, then the interstellar comet might have a tenth anomaly."</blockquote>

<blockquote>Qicheng Zhang and Karl Battams wrote, "3I’s rapid brightening, which far exceeds the brightening rate of most Oort cloud comets at similar radial distances, remains unclear."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This recent activity surrounding 3I/ATLAS adds to the growing body of research on interstellar objects. Past observations of such comets have often led to unexpected findings, prompting scientists to reassess existing theories about these celestial bodies.</p>

<p>The ongoing study of 3I/ATLAS is part of a broader effort to understand interstellar comets and their origins, particularly as they interact with the Sun and other celestial phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it becomes more visible, analyzing data from various telescopes and satellites. Further studies may provide clarity on the comet's rapid brightening and its potential anomalies.</p>
