      <h2>New Hubble Images Reveal Unusual Rotating Jet Anomalies From 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Scientists have captured new images of comet 3I/ATLAS using the Hubble Space Telescope, revealing unusual rotating jet anomalies that have emerged from the interstellar object. The images were taken on December 27, 2025, following an earlier capture on November 30, 2025, and have raised questions about the comet's behavior.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it challenges existing models of comet behavior. The Planetary Defense Coordination Office at NASA and analysts at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) are currently monitoring the object closely to understand its trajectory and behavior, which may differ from known solar system comets.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first tracked in November 2025.</li>
    <li>Images were taken on November 30 and December 27, 2025.</li>
    <li>The November image featured a 260-second exposure; the December image had a 170-second exposure.</li>
    <li>Analysis conducted by astronomer Toni Scarmato.</li>
    <li>NASA's Planetary Defense Coordination Office is involved in monitoring the object.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 30, 2025, the Hubble Space Telescope captured a 260-second exposure of 3I/ATLAS, revealing its complex structure. A follow-up image taken on December 27 with a shorter exposure time showed unexpected changes in the comet's jets. The analysis of these images has led to new questions about the nature of the interstellar object.</p>

<p>The December image highlighted a significant change in the comet's jet structure, indicating a rapid reorganization of jets that does not conform to typical comet behavior.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“What we see here instead is a rapid reorientation of jets, with sharp boundaries and consistent angular spacing,” said Toni Scarmato, emphasizing the unusual behavior of the jets. “This behavior fits into a growing pattern documented over months of observation.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior observations of 3I/ATLAS have shown a pronounced anti-tail and unexpected non-gravitational acceleration. These features, along with the new jet anomalies, suggest that the comet may have an irregular nucleus with defined active regions. Scientists have noted that interstellar objects like 3I/ATLAS should not be assumed to behave like typical solar system comets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it moves deeper into the solar system. Further observations are expected to provide additional insights into the object's behavior and its implications for planetary defense.</p>
