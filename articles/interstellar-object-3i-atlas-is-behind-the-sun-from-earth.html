      <h2>Interstellar object 3I/ATLAS is behind the sun from Earth</h2>

<p>As of October 21, 2025, interstellar object 3I/ATLAS is located approximately 221 million miles (356 million km) from Earth, positioned behind the sun in Earth's sky, making it currently invisible from the planet. The object is on a hyperbolic trajectory through the solar system, with its closest approach to the sun scheduled for October 29, 2025.</p>

<p>This event is significant as 3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object and provides insights into the formation and evolution of solar systems. Astronomers and space agencies, including the European Space Agency (ESA), are preparing to observe the comet as it approaches perihelion, which will occur just inside the orbit of Mars. Observations from ESA’s Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) are expected to yield valuable data.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of closest approach to the sun: October 29, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth on October 21, 2025: 221 million miles (356 million km)</li>
    <li>Speed at perihelion: nearly 15,500 miles per hour (25,000 kph)</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth expected: December 19, 2025, at about 1.8 AU (168 million miles or 270 million km)</li>
    <li>Best viewing time with telescopes: Late November 2025</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Mars: October 3, 2025, at 4 UTC</li>
    <li>Distance from Mars at closest approach: approximately 18 million miles (29 million km)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 3, 2025, 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to Mars at 4 UTC, about 18 million miles away from the planet. During this period, the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) and Mars Express aimed their cameras at the comet, capturing images despite the challenges posed by the object's distance.</p>

<p>As of October 21, 2025, 3I/ATLAS is behind the sun from Earth's perspective and is not visible. The object is projected to reach perihelion on October 29, 2025, before continuing its journey out of the solar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS may nonetheless be an old object, consistent with ejection from a long-lived primordial planetesimal disk in an early-formed system,” said Xabier Pérez-Couto of the University of A Coruña in Spain.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object, following Oumuamua and Borisov. Its trajectory has been traced back 10 million years, but researchers have not identified a specific star responsible for its path into our solar system. The object’s study offers a glimpse into the galactic population of icy planetesimals, which are believed to play a crucial role in the formation of solar systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>After perihelion, 3I/ATLAS will exit the solar system. ESA’s JUICE will observe the comet in late November 2025, with data expected to be received by February 2026. NASA has also launched a dedicated page to track the object’s progress.</p>
