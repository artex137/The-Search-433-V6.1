      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS on November 28, 2025: UN Planetary-Defence Drill, NASA’s Verdict and How to See It</h2>

<p>On November 28, 2025, interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has become the focus of a United Nations-endorsed planetary-defence exercise and a significant NASA observation campaign, according to multiple sources. This event marks the third time an object from another star system has entered our Solar System.</p>

<p>The importance of this event lies in its implications for planetary defence and scientific research. The UN and the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) have confirmed that 3I/ATLAS is the official target for their latest global observing exercise, which aims to enhance international coordination in the event of a real threat.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1)</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to Sun:</strong> October 29-30, 2025, at 1.36 AU</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to Earth:</strong> December 19, 2025, at approximately 1.8 AU (about 270 million km)</li>
    <li><strong>Threat Level:</strong> Zero, according to NASA and international teams</li>
    <li><strong>Observation Campaign Duration:</strong> November 27, 2025, to January 27, 2026</li>
    <li><strong>Mid-Campaign Review:</strong> December 9, 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the NASA-funded ATLAS survey telescope in Chile. It passed closest to the Sun on October 29-30, 2025, and will reach its closest point to Earth on December 19, 2025. The UN and IAWN have designated it as the target for their observing exercise starting November 27, 2025.</p>

<p>NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and other spacecraft have provided crucial data to refine the comet's orbit, resulting in a ten-fold improvement in orbital precision. This data confirms that the comet will not come close to Earth in a hazardous manner.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS looks and behaves like a comet: it has an icy nucleus, a bright coma and a real tail driven by outgassing as it warms,” said a NASA official during a briefing.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“No technosignatures – there’s nothing in the data that looks like artificial emissions or engineered propulsion,” the official added, reiterating that the comet poses no threat to Earth or other planets.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This event is significant as it represents a collaborative effort among international agencies to prepare for potential threats from celestial objects. The IAWN has previously conducted drills, but 3I/ATLAS serves as a safe and scientifically valuable target for this exercise.</p>

<p>The ongoing discussion surrounding the comet has been fueled by claims on social media regarding its unusual appearance. However, astronomers have clarified that these claims do not indicate danger.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The observation campaign will continue until January 27, 2026, with a mid-campaign review scheduled for December 9, 2025. NASA and international teams will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS to gather more data and refine their understanding of its trajectory.</p>
