      <h2>WATCH: Did a UFO Really Get Hit by a Missile and Survive?</h2>

<p>On October 30, 2024, an MQ-9 Reaper drone reportedly tracked an unidentified flying object (UFO) off the coast of Yemen. The drone engaged the object with a U.S. Hellfire missile, which appeared to be ineffective against the target. This incident was revealed during a congressional hearing on September 8, 2025, by Representative Eric Burlison.</p>

<p>This event has sparked significant public interest and debate regarding the existence of extraterrestrial life. The video footage has been shared widely, with some lawmakers suggesting it may provide evidence of UFOs. Authorities are currently reviewing the video and assessing the implications of the incident.</p>
