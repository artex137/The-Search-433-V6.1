      <h2>Mysterious Object Headed for Inner Solar System Has Extremely Unusual Readings, James Webb Finds</h2>

<p>A comet known as 3I/ATLAS is making its way through the inner solar system, expected to reach its closest point to the Sun on October 30, 2023. Discovered in early July, this interstellar visitor is notable for its high speed and unusual chemical composition, which has intrigued astronomers worldwide.</p>

<p>The significance of 3I/ATLAS lies in its potential to provide insights into the formation of planetary systems. The James Webb Space Telescope has analyzed the comet using its Near-Infrared Spectrograph, revealing details about its size and composition. Preliminary findings suggest that 3I/ATLAS has one of the highest ratios of carbon dioxide to water observed in a comet, according to a study from NASA and various universities that is currently awaiting peer review.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Discovered: Early July 2023</li>
    <li>Speed: Over 138,000 miles per hour (approximately 222,000 kilometers per hour)</li>
    <li>Estimated age: 3 to 11 billion years</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun: October 30, 2023</li>
    <li>Trajectory: Originating from the center of the galaxy</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first spotted in July 2023. Since then, astronomers have tracked its trajectory and speed, confirming its interstellar origin. The James Webb Space Telescope conducted observations and provided new data on the comet's composition, which have been detailed in a study awaiting peer review.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Continued spectroscopic observations of interstellar objects have the potential to reveal crucial details on the physics and chemistry of planet formation in planetary systems other than our own,”</blockquote>
<p>the authors of the study stated.</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object to visit our solar system, following the discovery of Borisov, which also exhibited cometary activity. While Borisov showed similarities to well-studied comets, 3I/ATLAS's unusual carbon-to-water ratio sets it apart, indicating potential differences in its formation history.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches perihelion, scientists will continue to monitor its trajectory and gather data on its composition. The findings from the James Webb Space Telescope may offer new insights into the origins of this ancient comet.</p>
