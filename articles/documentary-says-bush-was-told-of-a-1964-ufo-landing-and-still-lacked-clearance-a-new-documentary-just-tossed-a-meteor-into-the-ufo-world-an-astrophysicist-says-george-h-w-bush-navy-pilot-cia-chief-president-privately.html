      <h2>Documentary Claims Bush Aware of 1964 UFO Landing</h2>
<p>A new documentary claims that former U.S. President George H.W. Bush was informed about a UFO landing at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico in 1964 but reportedly lacked the clearance to access further details. The film, titled <em>The Age of Disclosure</em>, features an astrophysicist who alleges that Bush, a former Navy pilot and CIA chief, privately discussed the incident where three unidentified craft descended on the base.</p>

<h2>Importance of the Claims</h2>
<p>This documentary raises questions about the extent of government knowledge regarding UFOs and the existence of a secretive “Legacy Program” allegedly operated by intelligence agencies. The claims, while not verified by physical evidence or government confirmation, suggest a significant level of secrecy surrounding UFO-related incidents, even at the highest levels of government.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Documentary title: <em>The Age of Disclosure</em></li>
<li>Allegation: Bush informed of a UFO landing in 1964</li>
<li>Location: Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico</li>
<li>Reported encounter: Three craft, one landing, a “non-human entity” present</li>
<li>Claimed response: Bush told he lacked clearance for more information</li>
<li>Physical evidence: Not disclosed</li>
<li>Government confirmation: Not disclosed</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>According to the documentary, in 1964, George H.W. Bush was allegedly briefed on a UFO landing at Holloman Air Force Base. The film claims that during this briefing, he witnessed three unidentified craft, one of which landed, and a non-human entity emerged. When Bush sought additional information, he was reportedly informed that he did not have the necessary clearance to access further details.</p>

<h2>Official Statements</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“Imagine being President and still hearing ‘need-to-know,’” the documentary states, highlighting the alleged limitations even the highest officials face regarding sensitive information.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The claims in this documentary contribute to an ongoing discussion about unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) and government transparency. Previous incidents and reports have raised public interest in the government’s knowledge of UFOs. However, the lack of confirmed evidence or acknowledgment from authorities continues to fuel speculation and debate.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The documentary is expected to generate further discussion and scrutiny regarding the government's handling of UFO information. There are currently no announced investigations or formal inquiries related to these claims.</p>
