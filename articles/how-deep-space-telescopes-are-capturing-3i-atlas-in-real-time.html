      <h2>How deep-space telescopes are capturing 3I/ATLAS in real time</h2>

<p>A unique comet from beyond our Solar System, 3I/ATLAS, is being closely tracked by powerful telescopes as it approaches the Sun. Discovered on 1 July 2025 by the NASA-funded ATLAS telescope in Chile, 3I/ATLAS will not come near Earth, but scientists are eager to study it for clues about its origin and nature.</p>

<p>This comet is significant as it is the third known comet to originate from outside our Solar System. It carries material from other parts of the galaxy, providing a unique opportunity for scientists to uncover secrets about interstellar objects. Both ground-based and space telescopes are engaged in monitoring 3I/ATLAS, ensuring continuous observation and data collection.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered: 1 July 2025</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun: 29 October 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from the Sun at closest point: 1.36 astronomical units (around 203 million kilometres)</li>
    <li>Estimated nucleus size: less than 1 kilometre wide; possible range between 0.32 and 5.6 kilometres</li>
    <li>Key telescopes involved: Hubble Space Telescope, James Webb Space Telescope, ATLAS survey, Very Large Telescope</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on 1 July 2025, marking its entry into the known comets from outside our Solar System. As it travels on a path that brings it close to the Sun, telescopes have been tracking its brightness and shape.</p>
<p>On 29 October 2025, 3I/ATLAS will reach its closest point to the Sun, approximately 1.36 astronomical units away. Following this, it will pass by Mars, Venus, and Jupiter before exiting the Solar System.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We are excited to study 3I/ATLAS as it provides us with a rare glimpse into the materials from other parts of the galaxy,” said a spokesperson from NASA. “The observations we gather will enhance our understanding of interstellar objects.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third comet identified as originating from outside the Solar System, which makes it an object of significant interest for astronomers. Previous interstellar comets, such as ‘Oumuamua and Comet 2I/Borisov, have also been studied to learn about the composition and behavior of celestial bodies from other star systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun and travels through the inner Solar System. Data from both ground-based and space telescopes will provide insights into its behavior and composition, enhancing our understanding of such interstellar objects.</p>
