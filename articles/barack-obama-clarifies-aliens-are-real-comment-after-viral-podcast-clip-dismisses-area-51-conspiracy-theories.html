      <h2>Barack Obama Clarifies ‘Aliens Are Real’ Comment After Viral Podcast Clip</h2>

<p>Former US President Barack Obama has clarified his comments regarding extraterrestrial life after a clip from a podcast interview went viral on social media. In the segment, recorded with YouTuber Brian Tyler Cohen, Obama stated, “They’re real,” in response to the question, “Are aliens real?” The remarks have sparked renewed interest and debate about UFOs and Area 51.</p>

<p>Obama’s clarification comes amid growing speculation about his comments and conspiracy theories surrounding Area 51, a classified US Air Force facility in Nevada. In a post on Instagram on February 15, Obama explained that his original statement was intended to be humorous and based on statistical reasoning rather than a confirmation of alien contact with Earth. He emphasized that, during his presidency, he saw no evidence of extraterrestrial visits.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Podcast recorded with Brian Tyler Cohen.</li>
    <li>Viral clip circulated widely on social media platforms.</li>
    <li>Obama's clarification posted on Instagram on February 15.</li>
    <li>Area 51 is a highly classified US Air Force facility in Nevada.</li>
    <li>No confirmed evidence of extraterrestrial contact with Earth.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In a podcast interview with Brian Tyler Cohen, Obama responded to a direct question about the existence of aliens on February 15, stating, “They’re real.” The brief answer quickly gained traction online, leading to widespread speculation about the existence of extraterrestrial life.</p>

<p>Following the viral moment, Obama released a clarification on Instagram, explaining his comments were made in a light-hearted context and were statistical in nature. He pointed out that while the universe is vast, the likelihood of alien visits to Earth is low.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Statistically, the universe is so vast that the odds are good there’s life out there. But the distances between solar systems are so great that the chances we’ve been visited by aliens are low, and I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. Really!”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“They’re not being kept in Area 51. There’s no underground facility, unless there’s this enormous conspiracy, and they hid it from the president of the United States.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Obama has previously discussed unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs), commonly referred to as UFOs. In 2021, he hinted at classified information regarding these phenomena during an appearance on The Late Late Show, acknowledging that while there is no confirmed evidence of extraterrestrial contact, there are records of unexplained aerial objects.</p>

<p>The renewed discussions about UFOs and Area 51 reflect a broader scientific dialogue about the possibility of life beyond Earth. While many astronomers believe life could exist elsewhere in the universe, experts agree that the vast distances involved make interstellar travel unlikely.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>In light of his recent comments, Obama aims to clarify public understanding of his views on extraterrestrial life and UFOs. He has emphasized that speculation surrounding alien contact remains unsubstantiated, and he has no new information on the topic.</p>
