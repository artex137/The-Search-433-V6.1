      <h2>UFO identified: fuel from European rocket illuminates night sky</h2>

<p>A mysterious spiral of light that illuminated the night sky over New Brunswick and much of eastern North America on Tuesday night has been identified as fuel dumped by a European Space Agency rocket. The incident occurred shortly after the Ariane 6 rocket launched from Kourou, French Guiana, at 6:02 p.m. local time.</p>

<p>This event matters as it highlights the impact of rocket launches on atmospheric conditions and public perception. Authorities and experts have clarified the situation, dispelling initial theories about unidentified flying objects (UFOs) and confirming the source of the light show.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The rocket launch took place at 6:02 p.m. on Tuesday.</li>
    <li>The launch site is located near Kourou, French Guiana.</li>
    <li>Ariane 6 carried the Copernicus Sentinel-1D satellite.</li>
    <li>The satellite was successfully placed into orbit 34 minutes post-launch.</li>
    <li>The altitude of the satellite's orbit is 693 kilometres.</li>
    <li>Reports of the light show extended as far west as Petawawa, Ontario.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On Tuesday at 6:02 p.m., the Ariane 6 rocket launched from Kourou, French Guiana. Approximately 34 minutes later, the Copernicus Sentinel-1D satellite separated from the rocket and entered orbit. During the launch, the rocket dumped excess fuel, which created the spiral light effect observed across eastern North America.</p>

<p>Witnesses, including Fredericton resident Aidan MacSwain, reported seeing the unusual light display while out walking. Initial speculation on social media included theories about UFOs and comets, but experts quickly identified the phenomenon as related to the rocket launch.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “We were just out walking the dog and saw two spiraling, bright tails coming from something in the sky,” said Fredericton resident Aidan MacSwain.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “It sounds like it is, indeed, whether it’s a fuel dump or the exhaust plume, but it is related to a rocket launch,” said Catherine Lovekin, a professor at Mount Allison University.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “As far as I know, there’s no major impacts from something like this and I think they happen infrequently enough that it’s not a huge problem,” Lovekin added.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident is part of a broader trend as rocket launches become more common. Experts note that such fuel dumps are necessary to ensure safety, as rockets typically carry extra fuel to avoid catastrophic failures during re-entry. Catherine Lovekin explained that the fuel is dumped at high altitudes where it quickly freezes, mitigating potential risks.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>No further investigations have been announced regarding this specific incident, as authorities have confirmed the nature of the light show and deemed it not a cause for concern.</p>
