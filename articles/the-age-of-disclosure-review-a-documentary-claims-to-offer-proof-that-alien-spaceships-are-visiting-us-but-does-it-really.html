      <h2>‘The Age of Disclosure’ Review: A Documentary Claims to Offer Proof that Alien Spaceships Are Visiting Us</h2>

<p>“The Age of Disclosure” premiered today at the South by Southwest (SXSW) festival. The documentary claims to provide compelling evidence that spaceships from other worlds are visiting Earth. The film has sparked interest, as many viewers are drawn to the topic of unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs).</p>

<p>The significance of this documentary lies in its presentation of testimonies from credible figures in the U.S. government and military. Authorities are increasingly focusing on UAPs, with the film contributing to ongoing discussions about national security and extraterrestrial technology.</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The film reflects a growing public interest in UAPs, often referred to as UFOs.
