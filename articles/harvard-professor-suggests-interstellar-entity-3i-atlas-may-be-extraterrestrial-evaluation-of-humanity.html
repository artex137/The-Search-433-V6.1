      <h2>Harvard Professor Suggests Interstellar Entity 3I/ATLAS May Be Extraterrestrial Evaluation of Humanity</h2>

<p>A Harvard professor has proposed that an unusual interstellar entity, known as 3I/ATLAS, may be a technology-driven evaluation tool sent by extraterrestrial beings. Professor Avi Loeb has called for immediate action as the object approaches Earth, which is expected to occur in the near future. While many in the scientific community have dismissed his theories, Loeb remains firm in his belief that this object warrants further examination.</p>

<p>The significance of this theory lies in the potential implications for humanity's understanding of extraterrestrial life. As 3I/ATLAS nears our solar system, discussions have intensified regarding its nature and origin, particularly in light of prior warnings from NASA and predictions by notable scientists, including the late Professor Stephen Hawking.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object name: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Current speed: Approximately 221,000 kilometers per hour</li>
    <li>Proposed communication date: March 14, 2026</li>
    <li>Potential close approach to Mars: October 3, 2023 (29 million kilometers)</li>
    <li>Professor Avi Loeb's affiliation: Harvard University</li>
    <li>Proposed use of NASA's Juno spacecraft for interception</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Professor Avi Loeb has suggested that 3I/ATLAS is not an ordinary comet, asserting that it generates its own light, which may indicate it functions as a mothership. He has recommended that humanity reach out to the entity.</p>

<p>On September 14, 2025, Loeb has calculated that NASA's Juno spacecraft could accelerate by 2.6 kilometers per second to approach 3I/ATLAS. If successful, this maneuver would allow for a potential communication attempt on March 14, 2026.</p>

<p>3I/ATLAS is also expected to come within 2.7 million kilometers of Mars shortly after October 3, 2023, which presents an opportunity for additional data collection using the HiRISE camera on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The photograph of 3I/ATLAS shows illumination patterns that diverge from typical comet behavior, resembling a vehicle turning on its headlights,” said Professor Loeb.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“This is a rare opportunity to study 3I/ATLAS closely,” he added, emphasizing the importance of intercepting the object.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discussions surrounding 3I/ATLAS reflect ongoing debates in the scientific community about the possibility of extraterrestrial life and the potential threats posed by celestial objects. Recent predictions by astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson have also highlighted concerns regarding asteroids and their potential impact on Earth.</p>

<p>Loeb's claims have stirred significant debate, particularly as they challenge conventional understanding and raise questions about humanity's place in the universe.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches, researchers will continue to evaluate its characteristics and potential for communication. Efforts to utilize NASA's Juno spacecraft and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter will be critical in gathering data and assessing the feasibility of an interception attempt.</p>
