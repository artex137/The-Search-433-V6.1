      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS exhibits asymmetric coma in recent record</h2>

<p>An image captured by astrophotographer Efrain Morales in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico on November 17, 2025, reveals the continued activity of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, almost three weeks after its perihelion passage on October 29. The image shows the comet's active coma and elongated tail, which are driven by solar heating that releases gas and dust. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities associated with this astronomical event.</p>

<p>This observation matters as it confirms the comet's persistence despite expectations of a loss of brightness. Scientists from NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) are monitoring 3I/ATLAS to gain insights into its unique composition, which differs from local comets. The comet's asymmetric coma indicates an unexpected emission of material post-perihelion, contributing to global data on interstellar dynamics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS passed perihelion on October 29, 2025.</li>
    <li>The image was taken on November 17, 2025, at Aguadilla, Puerto Rico.</li>
    <li>The comet travels at a speed of 221,000 km/h.</li>
    <li>Distance from the Sun is currently 190 million miles.</li>
    <li>The closest approach to Earth will occur on December 19, 2025, at 269 million km.</li>
    <li>Preliminary data indicate a diameter of 5 to 11 km.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 2, 2025, records from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter showed a halo of gas and dust around the comet as it passed near Mars. Following this, the comet reached perihelion on October 29, 2025, continuing to emit jets of dust and gas.</p>
<p>On November 3, 2025, observatories in Chile, including Gemini Sul, captured images of the comet, revealing an expansive coma over 56,000 km long. The comet was also recorded by the Projeto Telescópio Virtual in Italy on November 11, showcasing a narrow ionic tail.</p>
<p>The latest image from Aguadilla on November 17 highlights the comet's ongoing activity, with scientists observing its features and changes in detail.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The asymmetric coma reveals a surprising emission of post-perihelion material,” said a representative from NASA. “This data is crucial for understanding interstellar dynamics.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This event follows the detection of 2I/Borisov in 2019, another interstellar comet that exhibited different characteristics. Observations of 3I/ATLAS confirm the absence of technological signatures, reinforcing its classification as a natural comet, which provides valuable information about the formation of ancient star systems predating the Solar System by up to 8 billion years.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and ESA will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS through upcoming space missions, including the JUICE mission, which is scheduled for data collection between November 2 and 25, 2025. Ground-based telescopes will track the comet's post-perihelion brightness, and data will support IAWN warning exercises until January 2026.</p>
