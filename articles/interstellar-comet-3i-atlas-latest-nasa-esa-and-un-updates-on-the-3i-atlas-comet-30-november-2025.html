      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Sparks Global Scientific Response</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, also known as C/2025 N1, is currently traversing the solar system after a close approach to the Sun on 30 October 2025. The comet, confirmed as the third known interstellar object, has prompted an extensive response from NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), and the United Nations.</p>

<p>The significance of 3I/ATLAS lies in its unique interstellar origin and the unprecedented global observation campaign it has inspired. Authorities are using this event as a full-scale test of planetary defence capabilities, with numerous spacecraft and telescopes actively tracking the comet as it heads back out of the solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> 1 July 2025 by the ATLAS telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile.</li>
  <li><strong>Closest Approach to Sun:</strong> 30 October 2025 at about 1.4 AU (≈130 million miles).</li>
  <li><strong>Expected Closest Approach to Earth:</strong> 19 December 2025 at approximately 1.8 AU (≈270 million km).</li>
  <li><strong>Current Location:</strong> In the constellation Virgo, about 1.9 AU from Earth.</li>
  <li><strong>Nucleus Size:</strong> Estimated between 440 m and 5.6 km in diameter.</li>
  <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Entered the solar system at about 137,000 mph (221,000 km/h); increased to 153,000 mph (246,000 km/h) near the Sun.</li>
  <li><strong>Observation Campaign:</strong> Involves a dozen NASA assets and several ESA missions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on 1 July 2025 by the ATLAS telescope in Chile. It entered the solar system moving at approximately 137,000 mph. The comet made its closest approach to the Sun on 30 October 2025 and is now heading back out towards interstellar space.</p>

<p>As of 30 November 2025, 3I/ATLAS is about 1.9 AU from Earth. It is expected to pass no closer than 270 million km on 19 December 2025. The comet has been the focus of a global observation campaign since its discovery, with numerous spacecraft collecting data.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS is only the third known object to pass through our system from interstellar space,” said a NASA representative. “Its orbit is so open that it’s described as a hyperbolic fly-through.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The data we are collecting will significantly enhance our understanding of interstellar comets and contribute to future planetary defence efforts,” stated an ESA spokesperson.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object identified, following 1I/‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Its discovery has highlighted advancements in planetary defence capabilities, particularly through international collaboration among space agencies.</p>

<p>The object’s hyperbolic orbit confirms it is not bound to the Sun and will not return, emphasizing the importance of tracking such celestial bodies to assess potential risks to Earth.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and ESA will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS until its closest approach to Earth on 19 December 2025. Data collected during this period will be analyzed to improve planetary defence strategies for future interstellar objects.</p>
