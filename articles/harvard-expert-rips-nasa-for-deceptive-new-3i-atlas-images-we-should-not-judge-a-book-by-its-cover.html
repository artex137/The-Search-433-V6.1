      <h2>Harvard expert rips NASA for ‘deceptive’ new 3I/ATLAS images</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has criticized NASA’s recent high-resolution images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, calling them “fuzzy” and inadequate for drawing conclusions about the object’s nature. Loeb made his remarks in a Medium post following the images' unveiling on November 20, 2025, during a conference at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.</p>

<p>This criticism is significant as it raises questions about the true nature of 3I/ATLAS, which is currently hurtling through space at approximately 246,000 kilometers per hour. NASA has stated that the comet is of cometary provenance, while Loeb suggests it could potentially be an artificial spacecraft. The debate over the comet's classification continues as both sides await further data to clarify its origins and characteristics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event: NASA unveiled new images of comet 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Date: November 20, 2025</li>
    <li>Location: NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland</li>
    <li>Speed of 3I/ATLAS: 246,000 kilometers per hour</li>
    <li>Loeb's analysis: Will assess images for additional information</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2025, at approximately 267 million kilometers away</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 3, 2025, images of 3I/ATLAS were captured by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter’s HiRISE camera and MAVEN Mars orbiter cameras during its flyby of Mars. The images were delayed due to a government shutdown, which ended prior to their release.</p>
<p>On November 20, 2025, NASA presented the images at a conference, prompting immediate criticism from Loeb, who has expressed skepticism regarding the agency's interpretation of the comet as a natural object.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Amit Kshatriya, NASA Associate Administrator, stated: “This object is a comet. It looks and behaves like a comet, and all evidence points to it being a comet.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb criticized NASA, saying: “NASA’s representatives should have emphasized what we do not understand about 3I/ATLAS rather than insist that it is a familiar comet from a new birth environment.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident is part of ongoing discussions in the scientific community regarding the classification of interstellar objects. Loeb has previously suggested that 3I/ATLAS could be an alien craft, a claim that has drawn mixed reactions from scientists.</p>
<p>The debate highlights the need for more data and analysis to determine the true nature of such celestial objects, especially as they approach Earth.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>In the coming weeks, larger ground-based telescopes, along with the Hubble and Webb telescopes, are expected to analyze 3I/ATLAS further. Loeb anticipates that this data will clarify whether the comet's jets are produced by natural processes or technological mechanisms. The closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, will provide additional opportunities for observation.</p>
