      <h2>3I/ATLAS update: Parker Solar Probe saw interstellar comet when it was invisible from Earth</h2>

<p>The Parker Solar Probe has captured images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS while it was obscured from view on Earth, according to the probe's team. The images were taken between October 18 and November 5, 2023, as the comet passed behind the Sun.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as it provides insights into the comet during a period when it could not be detected from Earth due to solar glare. The WISPR instrument on the Parker Solar Probe is processing the images to reveal more details about 3I/ATLAS, which reached its closest point to the Sun, or perihelion, on October 29.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The Parker Solar Probe captured around 10 images of 3I/ATLAS per day.</li>
    <li>The comet was approximately 209 million km (130 million miles) from the Sun, just outside the orbit of Mars.</li>
    <li>Parker Solar Probe completed its 25th solar flyby on September 15, 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet became invisible from Earth due to the Sun's glare.</li>
    <li>The WISPR team is processing the images to enhance clarity and remove stray sunlight.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On September 15, 2023, the Parker Solar Probe completed its 25th solar flyby. Between October 18 and November 5, the probe took images of 3I/ATLAS as the comet traveled behind the Sun. The comet reached perihelion on October 29, making it particularly challenging to observe from Earth.</p>

<p>The images taken by the Parker Solar Probe are now being processed to better understand the comet's characteristics during this period of invisibility.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The images offer a valuable look at the comet over a period when it couldn’t be seen from Earth because it appeared too close to the Sun from Earth’s perspective,” the WISPR team stated.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has generated interest among scientists, with some speculating it could be an extraterrestrial probe. The comet's trajectory and behavior have led to discussions about its potential use of gravitational slingshots, particularly when it was hidden behind the Sun.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The WISPR team at NASA will continue processing the images to enhance their quality and extract meaningful data about 3I/ATLAS. Further analysis may provide additional insights into the comet's composition and behavior as it travels through the solar system.</p>
