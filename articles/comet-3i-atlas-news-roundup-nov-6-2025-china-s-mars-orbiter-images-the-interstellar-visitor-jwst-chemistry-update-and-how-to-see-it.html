      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS News Roundup (Nov. 6, 2025)</h2>

<p>On November 6, 2025, China's Tianwen-1 Mars orbiter has released new images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, also known as C/2025 N1, captured during its pass near Mars on October 3 from approximately 30 million kilometers away. The images reveal clear cometary features, marking a significant observation of this interstellar object.</p>

<p>This development is noteworthy as it not only provides valuable data on 3I/ATLAS but also serves as a technology demonstration for China's upcoming Tianwen-2 mission. The observations are expected to enhance understanding of the comet's behavior and composition as it approaches perihelion.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date of images released:</strong> November 6, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Mars during capture:</strong> ~30 million km</li>
    <li><strong>Perihelion date:</strong> October 30, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to Earth:</strong> ~1.8 AU (~270 million km)</li>
    <li><strong>Magnitude at peak brightness:</strong> ~9</li>
    <li><strong>First optical image post-conjunction:</strong> October 31, 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 3, 2025, the Tianwen-1 orbiter captured images of 3I/ATLAS during its flyby near Mars. This event provided a unique opportunity to study the comet's characteristics from a distance similar to that of the European Space Agency’s ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter. Following this, on October 30, 2025, the comet reached perihelion, coming within 1.4 AU of the Sun, just inside Mars' orbit.</p>
<p>On October 31, astronomer Qicheng Zhang recorded the first optical image of 3I/ATLAS after its conjunction, confirming its visibility for ground-based telescopes. A fresh image was published by the Virtual Telescope Project on November 5, marking the beginning of the post-perihelion observing window for amateur astronomers.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Nasa has reiterated that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth, emphasizing its trajectory will not bring it closer than approximately 1.8 AU.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object to be observed, following 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. The comet's name, ATLAS, originates from the survey that first detected it. Observations have shown that the comet has been chemically altered during its journey through the galaxy, with recent analyses indicating a crust enriched in CO₂ due to cosmic-ray exposure.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the comet transitions into the pre-dawn sky, astronomers will continue to monitor its activity. Upcoming observations from JWST and other ground-based facilities are expected to provide further insights into the comet's nucleus size and volatile composition, especially as its venting behavior evolves post-perihelion.</p>
