      <h2>Sky Matters: rogue star wandering the galaxy since before the earth or sun was born gets a temporary comet tail</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has generated a faint cometary tail as it approaches the Sun, marking a brief period of activity in its journey through the solar system. The comet has been frozen solid for most of its existence, but the Sun's warmth has begun to unfreeze some of its gases, including carbon dioxide.</p>

<p>This phenomenon is significant as it provides a glimpse into the life cycle of comets and the effects of solar radiation on these celestial bodies. Astronomers are observing 3I/ATLAS closely during this period of activity before it exits the solar system, where it may remain dormant for potentially billions of years.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS has been frozen solid for most of its journey.</li>
    <li>The Sun's rays have caused some gases to unfreeze, leading to a temporary comet tail.</li>
    <li>This activity is expected to last for a few weeks.</li>
    <li>After this period, 3I/ATLAS will likely return to a frozen state for billions of years.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has spent most of its existence frozen in space. Recent observations indicate that the Sun's warming rays have started to unfreeze some of its gases, resulting in the formation of a faint cometary tail.</p>
<p>This activity is temporary and will last only a few weeks before the comet exits the solar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“For most of its journey, 3I/ATLAS has been frozen solid, but the warming rays of our Sun are enough to unfreeze some of its gases.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable for its long journey through the galaxy, having existed since before the formation of Earth or the Sun. The current activity showcases the dynamic processes that affect comets as they travel through the solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its approach to the Sun, astronomers will monitor its activity closely until it exits the solar system, after which it is expected to return to a dormant state for an extended period.</p>
