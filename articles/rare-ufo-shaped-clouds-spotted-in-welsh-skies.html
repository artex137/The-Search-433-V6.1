      <h2>Rare UFO-shaped clouds spotted in Welsh skies</h2>

<p>Mysterious clouds resembling flying saucers have been spotted in the skies over north Wales last week. The unique formations, known as lenticular clouds, have been observed primarily along Anglesey's south-west coast, captivating onlookers and hikers in the area.</p>

<p>This phenomenon matters as lenticular clouds are uncommon in the UK and can only form under specific weather conditions. The Met Office has explained the science behind these clouds, and their appearance has prompted interest from both the public and meteorologists.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Clouds spotted last week over Anglesey's south-west coast.</li>
    <li>Phenomenon lasted for approximately 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Commonly referred to as pancake clouds due to their flat appearance.</li>
    <li>Seen by hikers in Snowdonia and the Llŷn Peninsula.</li>
    <li>Described as looking like flying saucers, pancakes, and lentils.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Last week, unique lenticular clouds formed over north Wales, particularly visible along the south-west coast of Anglesey. Hikers visiting Traeth Llanddwyn in Newborough reported seeing the clouds as they drifted in from the Pen Llŷn mountains. The clouds appeared suddenly and lasted for about 10 minutes, leaving a lasting impression on those who witnessed them.</p>

<p>Dove Rosalinda, a local hiker, noted her previous encounters with similar clouds, describing the experience as "special" due to their fleeting nature.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>The Met Office stated, "When air blows across a mountain range, in certain circumstances, it can set up a train of large standing waves in the air downstream, rather like ripples forming in a river when water flows over an obstruction. If there is enough moisture in the air, the rising motion of the wave will cause water vapour to condense, forming the unique appearance of lenticular clouds."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Lenticular clouds have been previously mistaken for UFOs due to their unusual shapes. They typically form when stable, moist air travels over mountains, creating standing waves in the atmosphere. These clouds can signify strong winds below and are often avoided by pilots due to the turbulence they can create.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>There are no ongoing investigations related to the cloud formations, but the public and meteorologists will continue to monitor weather conditions that may lead to similar phenomena in the future.</p>
