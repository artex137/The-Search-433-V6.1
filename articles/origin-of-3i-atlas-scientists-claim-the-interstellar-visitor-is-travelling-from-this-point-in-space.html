      <h2>Origin of 3I/ATLAS: Scientists claim the interstellar visitor is travelling from THIS point in space</h2>

<p>Scientists from Shanghai Jiao Tong University have proposed a new theory regarding the origin of interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, indicating it likely comes from the thin disk of the Milky Way, rather than the previously assumed thick disk. The findings were shared on the preprint server arXiv. The research team, led by Yiyang Guo, has analyzed the comet's current orbit and the orbits of nearby stars.</p>

<p>This research is significant as it alters the understanding of the origins of 3I/ATLAS, which is racing towards the inner solar system. The team investigated the gravitational interactions that could have propelled the object into interstellar space, contributing to the ongoing study of interstellar visitors and their trajectories.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is an interstellar object identified as a comet.</li>
    <li>The object is believed to have originated from the thin disk of the Milky Way.</li>
    <li>25 stars passed within 1 parsec (3.26 light-years) of 3I/ATLAS.</li>
    <li>Previous assumptions suggested it came from the thick disk, which contains around 10% of the galaxy’s stars.</li>
    <li>The findings were posted by Yiyang Guo and his team on the preprint server arXiv.</li>
    <li>The coma of 3I/ATLAS contains a high ratio of carbon dioxide to water.</li>
    <li>In late August, the Gemini telescope in Chile observed the comet developing a tail.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Researchers initially believed that 3I/ATLAS originated from the thick disk of the Milky Way. However, Yiyang Guo and his team conducted further analysis of the object's orbit and the orbits of nearby stars.</p>
<p>They identified that 25 stars had passed close enough to potentially slingshot 3I/ATLAS into interstellar space but determined that their relative speeds were too high for this to occur. Subsequently, they shifted their focus to the thin disk of the Milky Way, where they found a higher likelihood of the object’s origin.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Their research changes the earlier view that it originated from among the ancient stars in the Milky Way,” said Yiyang Guo, discussing the implications of the findings.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The coma of 3I/ATLAS is exhibiting strange occurrences, as it contains one of the highest ratios of carbon dioxide to water ever observed in any comet,” noted the research team.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The study of interstellar objects like 3I/ATLAS has gained attention since the discovery of 'Oumuamua in 2017. These objects provide valuable insights into the formation and evolution of solar systems.</p>
<p>The peculiar characteristics of 3I/ATLAS, including its trajectory and composition, have sparked various theories, including the hypothesis that it may have been sent by an alien civilization.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the inner solar system, further analyzing its composition and trajectory to gain a deeper understanding of its origins and the dynamics of interstellar objects.</p>
