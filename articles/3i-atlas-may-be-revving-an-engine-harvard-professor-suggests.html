      <h2>3I/ATLAS may be revving an engine, Harvard professor suggests</h2>

<p>Harvard University professor Avi Loeb has suggested that comet 3I/ATLAS, which is currently approaching Earth, may be exhibiting signs of activity indicative of engine-like propulsion. This claim was made during a recent discussion about the comet's trajectory and behavior as it nears our planet.</p>

<p>This observation is significant because it could change our understanding of comets and their characteristics. Authorities are monitoring 3I/ATLAS closely, as its unusual behavior could have implications for future astronomical research and the study of potentially active celestial objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is approaching Earth.</li>
    <li>Professor Avi Loeb made his comments during a recent discussion.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS may be displaying engine-like propulsion.</li>
    <li>The comet's behavior is being monitored by astronomers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first discovered in 2019. Since then, it has been observed periodically as it travels through the solar system. Recently, Professor Loeb has raised questions about the comet's activity level, suggesting it may not behave like typical comets.</p>

<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches its closest point to Earth, which will occur in the coming weeks, astronomers are preparing to gather more data on its behavior and characteristics.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "The comet may be revving an engine, which would be a groundbreaking observation for our understanding of these celestial bodies."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comets have traditionally been viewed as icy bodies that release gas and dust when they approach the Sun. However, the behavior of 3I/ATLAS raises questions about whether some comets may have more complex dynamics than previously understood. This could lead to new insights into the nature of comets and their formation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it nears Earth, gathering data to confirm or refute Professor Loeb's claims about its potential engine-like activity. Further observations are expected in the coming weeks.</p>
