      <h2>3I/ATLAS may be revving an engine, Harvard professor suggests</h2>

<p>A Harvard professor has suggested that Comet 3I/ATLAS may be exhibiting signs of an engine-like propulsion as it approaches Earth. This claim has emerged from recent observations made by astronomers studying the comet, which is currently traveling through the inner solar system.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it could alter our understanding of comet behavior and dynamics. Astronomers and space agencies are closely monitoring 3I/ATLAS to gather more data on its trajectory and characteristics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is currently in the inner solar system.</li>
  <li>Observations have indicated potential engine-like propulsion.</li>
  <li>Harvard professor has noted the unusual behavior of the comet.</li>
  <li>Further studies are underway to analyze the comet's dynamics.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Recent observations of Comet 3I/ATLAS have indicated its unusual behavior, leading to the suggestion of engine-like propulsion. This has prompted astronomers to investigate the comet more closely to understand the implications of these findings.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
  “The behavior of Comet 3I/ATLAS is unlike what we typically observe in comets," the Harvard professor stated. "This could change how we understand comet propulsion.”
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comets are generally known for their icy compositions and tails that form when they approach the sun. The behavior of 3I/ATLAS may represent a new category of cometary activity, warranting further investigation by the scientific community.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to monitor Comet 3I/ATLAS to gather more data and confirm the findings regarding its propulsion. Further research is expected to provide clarity on the comet's behavior and its implications for future studies.</p>
