      <h2>UFO Disclosure Sparks Warnings from Researchers</h2>

<p>Author and researcher L.A. Marzulli has stated that the recent mainstream attention to UFOs represents a significant cultural shift, with implications for faith and belief systems. During an interview with Charisma Media, Marzulli emphasized that this shift is not accidental and suggests prophetic times are approaching. He noted that whistleblowers have emerged, and Congress is discussing the Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP)/UFO phenomenon.</p>

<p>This development matters as it challenges traditional views on extraterrestrial life and raises concerns about spiritual deception. Marzulli argues that the apparent normalization of UFO discussions may lead many to abandon their faith in favor of new narratives regarding humanity's place in the universe.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>L.A. Marzulli has investigated UFOs and related phenomena for over 30 years.</li>
    <li>He cited biblical warnings from 1 Timothy 4:1 regarding spiritual deception.</li>
    <li>Marzulli believes a coordinated global disclosure could prompt a "falling away" from faith.</li>
    <li>He warns that the church must engage with these issues actively.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>For decades, UFOs were largely considered fringe topics, confined to late-night radio and obscure documentaries. Recently, discussions around UFOs have gained traction in mainstream media, with Congress addressing the UAP phenomenon. Marzulli highlights this shift as a warning sign, suggesting that the convergence of these discussions is leading toward a significant moment of global disclosure.</p>

<p>Marzulli connects this to biblical teachings, suggesting that the rise in UFO discourse is part of a larger spiritual battle between faith and deception. He calls for believers to prepare themselves to respond to this phenomenon with biblical insights.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Everything is in lock step. Congress is talking about the UAP/UFO phenomenon. Whistleblowers are coming forward… All these people say the same thing: We are not alone in the universe.” 
    <strong>- L.A. Marzulli</strong>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “The phenomenon is now out of the back room. It’s no longer [a] conspiracy theory. And what’s alarming to me is the slumber of the church.” 
    <strong>- L.A. Marzulli</strong>
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The recent increase in UFO sightings and discussions has led to a growing acceptance of the topic in mainstream culture. Marzulli argues that this trend is not just about technology but is fundamentally theological. He believes that the church must be prepared to address these issues as they arise, emphasizing the importance of grounding beliefs in Scripture.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Marzulli and other researchers are urging pastors and believers to engage with the UFO phenomenon now. They stress the importance of being prepared to discuss these developments in light of biblical teachings, as the cultural landscape continues to evolve rapidly.</p>
