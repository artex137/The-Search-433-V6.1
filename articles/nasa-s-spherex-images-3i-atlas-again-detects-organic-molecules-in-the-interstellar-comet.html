      <h2>NASA’s SPHEREx Images 3I/ATLAS Again, Detects Organic Molecules in the Interstellar Comet</h2>

<p>In December 2025, NASA’s SPHEREx mission captured new images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS using its infrared devices, revealing the presence of organic molecules such as methanol, cyanide, and methane. The comet was discovered by the NASA-funded ATLAS (Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System) survey telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile, and reported to the Minor Planet Center on July 1, 2025.</p>

<p>This discovery adds to the growing understanding of 3I/ATLAS as it continues to pass through the solar system. Researchers have noted that the comet's increase in brightness correlates with the release of various gases, which may provide insights into the early solar system's materials.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovery date:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to the Sun:</strong> October 30, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Significant brightness increase observed:</strong> December 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Organic molecules detected:</strong> Methanol, cyanide, methane</li>
    <li><strong>Notable institution:</strong> Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile. The comet made its closest approach to the Sun on October 30, 2025. In December 2025, SPHEREx conducted observations that revealed the presence of organic molecules and a significant increase in brightness due to gas emissions.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Comet 3I/ATLAS was full-on erupting into space in December 2025, after its close flyby of the Sun, causing it to significantly brighten,” said Carey Lisse, study lead at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The comet has spent ages traversing interstellar space, being bombarded by highly energetic cosmic rays, and has likely formed a crust that’s been processed by that radiation,” said Phil Kornguth, the mission’s instrument scientist at Caltech.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object to be observed in our solar system. Its study provides valuable information about the composition of celestial bodies and the conditions of the early solar system. The detection of organic molecules in comets is significant as it suggests the potential for carbon-rich materials that may have influenced planetary formation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze data from SPHEREx and monitor 3I/ATLAS’s activity as it travels through the solar system. Further studies may yield more insights into the comet's composition and its implications for understanding the history of our solar system.</p>
