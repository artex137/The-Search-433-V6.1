      <h2>'Alien spaceship' 3I/ATLAS spotted emitting 'building blocks of life' by NASA</h2>

<p>The comet 3I/ATLAS has been detected emitting organic molecules by a NASA telescope during its closest approach to Earth in December 2025. The NASA SPHEREX telescope observed substances including methanol, cyanide, and methane coming from the comet, which has been referred to as an "alien spaceship" by Harvard Professor Avi Loeb.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it provides more evidence for Loeb's argument that 3I/ATLAS could be a satellite from an alien planet. However, NASA has clarified that while the emitted materials are essential for biological processes on Earth, they can also arise from non-biological processes in space, indicating that the presence of these molecules does not confirm extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was closest to Earth in December 2025.</li>
    <li>NASA SPHEREX telescope detected organic molecules including methanol, cyanide, and methane.</li>
    <li>The comet experienced a notable increase in brightness two months after its flyby of the Sun.</li>
    <li>Carey Lisse, a NASA scientist, described the comet as "full-on erupting into space."</li>
    <li>Approximately one-third of a comet's bulk is water ice, which sublimates into gas upon heating.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In December 2025, comet 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to Earth, during which it was observed by the NASA SPHEREX telescope. The telescope detected various organic molecules being emitted from the comet. Following this event, the comet's brightness significantly increased as it approached the Sun, leading to the release of carbon-rich material.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Comet 3I/ATLAS was full-on erupting into space in December 2025, after its close flyby of the Sun, causing it to significantly brighten,” said NASA scientist Carey Lisse.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The consequences, should the hypothesis turn out to be correct, could potentially be dire for humanity, and would possibly require defensive measures to be undertaken,” noted a scientific paper co-authored by Professor Loeb.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This discovery builds on previous assertions by Professor Loeb, who has raised concerns about the potential for 3I/ATLAS to be a hostile spacecraft. His earlier paper suggested that humanity should prepare for possible defensive actions if the object were confirmed to be a spacecraft.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>No further investigations or actions have been disclosed at this time regarding the implications of the findings related to 3I/ATLAS.</p>
