      <h2>Rare interstellar comet spotted for only the third time in recorded history</h2>

<p>Scientists using the James Webb telescope have identified an interstellar comet, designated 3I/Atlas, for the first time in images, marking only the third such sighting in history. The comet is currently travelling towards the sun at speeds of 130,000 miles per hour and was first discovered in July 2023.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it provides insight into celestial bodies outside our solar system. The James Webb telescope's advanced near-infrared technology has enabled researchers to capture detailed data about 3I/Atlas, prompting further studies to understand its origins and characteristics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas was discovered in July 2023.</li>
    <li>It is travelling at speeds of 130,000 mph.</li>
    <li>The estimated size of the comet is approximately 3.5 miles wide.</li>
    <li>The comet is believed to be around 3 billion years older than our solar system.</li>
    <li>It is emitting large chunks of mixed CO2 and H2O ice into its atmosphere.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2023, astronomers first discovered comet 3I/Atlas. Following its discovery, scientists have utilized the James Webb telescope to gather images and data about the comet. The telescope's near-infrared technology has allowed for the analysis of the comet’s physical properties, leading to new insights about its composition and speed.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The comet is travelling in an unusually flat and straight line, which is what gives it its extreme speed,” a team member explained. 
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “We concluded that 3I/Atlas is emitting large chunks of mixed CO2 and H2O ice into its immediate atmosphere,” another researcher noted, emphasizing the unique atmospheric conditions surrounding the comet.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This sighting of 3I/Atlas adds to the limited number of interstellar comets observed by scientists. Prior to this, only two interstellar comets have been recorded, underscoring the rarity and significance of this discovery. The unique characteristics of 3I/Atlas, such as its extreme speed and size, contribute to ongoing research into the formation and evolution of celestial bodies beyond our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to study comet 3I/Atlas to gain further insights into its origin and composition as it approaches the sun. The data collected will contribute to a broader understanding of interstellar objects and their impact on our knowledge of the universe.</p>
