      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS reveals weird wobbling jets in rare sun-facing tail</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has shown surprising jet structures in its sun-facing "anti-tail" as it moves away from Earth, according to research published on arXiv. The comet, which is currently heading out of the solar system, exhibited wobbling jets every 7 hours and 45 minutes as it approached the sun.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it provides scientists with a rare opportunity to study the physical behavior of a pristine body formed in another planetary system. The research team observed the comet over 37 nights between July 2 and September 5, 2025, using the Two-meter Twin Telescope at the Teide Observatory in the Canary Islands.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is currently moving out of the solar system.</li>
    <li>The research spanned from July 2 to September 5, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet made its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, coming within approximately 270 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>The anti-tail of the comet stretches up to 1 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>The wobbling jets appeared on 7 nights between August 3 and August 29, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet is only the third known object from another star to enter our solar system.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 2, 2025, researchers began their observations of comet 3I/ATLAS. The study continued until September 5, 2025, during which the team documented the evolution of the comet's coma. On August 3, 2025, the first signs of wobbling jets appeared in the anti-tail, and these jets were observed until August 29, 2025. The comet made its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of approximately 270 million kilometers from the planet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Characterizing jets in 3I thus represents a rare opportunity to investigate the physical behavior of a pristine body formed in another planetary system,” the researchers stated in their paper.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable for being only the third interstellar object detected in our solar system, following 'Oumuamua in October 2017 and 2I/Borisov in August 2019. While sun-facing anti-tails have been observed in comets originating from our solar system, this is the first time such a phenomenon has been documented in an interstellar comet.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As comet 3I/ATLAS continues its journey out of the solar system, researchers will analyze the data collected from their observations to better understand the comet's characteristics and behavior.</p>
