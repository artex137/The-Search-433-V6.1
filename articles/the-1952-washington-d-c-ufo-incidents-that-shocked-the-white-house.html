      <h2>The 1952 Washington D.C. UFO Incidents That Shocked the White House</h2>

<p>In July 1952, Washington, D.C. experienced a series of unexplained aerial phenomena that prompted significant concern from the U.S. government. Over two weekends, radar systems at Washington National Airport and Andrews Air Force Base detected multiple unidentified objects, alarming officials at the White House. No injuries or fatalities were reported during these incidents.</p>

<p>The events have garnered attention due to their implications for national security and public perception of UFOs. Authorities, including the Air Force and CIA, have worked to address the growing number of UFO reports, fearing public panic. The incidents led to the establishment of the 1953 Robertson Panel to further investigate the phenomena.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Incident dates: July 19-20 and July 26-27, 1952</li>
    <li>Location: Washington, D.C., specifically Washington National Airport and Andrews Air Force Base</li>
    <li>Radar detections: Multiple unidentified objects observed</li>
    <li>Response: F-94 jet fighters scrambled to intercept the objects</li>
    <li>Official explanation: Attributed to temperature inversions and misidentifications</li>
    <li>Follow-up: Formation of the 1953 Robertson Panel</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On the night of July 19, air traffic controllers at Washington National Airport detected several objects on radar that did not follow established flight paths. These objects exhibited speeds and maneuvering unlike conventional aircraft. Radar echoes appeared near the White House and U.S. Capitol, with visual reports describing “orange-red fireballs” and “tailless, fast-moving white lights.”</p>

<p>Following this, the Air Force scrambled F-94 jets to intercept the objects. Remarkably, the radar targets vanished when the jets entered the area, only to reappear after the aircraft withdrew.</p>

<p>A similar situation occurred on July 26, with radar centers detecting unidentified objects across all sectors. Fighter pilots reported seeing white points of light, but they could not close in on them. The radar anomalies continued until just before dawn.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The phenomena were attributed to temperature inversions causing false radar returns, combined with misidentifications of celestial bodies, meteors, and man-made lights,” the Air Force said in a press conference on July 29.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>These incidents follow an earlier UFO sighting in June 1947 near Maury Island in Washington State, where a timber salvage worker claimed to have seen six donut-shaped flying objects. This sighting, despite later being recanted, contributed to the folklore surrounding UFOs and the “Men in Black” legend.</p>

<p>Since then, Washington State has continued to report sporadic UFO sightings, including a 2020 encounter near Joint Base Lewis–McChord, which remains unexplained.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the 1952 incidents have led to ongoing discussions about UFOs and their implications for national security. The Robertson Panel continues to influence how authorities address unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>
