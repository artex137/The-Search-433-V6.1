      <h2>Former DIA Scientist Says US Is Studying a 'Non-Human' Craft That Can Fly Without Fuel</h2>

<p>A former Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA) scientist has stated that the United States has been studying a 'non-human' craft that appears to fly without any visible fuel source. This research has been taking place in near-total secrecy in Las Vegas, according to Dr. James Lacatski, who led the largest UFO investigation funded by the US government.</p>

<p>This revelation highlights ongoing efforts by authorities to understand advanced aerial technologies that could have significant implications for national security. The programme aims not only to catalogue sightings but also to replicate the propulsion systems of these unidentified objects, which have been reported for decades.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Research conducted by the Advanced Aerospace Weapon System Applications Program (AAWSAP)</li>
    <li>Funding of £18m ($22m) from the US government</li>
    <li>Duration of operation: just over two years</li>
    <li>More than 116 technical reports produced</li>
    <li>Research team included around 50 full-time investigators</li>
    <li>Dr. Lacatski's new book: <em>Inside the US Government Covert UFO Program: New Insights</em></li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Dr. Lacatski has indicated that the investigation into unidentified aerial phenomena began after he reviewed reports from Skinwalker Ranch in Utah, a site known for unexplained sightings. He visited the ranch with its owner, aerospace entrepreneur Robert Bigelow, where he experienced a 'direct encounter' that spurred him to pursue further investigation.</p>
<p>The AAWSAP operated for just over two years, producing extensive documentation on UFO phenomena. Despite the findings, the Pentagon has not released the full archive, and much of the material remains undisclosed fourteen years later.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We wanted to learn what could be weaponised,” Dr. Lacatski stated, emphasizing the national security implications of such technology.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The mission was straightforward: understand the technology behind unidentified craft to outperform known human aviation by a massive margin,” Dr. Lacatski added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The AAWSAP is noted for being one of the most extensive investigations acknowledged by the US government regarding UFOs. The programme's funding was championed by former Nevada Senator Harry Reid, who warned that it was crucial for the US to be the first to understand such technology to maintain a strategic advantage over rivals like China and Russia.</p>
<p>Despite the significant findings, the Pentagon has been reluctant to disclose information, leaving much of the research inaccessible to the public.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Dr. Lacatski plans to release more information through his upcoming book, which he states contains material from official sources collected with government funding. The future of investigations into unidentified aerial phenomena remains uncertain, with no timeline for the public release of the full archive from the AAWSAP.</p>
