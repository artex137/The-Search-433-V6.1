      <h2>Non-Gravitational Acceleration of Comet 3I/ATLAS Sparks Debate on Its Nature</h2>

<p>Recent observations of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS have raised questions about its behavior and composition. Data from the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) indicated that the comet was off its expected trajectory by four arcseconds in Right Ascension on October 29, 2025. This deviation suggests a non-gravitational acceleration occurring near its perihelion. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as it may indicate a loss of mass from the comet, which has implications for its composition and behavior. Authorities, including the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN), will monitor 3I/ATLAS closely in the coming months to gather more data and assess the situation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS deviated from its expected trajectory by four arcseconds on October 29, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet has lost an estimated 16% of its mass during its close approach to the Sun.</li>
    <li>Current mass of 3I/ATLAS is approximately 33 billion tons.</li>
    <li>A gas cloud surrounding the comet is estimated to weigh more than 5.5 billion tons.</li>
    <li>The comet will reach its closest point to Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of 269 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>Monitoring by ground-based telescopes and space telescopes, including Hubble and Webb, will occur during its approach.</li>
    <li>IAWN will observe the comet from November 27, 2025, to January 27, 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 29, 2025, ALMA data revealed that comet 3I/ATLAS was off its expected trajectory, indicating potential non-gravitational acceleration.</p>
<p>The comet's mass loss of at least 16% has been calculated, suggesting significant material shedding during its close approach to the Sun.</p>
<p>3I/ATLAS will come closest to Earth on December 19, 2025, prompting extensive monitoring by various astronomical agencies.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS is undoubtedly a natural comet,” said prominent science communicator Brian Cox. “However, some researchers argue that more evidence is needed to support this conclusion.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The situation with 3I/ATLAS echoes earlier observations of 1I/`Oumuamua, the first known interstellar object, which also exhibited non-gravitational acceleration without detectable gas or dust. This has sparked ongoing discussions within the scientific community about the nature of such objects.</p>
<p>Critics emphasize the need for empirical data to clarify the true nature of 3I/ATLAS, as the debate continues over whether it is a natural comet or possibly something more exotic.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Ongoing investigations will determine whether the behavior of 3I/ATLAS can be explained through conventional astrophysical models or if it will lead to new revelations about technological signatures in our solar system.</p>
