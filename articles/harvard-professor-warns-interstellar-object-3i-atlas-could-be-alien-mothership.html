      <h2>Harvard Professor Warns Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS Could Be Alien ‘Mothership’</h2>

<p>A Harvard scientist has raised concerns about the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, suggesting it may be an alien spacecraft approaching Earth. The claim has ignited debate among astronomers, while NASA maintains that the object is a natural comet.</p>

<p>The object, discovered on July 1 by the ATLAS telescope in Chile, is only the third known visitor from outside the solar system. It is expected to pass close to Mars, Jupiter, and Venus in the coming months, although it will remain 170 million miles from Earth at its closest approach.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Discovered by:</strong> ATLAS telescope, Chile</li>
    <li><strong>Size Estimate:</strong> 3.5 miles (NASA), up to 12 miles (Avi Loeb)</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Approximately 209,000 km/h (130,000 mph)</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to Earth:</strong> Between November 21 and December 5, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance at Closest Approach:</strong> 170 million miles</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the ATLAS telescope in Chile first detects 3I/ATLAS. The object, traveling at high speed, is noted for its unusual trajectory. In September, Professor Avi Loeb raises alarms about its potential as an alien mothership, citing its size and retrograde orbit as significant. NASA, however, uses Hubble Space Telescope data to classify it as a comet, asserting it poses no threat to Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It could come to save us or to destroy us. We’d better be prepared for both possibilities and verify that all interstellar objects are just rocks.” — Professor Avi Loeb</blockquote>
<blockquote>“All data point to a comet. Hubble imagery shows 3I/ATLAS behaving in ways typical of icy bodies heated by the Sun.” — Tom Statler, NASA lead scientist for small bodies</blockquote>
<blockquote>“This suggestion is absolute nonsense and an insult to the exciting work that is being done to understand this object.” — Chris Lintott, Oxford astrophysicist</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object discovered, following 'Oumuamua in 2017 and comet 2I/Borisov in 2019. These discoveries have prompted discussions among scientists regarding the potential for extraterrestrial technology and the need for monitoring such objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Loeb has called for governments to assess interstellar objects as possible risks and suggested using NASA's Juno spacecraft to study 3I/ATLAS as it nears Jupiter. NASA continues to monitor the object, maintaining that it poses no danger to Earth.</p>
