      <h2>The Bigfoot and UFOs Podcast Introducing Listeners to Christ</h2>

<p>Lukas Rogers and Nathan Henry, co-hosts of the podcast <em>Blurry Creatures</em>, have launched a platform that explores paranormal topics from a Christian perspective. The podcast has gained traction since its inception in 2019, focusing on themes such as Bigfoot, UFOs, and biblical supernatural stories. Their mission is to create a space for listeners to engage with the unexplained while encountering Christian faith.</p>

<p>The podcast addresses a gap in discussions about paranormal phenomena within Christian communities. Rogers and Henry aim to provide a theological framework for understanding these experiences, inviting listeners to consider the supernatural aspects of their faith. They have interviewed experts and shared personal stories, seeking to foster a deeper understanding of these topics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Podcast launched in 2019</li>
    <li>Focus on paranormal topics, including Bigfoot and UFOs</li>
    <li>Hosts Lukas Rogers and Nathan Henry have backgrounds in Christianity</li>
    <li>Initial episode centered on Bigfoot</li>
    <li>More than 30 episodes produced</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The <em>Blurry Creatures</em> podcast began in 2019, with its first episode focusing on Bigfoot. This topic was chosen as a familiar entry point for listeners. Over the years, the hosts have expanded their discussions to include various unexplained phenomena and biblical references. They have featured numerous guests, including experts in the field of paranormal studies, to provide insights and encourage deeper conversations.</p>

<p>As the podcast gained popularity, the hosts developed a more structured approach, creating a website and establishing a platform for listener engagement. This growth has allowed them to explore more complex topics while maintaining their core mission of connecting faith with the supernatural.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Our mission is really to find better answers for the unexplained and to do that through a biblical perspective,” said Rogers.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“What we’ve found is over the years that people of all walks of life have a story or three... and they’ve found there aren’t many people they can talk to about these things, especially in the church,” Henry noted.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to the launch of <em>Blurry Creatures</em>, discussions surrounding paranormal phenomena were often absent in Christian circles. The podcast seeks to address this gap, offering a unique blend of theology and contemporary issues. The rise of interest in cryptids and UFOs in mainstream media has also contributed to the relevance of the podcast's themes.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Rogers and Henry plan to continue expanding their podcast by exploring new topics and inviting more experts. They aim to deepen their discussions on the intersection of faith and the supernatural, encouraging listeners to engage with their own experiences and beliefs.</p>
