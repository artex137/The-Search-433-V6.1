      <h2>Mysterious Comet C/2025 R2 (SWAN) Discovered</h2>

<p>Comet C/2025 R2, commonly known as Comet SWAN R2, was discovered by amateur astronomer Vladimir Bezugly on 11 September 2025 using data from the SWAN instrument aboard the SOHO spacecraft. The comet reached perihelion, its closest point to the Sun, on 12 September 2025, at approximately 0.5 AU (75 million km) from the Sun. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with the discovery.</p>

<p>The discovery of Comet SWAN R2 is significant as it marks the 20th comet identified through the SWAN instrument. Authorities and astronomers are now investigating its trajectory and origin to determine whether it is an Oort Cloud comet or an interstellar object. Initial analyses suggest it is likely a long-period comet from our solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date of discovery:</strong> 11 September 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Perihelion date:</strong> 12 September 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance at perihelion:</strong> ~0.5 AU (75 million km)</li>
    <li><strong>Estimated orbital period:</strong> ~22,000 years</li>
    <li><strong>Brightness at discovery:</strong> Magnitude +7 to +6</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to Earth:</strong> 19–20 October 2025 at ~0.26 AU (39 million km)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 11 September 2025, Vladimir Bezugly discovered Comet SWAN R2 while analyzing data from the SWAN instrument aboard the SOHO spacecraft. The comet was confirmed shortly after its discovery, earning the provisional label “SWAN25B.” It reached perihelion on 12 September 2025, and it became visible to observers in the Southern Hemisphere shortly thereafter.</p>

<p>As the comet moved northward, it began to brighten, becoming accessible to mid-latitude observers. It is expected to reach a peak brightness of magnitude +4 to +5 in October 2025, potentially allowing it to be seen with the naked eye.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This is a milestone, the 20th official SWAN comet so far,” said Vladimir Bezugly, highlighting the importance of the discovery.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of Comet SWAN R2 follows the identification of 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1), the third confirmed interstellar comet found in July 2025. This context adds intrigue to the investigation of SWAN R2's origins, as its unusual orbit initially raised questions about its potential interstellar nature. However, further data suggests it is likely a long-period comet from the solar system’s Oort Cloud.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to monitor Comet SWAN R2 as it approaches Earth in October 2025. They will analyze its trajectory and brightness to gather more information about its origins and characteristics. The potential for a meteor shower from cometary debris around 5 October 2025 will also be observed closely by skywatchers.</p>
