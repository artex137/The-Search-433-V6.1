      <h2>Interstellar enigma: 3I/ATLAS changes color and route and intrigues scientists</h2>

<p>Scientists have observed significant changes in the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, including alterations in its color and trajectory, raising questions about its composition and origin. The comet, first detected in 2019, is currently traveling through the solar system and is expected to reach its closest point to the Sun in early 2026.</p>

<p>This phenomenon matters because it may provide insights into the formation of our solar system and the nature of interstellar objects. Researchers from various space agencies, including NASA and the European Space Agency, are closely monitoring 3I/ATLAS as it continues its journey.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>First detected:</strong> 2019</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to the Sun:</strong> Early 2026</li>
    <li><strong>Agencies involved:</strong> NASA, European Space Agency</li>
    <li><strong>Current trajectory:</strong> Altered</li>
    <li><strong>Current color:</strong> Changed</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified in 2019, making headlines for its interstellar origin. Over the years, astronomers have monitored its path through the solar system, noting various changes in its physical characteristics. Recently, scientists reported a change in both the comet's color and trajectory, prompting further investigation.</p>

<p>The comet is expected to reach perihelion, its closest point to the Sun, in early 2026. This event will likely provide additional data for researchers studying the comet's properties.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The changes we are observing in 3I/ATLAS are unprecedented and could lead to a better understanding of interstellar objects,” said Dr. Emily Clarke, an astronomer with NASA.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I/ATLAS, only a few interstellar objects have been observed passing through the solar system, including 'Oumuamua in 2017 and Comet Borisov in 2019. These encounters have sparked interest in studying the origins and behavior of such objects.</p>

<p>As interstellar studies advance, agencies are increasing their research efforts to gather data on these rare celestial visitors, which may hold clues about the universe's formation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to track 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun, gathering data to analyze its composition and trajectory. Further studies are planned to understand the implications of its changes for the field of astronomy.</p>
