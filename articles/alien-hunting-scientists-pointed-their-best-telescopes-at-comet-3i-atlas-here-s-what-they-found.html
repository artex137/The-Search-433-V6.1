      <h2>Alien-hunting scientists pointed their best telescopes at comet 3I/ATLAS. Here's what they found</h2>

<p>Scientists have conducted extensive observations of comet 3I/ATLAS since its discovery on 1 July 2025. This interstellar comet, which originated from beyond the Solar System, has captured the attention of the scientific community and the public alike. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in relation to the comet.</p>

<p>The significance of 3I/ATLAS lies in its rarity as one of only three comets known to have formed outside the Solar System. While some have speculated about the possibility of it being an alien spacecraft, the majority of astronomers continue to classify it as a natural comet. The Breakthrough Listen project has led efforts to search for signs of extraterrestrial technology associated with 3I/ATLAS, using a network of radio telescopes to investigate the comet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered on 1 July 2025.</li>
    <li>Breakthrough Listen project began observations shortly after the comet's discovery.</li>
    <li>Observations included the Allen Telescope Array, MeerKAT, Vera C. Rubin Observatory, Green Bank Telescope, and Parkes Observatory.</li>
    <li>Breakthrough Listen reported no evidence of technosignatures from 3I/ATLAS.</li>
    <li>Observations continued through the comet's closest approach to Earth on 19 December 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 1 July 2025, comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered. Following its discovery, the Breakthrough Listen project and its collaborators initiated observations using various telescopes. The Allen Telescope Array conducted its first observations in early July 2025. The MeerKAT telescope detected hydroxyl signatures in October 2025, indicating the presence of water ice. Observations from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory confirmed the comet's typical behaviour.</p>
<p>On 18 December 2025, the Green Bank Telescope conducted its observations, searching for artificial signals just before the comet's closest approach to Earth the following day. The Parkes Observatory recorded data on 3I/ATLAS on 31 July, 12 September, and 5 October, although results from these observations have not yet been disclosed.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We did not find any signals worthy of additional follow-up,” the Breakthrough Listen paper states, noting that no engineered radio signals were detected from 3I/ATLAS.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“MeerKAT observations confirm that 3I/ATLAS is acting as a comet and do not detect signals from it of technological origin,” said a statement from the MeerKAT team.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“We’re happy that we are contributing, alongside colleagues around the world, to a fuller understanding of this remarkable natural phenomenon,” said Fernando Camilo, chief scientist at the South African Radio Astronomy Observatory.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“No technosignatures have been detected in any of these searches. 3I/ATLAS continues to behave as expected from natural astrophysical processes,” the Breakthrough Listen Initiative concluded.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is significant as one of the few known interstellar comets. The scientific community has observed similar objects in the past, but the rarity of such comets makes 3I/ATLAS a unique subject of study. The Breakthrough Listen project aims to search for evidence of extraterrestrial life through advanced observations of celestial objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The Breakthrough Listen Initiative plans to continue monitoring 3I/ATLAS as part of its broader strategy to investigate interstellar objects. Further observations will seek to deepen the understanding of such rare phenomena in the cosmos.</p>
