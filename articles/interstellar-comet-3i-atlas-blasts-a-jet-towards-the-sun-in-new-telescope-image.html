      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS blasts a jet towards the sun in new telescope image</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has been observed jetting off ice and dust into space as it approaches the sun for its closest encounter on October 30. The comet is currently about 1.8 astronomical units from Earth, making it visible to amateur astronomers using small telescopes.</p>

<p>This behavior is significant as it mirrors typical comet activity seen in our solar system. Authorities, including astronomers and researchers, are closely monitoring the comet's trajectory and activity, utilizing various telescopes to gather data.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is approaching the sun for a closest approach on October 30.</li>
    <li>The comet is currently 1.8 astronomical units from Earth.</li>
    <li>The jet is estimated to extend approximately 6,200 miles (10,000 km) from the comet's surface.</li>
    <li>Footage of the jet was captured on August 2 using the Two-meter Twin Telescope at Teide Observatory in Tenerife, Canary Islands.</li>
    <li>Astronomers reported the jet activity on October 15 via the Astronomer's Telegram.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On August 2, astronomers captured footage of the jet emitted by comet 3I/ATLAS, which was later processed to create a composite image.</p>
<p>On October 15, the activity of the jet was reported in the Astronomer's Telegram, informing the astronomy community about the comet's behavior.</p>
<p>As of now, the comet is on a trajectory towards its closest approach to the sun, expected on October 30.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Miquel Serra-Ricart, astrophysicist and chief science officer at Light Bridges, stated, "This is the usual," regarding the comet's jetting behavior.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third known interstellar object to pass through our solar system. Its behavior is consistent with what has been observed in other comets, such as C/2020 F3 NEOWISE, which exhibited similar jetting when it approached the sun in 2020.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the sun, gathering data on its activity and composition. Further observations are expected to occur during its closest approach on October 30.</p>
