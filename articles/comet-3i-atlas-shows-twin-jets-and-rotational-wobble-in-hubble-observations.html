      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS shows twin jets and rotational wobble in Hubble observations</h2>

<p>The Hubble Space Telescope has captured images of comet 3I/ATLAS, the third known interstellar object to enter the solar system, on December 12 and 27, 2025. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it reveals the comet's internal activity and emission patterns, helping scientists understand the behaviour of interstellar objects under solar influence. Researchers are analysing the data for insights into the comet's composition and structure as it moves away from the Sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was observed on December 12 and 27, 2025.</li>
    <li>It is the third known interstellar object to enter the solar system.</li>
    <li>The comet displayed twin jets of material, one directed towards the Sun and a weaker one in the opposite direction.</li>
    <li>A 7-degree wobble around the comet’s rotation axis has been noted.</li>
    <li>The comet reached perihelion on October 29, 2025.</li>
    <li>The Sun's gravitational pull deflected the comet by 16 degrees at perihelion.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS entered the solar system and was first detected as it approached the Sun. Observations on December 12 and 27, 2025, revealed its twin jets, suggesting an organised internal process related to its rotation. The comet reached perihelion on October 29, 2025, during which it experienced a 16-degree deflection due to the Sun's gravity.</p>

<p>As the comet continues its journey, the jets indicate ongoing activity and a relationship between its rotation and jet emission.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The twin jets suggest a highly organised process related to rotation,” said Harvard physicist Avi Loeb. “The gravitational effects on 3I/ATLAS during its solar encounter provide valuable information.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The observations of comet 3I/ATLAS contribute to a growing body of research on interstellar objects. Previous studies have focused on the behaviour and characteristics of such comets, helping scientists refine models of their activity as they interact with solar forces.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to analyse data from Hubble as 3I/ATLAS fades from view. Future studies aim to uncover more about the comet's composition and internal processes as it moves outward into deep space.</p>
