      <h2>NASA spacecraft record interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS reaching peak brightness near the Sun</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has brightened significantly as it approaches perihelion, its closest point to the Sun, on 30 October 2025. NASA and international spacecraft have tracked the comet's journey, although it is currently hidden from Earth’s view.</p>

<p>The observation of comet 3I/ATLAS is significant for scientists studying interstellar objects. As the comet interacts with solar heat and radiation, researchers aim to learn about its composition and the origins of comets from distant star systems.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS reached perihelion on 30 October 2025.</li>
    <li>NASA, NOAA, and the European Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) are involved in monitoring the comet.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS has been recorded to brighten sharply, with a magnitude of around 11.</li>
    <li>NASA predicts the comet will reappear in early December 2025.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS may be up to 5.6 kilometres wide, potentially the largest interstellar object detected.</li>
    <li>The comet is estimated to be around 7.6 billion years old.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 18 October 2025, amateur astronomer Worachate Boonplod detected comet 3I/ATLAS using NOAA’s GOES-19 satellite. The comet was visible until 24 October as it moved across the solar field. NASA’s PUNCH mission and SOHO also monitored the comet until 26 October.</p>

<p>On 28 October, a study by Qicheng Zhang and Karl Battams reported the comet's rapid increase in brightness as it neared the Sun. The comet's brightening was attributed to gas emissions from its surface ices sublimating under solar heat.</p>

<p>NASA anticipates that 3I/ATLAS will become visible again in early December 2025 as it moves away from the Sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “This brightening was significant for astronomers tracking its evolution,” said Qicheng Zhang, co-author of the study published on arXiv.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “Every image captured by NASA’s and ESA’s solar observatories deepens our understanding of the dynamic environment beyond our solar neighbourhood,” said Karl Battams, co-author of the study.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar comet discovered. Its extreme velocity suggests it has traveled through space for billions of years, shaped by gravitational interactions with stars and nebulae. This comet represents a unique opportunity to study interstellar material and its evolution.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following its reappearance in December, NASA plans to continue monitoring comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Jupiter in March 2026, which may provide further insights into its characteristics and the nature of interstellar comets.</p>
