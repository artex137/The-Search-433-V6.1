      <h2>3I/ATLAS Makes Historic Earth Pass, Reveals Twin Tails In First-Ever Close-Up Of Interstellar Comet</h2>

<p>Astronomers have photographed interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it made its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025. The comet, which shines brightly in the sky, features two distinct tails stretching out into space, as captured in an image taken at a remote observatory in Utah. There were no injuries or fatalities reported.</p>

<p>This historic event is significant as 3I/ATLAS is only the third known interstellar object observed passing through the Solar System, following ‘Oumuamua in 2017 and comet Borisov in 2019. NASA’s Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) identified the comet earlier this year. Its close approach has provided a unique opportunity for scientists to study its composition and origins, which may offer insights into the formation of comets and planets in other star systems.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Closest approach occurred on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet passed Earth at a distance of about 270 million kilometres (approximately 18 astronomical units).</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is moving at a speed of nearly 68 kilometres per second.</li>
    <li>The comet reached perihelion on October 29, 2025, at a distance of 136 astronomical units from the Sun.</li>
    <li>The image was produced using a PlaneWave Delta Rho 500 telescope and a high-resolution ZWO camera.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will have its next significant encounter near Jupiter in March 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified by NASA’s ATLAS earlier in 2025. It reached its closest point to the Sun, known as perihelion, on October 29, 2025. The comet's closest approach to Earth occurred on December 19, 2025, marking a key moment for astronomers and observers. After this flyby, 3I/ATLAS is set to continue on an outward trajectory, with a future encounter near Jupiter planned for March 2026.</p>

<p>The image of the comet was captured using a stacking technique that totaled 74 minutes of exposure time. This method revealed a bright active coma surrounding the nucleus, along with a straight ion tail and a dust tail.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“At no point did the object pose any threat,” NASA clarified regarding the comet's approach.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The observations that can be made during its brief passage by our planet will take years to analyse,” said Dr. Sebastian Voltmer, who shared the image.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object to be observed in the Solar System. Its predecessors, ‘Oumuamua and comet Borisov, have generated significant interest in the scientific community regarding the nature and origins of interstellar objects. Previous studies have suggested that comets like 3I/ATLAS may provide valuable information about the conditions in which they formed.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following its flyby of Earth, 3I/ATLAS is on a course that will take it beyond the solar planets and out of the solar system. Scientists plan to analyse data collected from this event, which could take several years, to better understand the comet's properties and origins.</p>
