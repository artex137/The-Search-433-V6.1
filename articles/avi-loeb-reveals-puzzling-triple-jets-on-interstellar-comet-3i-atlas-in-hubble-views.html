      <h2>Avi Loeb Reveals 'Puzzling' Triple Jets on Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS in Hubble Views</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has reported unusual findings regarding interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which is currently journeying through the constellation Leo. Observations made with the Hubble Space Telescope have revealed three symmetrical jets erupting from the comet's nucleus, a phenomenon noted during its closest approach to the Sun on October 29, 2025.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it challenges existing theories about comet behavior. Loeb has emphasized the need for further investigation into the comet's unique characteristics, particularly its geometric configuration that may suggest more than just natural processes.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to Sun:</strong> October 29, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> 68 kilometers per second</li>
    <li><strong>Observation Dates:</strong> November 30, December 12, December 27, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Earth at Closest Approach:</strong> 270 million kilometers (1.8 AU)</li>
    <li><strong>Probability of Trajectory Alignment:</strong> 0.2%</li>
    <li><strong>Radio Telescope Used:</strong> Green Bank Telescope</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 29, 2025, comet 3I/ATLAS reached its closest point to the Sun, moving at a speed of 68 kilometers per second. Following this, observations were made using the Hubble Space Telescope on three separate occasions: November 30, December 12, and December 27, 2025. On December 18, the Breakthrough Listen programme utilized the Green Bank Telescope to search for potential radio signals emanating from the comet.</p>

<p>Despite extensive analysis, the radio astronomers reported a 'nondetection' of signals, attributing the flagged candidate hits to human-made interference. As the comet continues its trajectory, scientists have noted the urgency to gather data before it fades from view.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "The equal angular separations of 360 degrees divided by three among these three jet axes is puzzling." He also noted, "The sheer mathematical perfection of this layout warrants intense scrutiny." </blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar visitor, following 'Oumuamua and Borisov. The comet's unique characteristics, including its highly symmetrical jets and unusual chemical signatures, have sparked debate about the nature of such celestial objects. While many in the scientific community view 3I/ATLAS as a natural phenomenon, some, including Loeb, have suggested it could represent a technological signature.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As scientists continue to analyze the data collected from Hubble and other observations, further investigations are expected to determine the nature of the comet's jets and whether they point to natural or artificial origins. The urgency to gather additional data is heightened, with experts estimating only a few hundred days remain before 3I/ATLAS becomes too faint for observation.</p>
