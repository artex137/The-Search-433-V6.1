      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/Atlas Sparks Alien Rumours as Scientists Explain Its Origins</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/Atlas has drawn global attention as it moves through the Solar System, prompting speculation about its origins and possible alien involvement. Scientists have stated that the comet behaves like a natural comet, despite its unique characteristics.</p>

<p>Authorities, including NASA and various astronomical institutions, are currently monitoring the comet's trajectory and composition. They emphasize that claims of alien technology or activity lack evidence and are not supported by scientific observations.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/Atlas was first detected on 1 July 2025 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-Impact Last Alert System in Chile.</li>
    <li>The comet is travelling at approximately 220,000 kilometres per hour.</li>
    <li>It will fly by Earth on or around 19 December 2025 at a distance of about 273 million kilometres.</li>
    <li>3I/Atlas is estimated to be around 11 billion years old.</li>
    <li>This comet is the third interstellar object identified, following 1I/'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The comet was first detected on 1 July 2025, with initial sightings possibly dating back to mid-June. Following its detection, scientists have been conducting observations to understand its composition and trajectory.</p>
<p>In October 2025, 3I/Atlas passed near Mars, and it is expected to make its closest approach to Earth on 19 December 2025. Researchers continue to study its unique chemistry and behaviour as it travels through the Solar System.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Everything observed so far is consistent with a comet from another star system and nothing indicates artificial origins,” said experts from Science Alert.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The comet's behaviour can be fully explained through its chemistry, its structure and its long journey through space,” explained Jason Wright of Penn State.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I/Atlas, the first interstellar object identified was 1I/'Oumuamua, which sparked similar speculation in 2017. The second, 2I/Borisov, was detected in 2019. Each of these objects has contributed to the growing interest in interstellar phenomena and their implications for understanding the universe.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers are preparing for further observations as 3I/Atlas approaches Jupiter in March 2026. NASA's Juno spacecraft may collect additional data during this encounter, providing more insights into the comet's origins and composition.</p>
