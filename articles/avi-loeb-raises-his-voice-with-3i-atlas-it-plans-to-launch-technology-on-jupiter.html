      <h2>Avi Loeb raises his voice with 3I/ATLAS: "It plans to launch technology on Jupiter"</h2>

<p>Harvard professor Avi Loeb has raised concerns about the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, asserting that it plans to launch technological devices on Jupiter. The object is currently the subject of intense scrutiny by the scientific community, particularly due to its unusual trajectory. NASA has classified 3I/ATLAS as a comet, but some scientists, including Loeb, challenge this assertion.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as it could reshape our understanding of interstellar objects and their origins. Loeb argues that the trajectory of 3I/ATLAS presents anomalies that suggest it may not be a natural comet but rather an artificial object. NASA continues to monitor the object, while other scientists evaluate Loeb's claims.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is expected to pass 53.445 million kilometers from Jupiter.</li>
    <li>This distance closely matches Jupiter's Hill radius of 53.502 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb claims the probability of such a precise trajectory is 1 in 26,000.</li>
    <li>The nucleus of 3I/ATLAS is approximately one million and one thousand times more massive than previous interstellar objects.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has continued to draw attention since its discovery. NASA has maintained its classification as a comet, while scientists, including Loeb, have questioned this designation. Loeb has published articles outlining his theories, which include the object's potential alien origin and its unusual trajectory.</p>
<p>Loeb has highlighted that the object appears to be positioned in such a way that it is not observable from Earth, raising further questions about its nature. Comparisons to previous interstellar objects, 1I/Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have also been made, with Loeb noting significant differences in their characteristics.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "3I/ATLAS plans to launch technological devices on Jupiter," emphasizing the object's unusual approach.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loeb described the trajectory as having "no simple explanation," suggesting that it is indicative of "non-gravitational acceleration."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The debate surrounding 3I/ATLAS is part of a broader discussion in the scientific community regarding interstellar objects. Previous objects like 1I/Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov have prompted similar inquiries about their origins and nature. Loeb's claims about 3I/ATLAS add a new dimension to this ongoing discourse.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and other scientific organizations will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Jupiter. Further analysis and discussions among scientists are expected as they evaluate Loeb's claims and the implications for our understanding of interstellar objects.</p>
