      <h2>TESS detected interstellar object 3I/ATLAS two months prior to its official discovery, showing signs of activity during that time</h2>

<p>Astronomers have reported that the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS was detected by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) as early as May 7, 2025, prior to its official discovery in early July 2025. This finding highlights the importance of multiple observational tools in tracking and understanding celestial phenomena.</p>

<p>The discovery allows researchers to analyze historical data of 3I/ATLAS, which exhibits unusual activity. Researchers from Michigan State University and Auburn University, led by Adina Feinstein, Darryl Seligman, and John Noonan, have indicated that the object's brightness increased significantly during its approach to the Sun, suggesting the presence of volatile materials. This may change current understandings of interstellar comets.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was first observed on May 7, 2025.</li>
    <li>Initial detection by TESS occurred approximately two months before its official discovery in July 2025.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was located about 6.35 astronomical units (AU) from the Sun on May 7.</li>
    <li>By June 2, its distance decreased to 5.47 AU.</li>
    <li>Its brightness surged by a factor of five during this time.</li>
    <li>Researchers used a technique called "shift-stacking" to analyze the data.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected in TESS data on May 7, 2025. The object was located at a distance of 6.35 AU from the Sun. By June 2, the distance reduced to 5.47 AU, coinciding with a notable increase in brightness. The official discovery of 3I/ATLAS occurred in early July 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The findings suggest that the composition of interstellar comets may differ substantially from those tethered to our solar system,” said Adina Feinstein, one of the lead researchers.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This discovery illustrates the potential for new insights into interstellar objects. Previous studies have focused primarily on comets within our solar system, which often lack the volatile materials found in 3I/ATLAS. The findings from TESS’s data could lead to a reevaluation of how scientists understand the characteristics of celestial objects that originate from outside our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to study 3I/ATLAS and similar interstellar objects to deepen understanding of their composition and behavior. Ongoing analysis of telescope archives may reveal more data that could further inform these investigations.</p>
