      <h2>3I/ATLAS: Harvard Astrophysicist Decodes Exocomet’s Anti-Tail Wobbling Before Perihelion</h2>

<p>In two days, on December 18, 2025, the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS will reach its closest approach to Earth, at a distance of 1.79 astronomical units (AU). Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has documented multiple anomalies in the comet's behavior, including a notable wobbling of its anti-tail.</p>

<p>This research matters as it provides insights into the dynamics of interstellar objects. Authorities, including major observatories and the Galileo Project, are analyzing data to better understand the comet's characteristics and behavior as it nears perihelion.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object discovered, following 1I/Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019.</li>
  <li>The comet was discovered by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) on July 1, 2025.</li>
  <li>It has displayed at least 14 anomalies since its discovery.</li>
  <li>The analysis of 3I/ATLAS's behavior was based on images captured over 37 nights between July 2 and September 5, 2025.</li>
  <li>Observations were made using the Two-meter Twin Telescope (TTT) at Teide Observatory in Tenerife, Spain.</li>
  <li>The periodicity of the wobble is measured at 7.74 (± 0.35) hours.</li>
  <li>The comet will be at its closest approach to Earth on December 18, 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by ATLAS. Observations began shortly after, with images collected from July 2 to September 5, 2025, at Teide Observatory. Prof. Loeb documented the anomalies in the comet's behavior, particularly the wobbling of its anti-tail, leading up to its perihelion on December 18, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Accurate measurements of the position angle of the jet at a projected distance of 6,000 kilometers from the brightness peak reveal a periodic modulation consistent with a high-latitude jet undergoing precession around the rotation axis of the nucleus,” said Prof. Loeb in his blog.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“This is the first periodic jet-angle modulation detected in an interstellar object,” he added, raising questions about the nature of the activity observed.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS follows the discovery of 1I/Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, both of which have provided valuable data on interstellar objects. The study of such comets helps scientists understand the formation and evolution of our solar system and beyond.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches perihelion and analyze additional data to confirm the nature of its anomalies and potential technological origins.</p>
