      <h2>3I/ATLAS Displays Unprecedented Jet Structure in Latest Image Analysis</h2>

<p>French astronomer François Kugel has captured a new image of interstellar object 3I/ATLAS on November 17, 2025, at 17:04 UTC, revealing extraordinary features that challenge existing cometary models. The comet shows intense brightness and multiple directional jets, but lacks a traditional dust tail. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with the observations.</p>

<p>This analysis is significant as it prompts astronomers to reconsider the behavior of comets. The findings suggest that 3I/ATLAS may possess unique surface properties or energy conversion efficiencies that differ from typical cometary characteristics. Astronomers continue to study the object to understand its unusual behavior.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Observation date: November 17, 2025</li>
    <li>Time of observation: 17:04 UTC</li>
    <li>Location: Right ascension 12h 44m 52.86s, declination +03° 18′ 14.2″</li>
    <li>Brightness magnitude: 11.8</li>
    <li>Distance from the Sun: approximately 1.43 astronomical units</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth: 2.16 astronomical units</li>
    <li>Jet mass loss rate: estimated at 50 billion tons per month</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 8, 2025, astronomers, including Michael Jäger, observed 3I/ATLAS displaying a faint dust tail and complex jet structures. The following day, November 9, the comet continued to show multi-directional jets. On November 11, it was confirmed that the object remained a single body after perihelion passage, with no signs of breakup. The latest image taken on November 17 revealed stable jet structures and an absence of a conventional tail.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The jets display remarkable characteristics. Rather than the broad, diffuse plumes typically associated with cometary outgassing, they appear as discrete, collimated streams — almost engineered in their precision,” said Kugel.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous observations of 3I/ATLAS have noted its unusual behavior, including the presence of anti-tails, which are jets directed toward the Sun. These observations suggest that the comet's characteristics do not conform to established models of cometary behavior. Past studies have shown that most comets exhibit rapid changes in jet structures due to thermal stresses, which contrasts with the stability observed in 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS to further investigate its properties and behavior. Ongoing studies will aim to determine the underlying mechanisms driving its unique jet structures and brightness levels.</p>
