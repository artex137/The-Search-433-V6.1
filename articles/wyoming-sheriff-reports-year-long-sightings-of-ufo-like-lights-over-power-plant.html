      <h2>Wyoming sheriff reports year-long sightings of ‘UFO-like’ lights over power plant</h2>

<p>Sheriff John Grossnickle of Sweetwater County has reported sightings of “UFO-like” lights over the Jim Bridger Power Plant and the surrounding Red Desert for more than a year. Residents have observed illuminated, saucer-shaped objects in coordinated formations for the past 13 months. The sheriff confirmed he personally witnessed the lights as recently as Saturday night.</p>

<p>The sightings have prompted local authorities to investigate, but they remain unexplained. According to sheriff's spokesman Jason Mower, the objects fly at high altitudes and have not caused any harm or disruption. The phenomenon has become so common that residents rarely file reports anymore. If the lights were to pose a threat or cause damage, the sheriff's office would "act accordingly."</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Sheriff John Grossnickle has reported sightings for over 13 months.</li>
    <li>Residents have observed the lights in coordinated formations.</li>
    <li>The sheriff personally witnessed the lights on December 16, 2025.</li>
    <li>Jason Mower, sheriff's spokesman, stated the objects are too high to be identified.</li>
    <li>Congresswoman Harriet Hageman has also viewed the lights.</li>
    <li>Niobrara County Sheriff Randy Starkey reported similar sightings from October to March last year.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In October 2024, residents in Sweetwater County began reporting sightings of unusual lights over the Jim Bridger Power Plant. The lights have continued to appear in various formations for the past 13 months. In March 2025, sightings in nearby Niobrara County ceased after several months of drone-like activity. On December 16, 2025, Sheriff Grossnickle personally witnessed the lights.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We’ve worked with everybody. We’ve done everything we can to figure out what they are, and nobody wants to give us any answers,” said Jason Mower.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“It’s like the new normal,” Mower added, referring to the frequency of the sightings.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The phenomenon of unidentified flying objects has gained political attention in Wyoming. During discussions regarding the Wyoming National Guard’s budget for counter-drone measures, State Senate Appropriations Chair Tim Salazar raised the issue of UAPs, or unidentified anomalous phenomena. Adjutant General Greg Porter stated he could not address the matter publicly.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities will continue to monitor the situation and investigate any potential threats. The sheriff's office has indicated they will respond appropriately should the lights pose a danger or cause damage.</p>
