      <h2>New images confirm prolonged activity of comet 3I/ATLAS after its closest approach to the sun</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has shown continued activity nearly three weeks after its closest approach to the sun on October 29, 2025. Renowned astrophotographer Efrain Morales captured new images of the comet on November 17, 2025, from Aguadilla, Puerto Rico, revealing its asymmetrical coma and elongated tail.</p>

<p>This ongoing activity matters for scientists studying celestial objects from outside the solar system. The detailed observations provide crucial data on the comet’s composition and behavior. Experts aim to understand the dynamics of such objects, which can offer insights into the early solar system and the materials that form it.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date of perihelion:</strong> October 29, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Earth during recent imaging:</strong> Approximately 190 million kilometers</li>
    <li><strong>Current speed:</strong> Approximately 221,000 kilometers per hour</li>
    <li><strong>Estimated nucleus diameter:</strong> Between 5 and 11 kilometers</li>
    <li><strong>Brightness:</strong> Magnitude 7 to 8, detectable by medium-sized telescopes</li>
    <li><strong>Upcoming closest approach to Earth:</strong> December 19, 2025, at a distance of 269 million kilometers</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 2, 2025, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter detected a halo of gas around the comet during its passage near Mars. The comet was approximately 30 million kilometers from the planet at that time. Observations continued with the Tianwen-1 telescope in October.</p>

<p>On November 3, the Gemini South Observatory in Chile recorded the comet's coma, measuring over 56,000 kilometers. By November 11, Projeto Telescópio Virtual captured detailed images of the comet, showcasing its narrow ionic tail.</p>

<p>NASA conducted a special broadcast on November 19, presenting images and analysis from various missions, including PUNCH, Lucy, and MAVEN, detailing the comet's journey and interactions in space.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The prolonged activity of 3I/ATLAS after perihelion is surprising and offers new insights into the comet’s internal composition,” said Efrain Morales, the astrophotographer who captured the latest images.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object confirmed within the solar system, following the hyperbolic trajectory of 2I/Borisov in 2019. Its extrasolar origin makes it a focal point for research, as astronomers seek to analyze its unique characteristics and behavior.</p>

<p>The comet's activity challenges previous assumptions about the decline of cometary behavior after perihelion, as it continues to eject jets of material, contributing to its coma and tail formation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Ongoing observations will continue to track the comet's trajectory and behavior as it approaches its closest point to Earth. Scientists will analyze the data collected from various missions to further understand the comet's characteristics and predict its future movements.</p>
