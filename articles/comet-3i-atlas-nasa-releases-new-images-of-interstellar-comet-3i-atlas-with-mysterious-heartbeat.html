      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS: NASA Releases New Images of Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS with Mysterious 'Heartbeat'</h2>

<p>NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) have released new images of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, showcasing its glowing nucleus and distinct tails as it travels through the solar system. The images were captured by the Hubble Space Telescope on November 30, 2025. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in relation to the comet.</p>

<p>This release is significant as scientists debate the comet's unusual activity, described as a rhythmic “heartbeat.” This phenomenon has sparked discussions regarding the origins of the comet. Researchers are currently studying its behavior as it approaches Earth for a close encounter on December 19, 2025.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Date of Images:</strong> November 30, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Encounter with Earth:</strong> December 19, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Exceeding 130,000 mph</li>
    <li><strong>Estimated Size:</strong> Between 1,400 feet and 3.5 miles wide</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> July 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025 and has since been identified as the third confirmed interstellar object to visit our solar system, following ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. On November 30, 2025, NASA released high-resolution images of the comet, revealing its unique features and the “heartbeat” phenomenon.</p>
<p>As it approaches its closest encounter with Earth on December 19, 2025, astronomers are preparing to study the comet in greater detail.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist, compared the comet’s brightness fluctuations to a heartbeat or the flow of blood. He suggested that the pulsing could indicate artificial origins or technological mechanisms.</blockquote>
<blockquote>NASA officials and other experts maintain that the object’s behavior is consistent with natural cometary activity, citing evidence of a coma and tails typical of icy bodies as they warm up near the Sun.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The “heartbeat” signal of 3I/ATLAS has generated considerable interest in the scientific community. While mainstream scientists attribute this phenomenon to the comet's rotation and the exposure of ice to the Sun, some researchers continue to explore alternative explanations.</p>
<p>The comet is notable for its distinct characteristics, including a bright, hazy atmosphere and two tails: a plasma tail of charged gas and a fainter dust tail.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth, astronomers will continue to investigate the comet’s “heartbeat” and gather data to refine size estimates. The scientific community remains focused on understanding the comet’s origins and behavior during its solar system visit.</p>
