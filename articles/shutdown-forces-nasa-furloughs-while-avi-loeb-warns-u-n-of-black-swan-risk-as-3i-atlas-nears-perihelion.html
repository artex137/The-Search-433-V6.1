      <h2>Shutdown Forces NASA Furloughs While Avi Loeb Warns U.N. of Black Swan Risk As 3I/ATLAS Nears Perihelion</h2>

<p>NASA has furloughed 83% of its federal workforce, affecting more than 15,000 employees, due to the ongoing federal government shutdown, just as astronomers prepare to observe interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS. The shutdown has created significant challenges for researchers who aim to study the comet, which is expected to reach its closest approach to the sun on October 3.</p>

<p>This situation is critical as Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist, has alerted the United Nations of a potential “Black Swan Event” related to 3I/ATLAS, emphasizing the need for global cooperation. October 3 marks a vital observation window before the comet disappears behind the sun, with the European Space Agency’s Mars and Jupiter probes set to collect essential data during this time.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>NASA has furloughed more than 15,000 employees, or 83% of its workforce.</li>
    <li>October 3 is the key date for observations of 3I/ATLAS.</li>
    <li>The comet is traveling at approximately 130,000 mph.</li>
    <li>Only essential personnel remain active at NASA during the shutdown.</li>
    <li>The ESA probes, including Mars Express and JUICE, are operational and may gather critical data.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In recent weeks, the U.S. federal government has been in a shutdown, leading to significant furloughs at NASA. The shutdown coincides with a crucial period for astronomers who are preparing to observe 3I/ATLAS as it approaches perihelion.</p>

<p>On October 3, astronomers will have a limited window to collect data on the comet before it moves out of view. Meanwhile, essential NASA missions continue to operate, allowing for potential scientific advancements despite the staff reductions.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb has stated, “We must coordinate globally to prepare for potential outcomes related to 3I/ATLAS.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The furlough of NASA employees is one of the largest in the agency's history, reflecting the ongoing impact of government shutdowns on scientific research. The situation is further complicated by the unique nature of 3I/ATLAS, which presents a rare opportunity for study due to its interstellar origin.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the shutdown continues, NASA will remain limited in its operational capacity, raising concerns about the data collection opportunities for 3I/ATLAS. Observations on October 3 will be critical, and the agency will need to navigate its furlough status while leveraging existing spacecraft to gather the necessary information.</p>
