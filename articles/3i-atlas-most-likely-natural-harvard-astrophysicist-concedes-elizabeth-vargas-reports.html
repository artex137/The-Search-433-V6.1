      <h2>3I/ATLAS ‘most likely natural,’ Harvard astrophysicist concedes</h2>

<p>Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist, has stated that comet 3I/ATLAS is “most likely natural” following its closest approach to Earth. He made these comments during an interview on “Elizabeth Vargas Reports.” There have been no reported injuries or fatalities linked to the comet.</p>

<p>This statement is significant as it marks a shift in Loeb's previous speculation that the comet might be alien technology. Authorities and scientists continue to analyze the data from 3I/ATLAS to understand its characteristics and origins.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS has reached its closest point to Earth.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb is a professor at Harvard University.</li>
    <li>Loeb has previously speculated about the comet's potential alien origins.</li>
    <li>There have been no injuries or fatalities reported.</li>
    <li>Loeb emphasized that many aspects of the comet remain unexplained.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first observed in 2019, marking it as the second known interstellar object to pass through the solar system. In recent weeks, as it approached Earth, interest and scrutiny of the comet increased.</p>
<p>On its closest approach, Loeb reassessed his earlier theories and stated that the evidence now suggests a natural origin, though he noted that certain anomalies still require explanation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“At this point, given all the data that we have, I would agree that it’s most likely natural, but there are still a lot of things we don’t understand about it,” said Loeb during the interview.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to this statement, Loeb had garnered attention for suggesting that 3I/ATLAS could be a piece of alien technology. His views sparked debate within the scientific community, highlighting the ongoing interest in interstellar objects and their implications for understanding the universe.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to analyze the data collected from 3I/ATLAS as they seek to clarify the remaining mysteries surrounding the comet.</p>
