      <h2>Latest 3I/ATLAS Update Raises Questions as to Whether Interstellar Comet is Harmless</h2>

<p>Harvard scientist Avi Loeb has analyzed interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, suggesting its chemical composition raises questions about its potential to seed life or deliver poison. His comments follow the release of new images and data from the European Space Agency (ESA) as the comet travels through the inner solar system.</p>

<p>Loeb's analysis is significant as it explores the implications of the comet's chemical makeup. Authorities are closely monitoring the comet's trajectory and characteristics to better understand its impact on planetary science.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is currently passing through the inner solar system.</li>
    <li>The ESA has released new images showing the comet with two tails.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb analyzed the comet's chemical composition, focusing on methanol and hydrogen cyanide ratios.</li>
    <li>Loeb concluded the comet is likely harmless due to its high methanol-to-hydrogen-cyanide ratio.</li>
    <li>Hydrogen sulfide, a poisonous gas, was also detected in the comet's gas cloud.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Avi Loeb has provided insights on 3I/ATLAS following the latest ESA images. The comet has shown significant gas emissions after its closest approach to the Sun, prompting further analysis of its chemical components.</p>
<p>Observations from the Atacama Large Millimetre/Submillimetre Array in Chile have confirmed the presence of methanol and hydrogen cyanide in the comet's gas cloud. Loeb has shared his conclusions about the implications of these findings in recent blog posts.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "On a blind date with an interstellar visitor, it is prudent to observe the dating partner and decide whether it could have seeded life on Earth or whether it represents a serial killer spreading poison – like an intergalactic cyanide tablet."</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loeb also remarked, "If the Solar System didn't have the building blocks, it could have gotten them from visits of objects like 3I/ATLAS in the early Solar System."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous studies of comets have suggested they may play a role in delivering essential compounds for life to planets. Loeb's analysis adds to the ongoing discussion about the potential benefits and dangers of interstellar objects.</p>
<p>The presence of poisonous compounds in celestial bodies has raised concerns in the scientific community about their implications for planetary environments.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it travels through the solar system, gathering data that could inform future research on the origins of life and the nature of interstellar objects.</p>
