      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS may collapse under solar heat, NASA warns</h2>

<p>NASA, in collaboration with the European Space Agency (ESA), has been closely tracking interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS since its discovery on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile. The comet, which follows a hyperbolic orbit, is expected to reach perihelion on October 29, 2025, at a distance of 1.36 astronomical units from the Sun, approximately 203 million kilometres.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as 3I/ATLAS is the third object of extrasolar origin detected in the Solar System. Authorities warn that the comet's proximity to the Sun may lead to the evaporation of volatile compounds and potential fragmentation, similar to the behaviour observed with comet 2I/Borisov in 2020.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>Expected perihelion on October 29, 2025, at 1.36 astronomical units (203 million km) from the Sun.</li>
    <li>Comet's speed is 245,000 km/h.</li>
    <li>Comet has an estimated nucleus diameter between 440 meters and 5.6 kilometers.</li>
    <li>Recent images show jets of dust and ice directed toward the Sun.</li>
    <li>Proximity to Mars recorded at 28 million kilometers on October 3, 2025.</li>
    <li>NASA's Europa Clipper will align with the comet's ion tail in late October 2025.</li>
    <li>Post-perihelion monitoring scheduled for March 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The ATLAS telescope detected 3I/ATLAS at a distance of 670 million kilometers from the Sun. Pre-discovery data came from NASA’s TESS satellite. Observations confirmed cometary activity at 6.4 astronomical units, indicating the release of hydroxyl derived from water.</p>

<p>As of October 21, 2025, images captured by the GOES-19 satellite’s CCOR-1 coronagraph showed a gas and dust coma, while ground-based observations have been limited due to the comet transiting behind the Sun. Ground telescopes are expected to resume observations in November 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The proximity of 3I/ATLAS to the Sun raises concerns about the potential for fragmentation,” said a NASA spokesperson.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 2I/Borisov, which fragmented in March 2020, serves as a cautionary example. Its nucleus split into two fragments after perihelion, releasing dust and carbon monoxide due to volatile evaporation and accelerated rotation.</p>

<p>3I/ATLAS is being monitored closely for similar changes, with telescopes set to track its activity as it approaches perihelion.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and ESA will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it nears the Sun. Observations are planned for November 2025, and if fragmentation occurs, dust trails will be detectable, expanding data on interstellar objects.</p>
