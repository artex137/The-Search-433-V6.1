      <h2>NASA Reveals 153,000mph Comet 3I/ATLAS Is Spewing 'Pristine Ices' As It Exits</h2>

<p>NASA has reported that comet 3I/ATLAS is travelling through the solar system at speeds exceeding <strong>153,000 miles per hour</strong> and is currently ejecting ancient ices as it exits. The comet was first detected on <strong>July 1, 2025</strong>, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) and has garnered significant attention as it nears the end of its journey through our solar system.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant because it provides scientists with an opportunity to study materials that have remained unchanged for billions of years. NASA's SPHEREx space telescope has captured new infrared images revealing the comet's brightening due to the release of these pristine ices, which could offer insights into the formation of planets and habitable worlds across the galaxy.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is travelling at over 153,000 miles per hour.</li>
    <li>First detected on July 1, 2025, by ATLAS.</li>
    <li>NASA's SPHEREx space telescope observed brightening in December 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet is releasing water vapour, carbon dioxide, methane, and other organic compounds.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object confirmed after &#699;Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected by ATLAS. It was confirmed to be on a hyperbolic trajectory, indicating it originated from another star system. In December 2025, NASA's SPHEREx space telescope captured new infrared images showing unexpected brightening as the comet approached its exit from the solar system.</p>

<p>The brightening was attributed to heat from the Sun penetrating the comet's outer crust, which led to the release of ancient ices preserved for billions of years. This activity has allowed scientists to study the chemical composition of materials from outside our solar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "3I/ATLAS has spent eons travelling through the near-absolute-zero vacuum of space, bombarded by cosmic radiation that likely hardened its outer surface." – NASA scientists
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "This activity is a scientific goldmine because it allows direct comparison between the building blocks of comets formed around other stars and those native to our solar system." – NASA scientists
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I/ATLAS, only two interstellar objects were confirmed: &#699;Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. These previous discoveries have sparked interest in the study of comets and their origins, leading to a greater understanding of the diversity of materials in the universe.</p>

<p>The unusual trajectory and high speed of 3I/ATLAS have also led to speculation about its nature, although mainstream scientists have dismissed claims of anything artificial, confirming it behaves like a natural comet.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to analyze the data from SPHEREx and other observatories as 3I/ATLAS exits the solar system. This research may provide valuable insights into the formation of planetary systems and the chemical diversity of comets.</p>
