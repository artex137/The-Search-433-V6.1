      <h2>10 U.S. States with the Most UFO Sightings</h2>

<p>California, Florida, and Texas are among the ten U.S. states with the most UFO sightings, according to data from the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC). These reports have accumulated over decades, with notable clusters in urban and rural areas alike. No injuries or fatalities have been reported directly linked to these sightings.</p>

<p>This information is significant as it highlights patterns in UFO sightings across the United States. Authorities and researchers continue to study these incidents to better understand public perception and potential explanations for the reports.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>California has logged over <strong>36,000</strong> UFO sightings.</li>
    <li>Florida has reported more than <strong>11,000</strong> sightings, primarily along the Gulf Coast.</li>
    <li>Texas has seen over <strong>6,000</strong> sightings, including a notable cluster near Stephenville in 2008.</li>
    <li>Pennsylvania has recorded more than <strong>5,000</strong> UFO reports since the 1970s.</li>
    <li>Arizona ranks high per capita for sightings, especially around Sedona and Phoenix.</li>
    <li>Colorado staff reported a disc-shaped object in 2023.</li>
    <li>Washington has a long history of sightings, including a famous incident near Mount Rainier in 1947.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Since the 1970s, NUFORC has collected data on UFO sightings from various states. California leads with the highest number of reports, while Florida follows closely behind. Over the years, specific incidents, like the Kecksburg incident in Pennsylvania in 1965 and the Stephenville sightings in Texas in 2008, have drawn attention and contributed to ongoing discussions about UFOs.</p>

<p>In 2023, staff at a concert venue in Colorado reported a disc-shaped object, adding to the state's growing list of sightings.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Reports tend to come from ordinary moments, such as looking up at the wrong or right time,” said a NUFORC representative.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Clear nights and open skies help people notice unusual movement more easily,” the representative added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to the current trends, UFO sightings have often been linked to specific geographical features or military activity. States like Nevada and Colorado benefit from wide-open spaces and active military airspace, which can contribute to confusion over unidentified flying objects.</p>

<p>Historical incidents, such as the McMinnville images from 1950 in Oregon and the 1947 sighting near Mount Rainier, continue to influence public interest and reporting patterns in the regions.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities and researchers will continue to investigate reported UFO sightings. There are no specific deadlines or charges associated with these investigations at this time.</p>
