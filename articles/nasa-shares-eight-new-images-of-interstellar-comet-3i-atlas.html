      <h2>NASA Shares Eight New Images of Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>NASA has released eight new images of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, showcasing the comet's features and behavior as it approaches Earth. The images were captured by various spacecraft, including those in Mars orbit and deep-space missions, and were shared on November 19, 2025. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to the comet.</p>

<p>The release of these images is significant as it enhances our understanding of interstellar objects, which are rare. 3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object and the second interstellar comet ever observed. NASA is utilizing a global network of spacecraft to monitor the comet, which has been active, shedding dust and producing gas that forms a growing coma and tail.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is on a hyperbolic trajectory, indicating it is from outside the solar system.</li>
    <li>The comet reached speeds of approximately <strong>246,000 km/h</strong> (153,000 mph) as it swung around the Sun.</li>
    <li>It will make its closest approach to Earth in <strong>December 2025</strong>, at a distance of about <strong>1.8 AU</strong> (nearly 170 million miles).</li>
    <li>NASA has coordinated observations from multiple spacecraft, including the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and MAVEN.</li>
    <li>The comet was first discovered on <strong>July 1, 2025</strong>, by the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers first detected comet 3I/ATLAS, noting its unusual trajectory. NASA confirmed its interstellar origin shortly after. The comet has since been observed by several spacecraft, providing a multi-perspective view of its activity and evolution.</p>
<p>Significant observations include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>October 2, 2025: The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter captured detailed images of the comet's inner coma.</li>
    <li>Between October 15-16, 2025: The SOHO mission tracked the comet near the Sun.</li>
    <li>September 16, 2025: The Lucy spacecraft provided images from a deep-space perspective.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "Every particle it releases carries information about a different planetary system," NASA stated regarding the significance of the comet's observations.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interstellar comets like 3I/ATLAS provide valuable insights into the formation of icy bodies around distant stars. Prior to 3I/ATLAS, only two other interstellar objects have been confirmed, making this observation a rare opportunity for scientists.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to monitor comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth in December 2025, utilizing multiple spacecraft to gather data on its behavior and characteristics. Further analyses of the collected data will enhance understanding of interstellar comets and their origins.</p>
