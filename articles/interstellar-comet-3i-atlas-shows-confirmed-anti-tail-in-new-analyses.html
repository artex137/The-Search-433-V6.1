      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS shows confirmed anti-tail in new analyses</h2>

<p>Astronomers have confirmed the presence of an anti-tail in the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS through observations conducted in October 2025. The comet, discovered in July 2025 by the NASA-funded ATLAS system, is currently about 3.8 astronomical units from the Sun, and its elongated structure points toward the Sun, differing from typical comet tails that extend away from it.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as 3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object to visit the Solar System, following 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Scientists are closely monitoring the comet's trajectory and composition to better understand its origins and the processes affecting its structure.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is approximately 3.8 AU from the Sun.</li>
    <li>The comet will reach perihelion on October 30, 2025, at a distance of 1.4 AU from the Sun.</li>
    <li>Its speed exceeds 200,000 kilometers per hour.</li>
    <li>The anti-tail extends about 30 arcseconds, or 56,000 kilometers.</li>
    <li>The comet's mass is estimated to exceed 33 billion tons.</li>
    <li>Observations recorded the release of about 150 kilograms of material per second.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will approach Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of 1.8 AU.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025 by the ATLAS system. Observations from the Hubble Space Telescope in July revealed a faint eastward tail. In August, the anti-tail was first detected, and by September, telescopes like the Nordic Optical Telescope captured images of the tail transitioning to a conventional form. This shift is attributed to the sublimation of volatile materials as the comet approaches the Sun.</p>

<p>As the comet nears perihelion, its activity is expected to increase, with ground-based telescopes resuming tracking in November 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The presence of the anti-tail provides new insights into the physical processes at play in comets and how they interact with solar radiation,” said a spokesperson from the WM Keck Observatory.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The phenomenon of an anti-tail has been observed in past comets, such as Kohoutek in 1974. These occurrences challenge conventional understandings of cometary behavior and illuminate the complexities of their interactions with solar forces. 3I/ATLAS's high velocity and hyperbolic trajectory further distinguish it from typical comets, which often have elliptical orbits.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following perihelion on October 30, astronomers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth. The James Webb Space Telescope will conduct chemical analyses, and ground-based observations will focus on potential changes in brightness or structure as the comet continues on its path.</p>
