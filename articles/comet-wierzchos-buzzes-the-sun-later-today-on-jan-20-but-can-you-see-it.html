      <h2>Comet Wierzchos approaches the sun today at 1:24 p.m. EST</h2>
<p>Comet C/2024 E1 (Wierzchos) has made its closest approach to the sun today, January 20, at 1:24 p.m. EST (1824 GMT), passing at a distance of 52.6 million miles (84.6 million km). There have been no reports of injuries or fatalities related to this astronomical event.</p>

<p>The significance of this event lies in the comet's expected increase in brightness as it nears the sun, which may enhance its visibility for observers using telescopes. Astronomers have noted that the heat from the sun will cause the comet to release gas and dust, creating a reflective coma and characteristic tail. The comet will be visible in the southern constellation Microscopium and is anticipated to reach a peak brightness of around +8.1 following its perihelion.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Event:</strong> Close approach of Comet C/2024 E1 (Wierzchos)</li>
    <li><strong>Date:</strong> January 20, 2024</li>
    <li><strong>Time:</strong> 1:24 p.m. EST (1824 GMT)</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from the sun:</strong> 52.6 million miles (84.6 million km)</li>
    <li><strong>Peak brightness:</strong> Estimated at +8.1</li>
    <li><strong>Visibility:</strong> Requires a small telescope; beyond naked-eye visibility</li>
    <li><strong>Next close approach:</strong> February 17, 2024, at a distance of 93 million miles (1 Astronomical Unit)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet Wierzchos was discovered in March 2024 during the Catalina Sky Survey, a NASA-funded project at the University of Arizona. The comet has been observed as it traveled sunward, and its perihelion today marks a key moment in its journey.</p>
<p>Following today’s approach, the comet will continue to be monitored, particularly as it reaches its peak brightness in the days ahead.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The heat from the sun vaporizes ice material in the comet’s solid nucleus, releasing masses of gas and dust that form a reflective cocoon around the nucleus,” said astronomers involved in the observations.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet C/2024 E1 (Wierzchos) is part of a larger group of comets that originate from the Oort Cloud, a shell of icy material surrounding the solar system. This comet is notable for its brightness and potential visibility, particularly for amateur astronomers.</p>
<p>Previous comets have exhibited similar behavior during perihelion, often becoming visible with the aid of telescopes.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>After today’s event, astronomers will continue to observe Comet Wierzchos as it moves away from the sun. It is expected to be visible again during its close approach to Earth on February 17, 2024, when it will appear low on the southwestern horizon at sunset.</p>
