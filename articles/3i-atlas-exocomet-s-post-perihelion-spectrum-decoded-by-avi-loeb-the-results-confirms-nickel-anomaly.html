      <h2>3I/ATLAS: Exocomet’s Post-Perihelion Spectrum Decoded By Avi Loeb; The Results Confirms Nickel Anomaly</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has decoded the post-perihelion spectrum of comet 3I/ATLAS, revealing significant findings about its nickel emissions. The data, obtained on November 16, 2025, from the Keck Cosmic Web Imager at the Keck II telescope in Hawaii, indicates an extraordinary nickel enrichment compared to Solar System comets. The exocomet, first spotted on July 1, 2025, has raised questions about its classification as a comet due to its anomalous characteristics.</p>

<p>This research is significant as it challenges traditional understandings of interstellar objects. Authorities in the scientific community are closely examining these findings, which may suggest that 3I/ATLAS possesses features not typically associated with comets. The ongoing investigation into its composition could reshape theories about the nature of similar celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS entered the Oort Cloud approximately 8000 years ago.</li>
    <li>First detected by the ATLAS observatory on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Post-perihelion data was collected on November 16, 2025.</li>
    <li>The analysis indicates a Ni/Fe ratio evolution of 1.15 ± 0.05 at heliocentric distances beyond 2.5 AU.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb has identified at least 18 anomalies associated with 3I/ATLAS.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first observed on July 1, 2025, during its passage through the solar system. Following its perihelion on October 29, 2025, researchers collected data to analyze its characteristics. The post-perihelion spectrum was decoded by Avi Loeb on November 16, 2025, revealing a significant nickel enrichment that deviates from the expected emissions of typical comets.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The plume of gas around 3I/ATLAS had an anomalously high nickel to iron ratio at large distances from the Sun,” said Avi Loeb, highlighting the unusual nature of the exocomet.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object, following 1I/Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. The previous discoveries have prompted ongoing discussions regarding the origins and classifications of such celestial bodies. The unique characteristics of 3I/ATLAS, including its symmetrical mini-jets and sunward anti-tail, challenge conventional comet definitions.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to study the data collected from 3I/ATLAS to better understand its composition and the implications of its nickel anomaly. Further observations and analyses are expected as scientists seek to clarify the nature of this interstellar object.</p>
