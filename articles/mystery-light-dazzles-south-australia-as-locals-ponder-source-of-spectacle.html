      <h2>Mystery light dazzles South Australia as locals ponder source of spectacle</h2>

<p>A mystery light that dazzled residents across South Australia on Friday morning has been identified as likely rocket exhaust from a recent launch. Stargazers in locations such as Strathalbyn, Seaview, and Largs Bay reported seeing two beams drifting across the dawn sky. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>The unusual sight ignited a flurry of speculation on social media, with some locals jokingly suggesting it was a UFO, a spy rocket, or even a pigeon wearing a vest with lights. Experts have clarified that the phenomenon was most likely linked to the launch of Ariane 6 from Europe’s Spaceport in French Guiana, which took place at 3:15 a.m. Adelaide time and carried 32 satellites for Amazon.</p>
