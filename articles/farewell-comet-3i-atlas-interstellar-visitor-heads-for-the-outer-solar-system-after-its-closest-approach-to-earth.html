      <h2>Farewell, comet 3I/ATLAS! Interstellar visitor heads for the outer solar system after its closest approach to Earth</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has made its closest approach to Earth, coming within 168 million miles (270 million kilometers) of the planet at 1 a.m. EST (0600 GMT) on December 19, 2025. The interstellar comet is now moving back toward the outer solar system after this significant encounter.</p>

<p>This event is important for scientists as it provides a rare opportunity to study materials from outside the solar system. 3I/ATLAS is only the third known interstellar object to pass through the solar system, following 1I/'Oumuamua in 2017 and comet 2I/Borisov in 2019. Observations of 3I/ATLAS can help researchers understand the composition of comets, asteroids, and planets that formed around other stars.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Closest approach occurred on December 19, 2025, at 1 a.m. EST (0600 GMT).</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth during closest approach: 168 million miles (270 million kilometers).</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was first spotted by NASA's Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet originates from the Milky Way's "thick disk," potentially making it up to 7 billion years old.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS has brightened unexpectedly as it approached the sun.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected by NASA's ATLAS program on July 1, 2025. Following its discovery, astronomers tracked its trajectory, confirming it came from interstellar space. The comet made its closest approach to the sun on October 29, 2025, and subsequently brightened more than expected as it neared Earth.</p>

<p>On December 19, 2025, 3I/ATLAS reached its closest point to Earth, before beginning its journey back into the outer solar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “All non-interstellar comets, such as Halley’s comet, formed at the same time as our solar system, so they are up to 4.5 billion years old,” said Matthew Hopkins, an astronomer at the University of Oxford. “But interstellar visitors have the potential to be far older, and of those known about so far, our statistical method suggests that 3I/ATLAS is very likely to be the oldest comet we have ever seen.”
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “The reason for 3I’s rapid brightening, which far exceeds the brightening rate of most Oort cloud comets at similar radial distances, remains unclear,” stated Qicheng Zhang from Lowell Observatory and Karl Battams from the Naval Research Laboratory in a paper discussing their observations.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is significant as it provides insights into the composition of ancient celestial bodies. Its predecessors, 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have already helped scientists learn about interstellar objects. The study of such comets is essential for understanding the formation of the solar system and others like it.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey through the Milky Way, scientists will analyze the data collected during its time in the solar system. This research will enhance our understanding of interstellar objects and their origins for years to come.</p>
