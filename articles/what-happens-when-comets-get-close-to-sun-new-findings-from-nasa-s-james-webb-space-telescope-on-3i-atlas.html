      <h2>NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope Observes Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has observed the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS for the first time on August 6, 2025. This observation utilized JWST's infrared capabilities and its Near-Infrared Spectrograph instrument (NIRSpec). The study, detailed in a preprint paper, reveals significant findings about the comet's composition and behavior as it approaches the sun.</p>

<p>The findings from the JWST are crucial for understanding the formation conditions of interstellar comets. The study aims to compare the characteristics of 3I/ATLAS with what scientists know about the early solar system, particularly the conditions present 4.6 billion years ago when the planets and other celestial bodies were forming. Astronomers have highlighted that studying such comets can provide insights into the materials and processes that existed in their parent star systems.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovered:</strong> July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey telescope.</li>
    <li><strong>First observed:</strong> August 6, 2025, by NASA’s JWST.</li>
    <li><strong>Interstellar comet:</strong> 3I/ATLAS is the third known object from another star system.</li>
    <li><strong>Previous interstellar comets:</strong> 1I/'Oumuamua (2017) and 2I/Borisov (2019).</li>
    <li><strong>Key findings:</strong> High levels of carbon dioxide, water, carbon monoxide, and carbonyl sulfide detected in the comet's coma.</li>
    <li><strong>Notable observation:</strong> Highest observed ratio of carbon dioxide to water in a comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey telescope. Following its discovery, NASA's JWST observed the comet on August 6, 2025. The observations focused on identifying the comet's size, physical properties, and chemical makeup, particularly as it approached the sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The abundance of carbon dioxide in the coma of 3I/ATLAS could indicate that the interstellar comet is intrinsically rich in carbon dioxide,” according to astronomers involved in the study.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Studying comets like this from other star systems helps to better understand what the conditions were like in those systems as they were forming,” noted researchers.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS adds to the growing list of interstellar objects observed in our solar system, which includes 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. These observations are significant as they offer a glimpse into the materials and processes beyond our solar system, enhancing our understanding of comet formation and the early conditions of planetary systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further studies are expected as astronomers continue to analyze data from JWST and compare it with previous findings from other comets. This ongoing research aims to deepen our understanding of the origins of interstellar comets and their implications for solar system formation.</p>
