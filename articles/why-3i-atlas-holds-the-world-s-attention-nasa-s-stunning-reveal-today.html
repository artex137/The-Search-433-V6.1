      <h2>NASA to Reveal Stunning Imagery of Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>
<p>The US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has scheduled a live event to unveil new imagery of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1) on Wednesday, November 19, at 3 pm EST (12 midnight on November 20, 2025, in the UAE). The event will take place at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and will showcase images and data collected from various NASA missions observing the comet as it travels through the Solar System.</p>

<p>This event is significant as 3I/ATLAS provides a rare opportunity for astrophysicists to study a cosmic visitor from beyond the Milky Way. Authorities expect the imagery and data to enhance understanding of the comet's composition and origins, with implications for planetary formation and chemical evolution in other star systems.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Event Date:</strong> November 19, 2025, at 3 pm EST</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach:</strong> December 19, 2025, at a distance of about 1.8 AU (approximately 170 million miles or 270 million km)</li>
    <li><strong>Discovered:</strong> July 1, 2025, by the NASA-funded ATLAS observatory</li>
    <li><strong>Previous Closest Approach to Mars:</strong> October 3, 2025, at a distance of about 19 million miles</li>
    <li><strong>Streaming Platforms:</strong> NASA+, NASA app, official website, YouTube channel, and Amazon Prime</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS observatory. It reached perihelion, or its closest point to the Sun, on October 29, 2025. The comet made its closest approach to Mars on October 3, 2025. NASA's live event is set for November 19, 2025, with the comet's closest approach to Earth occurring on December 19, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Studying 3I/ATLAS offers insight into the conditions and materials that exist in other planetary systems across our galaxy,” said Amit Kshatriya, Associate Administrator of NASA.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The comet acts as a natural sample sent from distant star systems, helping scientists understand the broader cosmos,” noted Shawn Domagal-Goldman, Acting Director of the Astrophysics Division.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed object identified as originating from outside the Solar System. Its trajectory, described as "hyperbolic," poses no threat to Earth, as it will remain well beyond the Moon's orbit during its passage. This unique comet provides a valuable opportunity for scientists to explore interstellar materials and enhance knowledge about planetary systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA experts will continue to gather detailed observations of 3I/ATLAS leading up to its closest approach, promising further discoveries and insights into this interstellar visitor.</p>
