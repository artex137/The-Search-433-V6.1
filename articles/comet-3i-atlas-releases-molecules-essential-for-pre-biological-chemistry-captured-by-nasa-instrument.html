      <h2>Comet 3I/Atlas releases molecules essential for pre-biological chemistry captured by NASA instrument</h2>

<p>NASA has reported that Comet 3I/Atlas has released molecules crucial for pre-biological chemistry, as detected by its spacecraft instruments. The discovery occurred during the comet's close approach to Earth in February 2026.</p>

<p>This finding is significant because it may provide insights into the origins of life on Earth. NASA scientists are analyzing the data collected to understand the implications of these molecules in the context of astrobiology.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event occurred in February 2026.</li>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas approached Earth closely.</li>
    <li>Molecules detected are essential for pre-biological chemistry.</li>
    <li>NASA's instruments captured the data during the close approach.</li>
    <li>Analysis of the data is ongoing.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In early February 2026, Comet 3I/Atlas made its closest approach to Earth. During this period, NASA's instruments detected molecules released from the comet. These findings were reported shortly after the close encounter.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The release of these molecules may provide crucial insights into the conditions that led to the emergence of life on our planet,” said a NASA scientist involved in the study.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comets are often considered time capsules of the early solar system. Previous studies have suggested that they could contain organic materials that are important for understanding life's origins. This recent discovery adds to the growing body of evidence supporting this theory.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA plans to continue analyzing the data from Comet 3I/Atlas to explore the implications of these findings for astrobiology and the study of life’s origins.</p>
