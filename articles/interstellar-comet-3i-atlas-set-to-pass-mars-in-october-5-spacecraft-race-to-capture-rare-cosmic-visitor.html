      <p class="byline">Published 2025-10-03 10:26 UTC</p>

      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS set to pass Mars in October</h2>

<p>An interstellar comet named 3I/ATLAS is set to make its closest approach to Mars on October 3, 2025, at a distance of about 30 million kilometers (18.6 million miles). This rare cosmic visitor has generated significant interest among space agencies worldwide, as it is the third confirmed interstellar object to enter our solar system.</p>

<p>The approach of comet 3I/ATLAS provides a unique opportunity for Mars orbiters, including ESA’s Mars Express and ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter, to observe the comet directly. NASA’s Psyche spacecraft will also gain a glimpse of the comet shortly after its flyby of Mars. This event is crucial for scientists, as it allows them to study the comet’s structure and composition, which may offer insights into the building blocks of planets and life beyond Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date of Mars flyby:</strong> October 3, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Mars:</strong> Approximately 30 million kilometers (18.6 million miles)</li>
    <li><strong>Comet speed:</strong> About 130,000 mph (219,000 km/h)</li>
    <li><strong>Nucleus size:</strong> Estimated to be less than 1 kilometer across</li>
    <li><strong>Expected Earth pass:</strong> December 2025 at roughly 167 million miles (269 million kilometers)</li>
    <li><strong>Next close approach:</strong> March 2026 near Jupiter</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers detected the fast-moving comet 3I/ATLAS through the NASA-funded ATLAS survey telescope in Chile. This marked the official recognition of the comet as the third confirmed interstellar object entering our solar system.</p>

<p>Following its approach to Mars in October 2025, the comet will reach perihelion, its closest point to the Sun, between November 2 and 25, 2025. During this period, ESA’s Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) will monitor the comet as it approaches Jupiter.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The unique composition of 3I/ATLAS offers scientists a window into the chemistry and conditions of other star systems,” said a representative from ESA. “By studying this comet, we hope to learn more about the building blocks of planets and possibly life beyond Earth.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable not only for its interstellar origin but also for its complex composition. Observations from powerful telescopes have revealed a rich mix of carbon dioxide, water ice, and carbon monoxide in the comet’s tail. This composition differs from many comets formed within our solar system, providing a unique perspective on cosmic materials.</p>

<p>Previous interstellar objects, such as 'Oumuamua and comet 2I/Borisov, have also sparked scientific interest, but 3I/ATLAS presents a new opportunity for direct observation and analysis.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Space agencies, including NASA and ESA, are preparing to capture data from 3I/ATLAS during its passes by Mars and Jupiter. Researchers hope to utilize this data to enhance our understanding of cometary science and interstellar materials as the comet exits the solar system in early 2026.</p>
