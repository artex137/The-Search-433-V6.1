      <p class="byline">Published 2025-11-04 20:24 UTC</p>

      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Surges in Brightness as It Nears the Sun</h2>

<p>Astronomers have observed a dramatic increase in brightness from comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun, with significant observations made on October 29, 2025. The comet, an interstellar object, has transitioned from a faint presence to a striking spectacle in just a few weeks, surprising experts with its rapid luminosity changes.</p>

<p>This phenomenon is noteworthy because it challenges typical comet behavior, which usually sees a gradual increase in brightness as solar heat vaporizes the comet's surface. Researchers are currently using solar observation satellites to track 3I/ATLAS, as ground-based telescopes have been unable to monitor it due to its position behind the Sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS passed closest to the Sun on October 29, 2025.</li>
    <li>Its brightness has increased at nearly double the rate of typical comets.</li>
    <li>Observations have been made using NASA’s STEREO-A, ESA’s SOHO, and NOAA’s GOES-19 satellites.</li>
    <li>The comet is currently about 1.36 astronomical units from the Sun.</li>
    <li>It has shown a shift to a bluish hue, indicating the release of volatile materials.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has experienced a remarkable increase in brightness in the weeks leading up to its closest approach to the Sun on October 29, 2025. Researchers have utilized solar observation satellites to monitor the comet's changes as it moved from about twice the Earth’s distance from the Sun to its closest point.</p>
<p>As the comet neared perihelion, astronomers noted a steep increase in brightness, which deviated from typical comet behavior. The shift in color to a bluish hue further indicates the release of gases, suggesting that volatile materials are being exposed.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The change has been striking,” said Qicheng Zhang of Lowell Observatory. “The rapid evolution of 3I/ATLAS is unlike what we typically see with comets.” 
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable for its interstellar origin, making it a rare subject of study for astronomers. Previous observations of comets have generally shown a gradual brightening as they approach the Sun, with 3I/ATLAS's rapid change raising questions about its composition and the processes at work within it.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey and emerges from behind the Sun in November and December, astronomers anticipate further observations that may reveal the factors behind its extraordinary brightness. Researchers hope to uncover insights into the comet’s composition and behavior as it becomes visible from Earth.</p>
