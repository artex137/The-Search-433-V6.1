      <h2>NASA's November 19 Press Conference on Comet 3I/ATLAS Fails to Provide Clarity</h2>

<p>NASA held a press conference on November 19 to discuss the comet 3I/ATLAS, but no significant new information was released. Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb, who attended the event, criticized NASA for not addressing key anomalies related to the comet's characteristics. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with the event.</p>

<p>This lack of clarity is concerning for the scientific community, as many questions remain about 3I/ATLAS. NASA has reiterated its position that the comet is a natural object, attributing delays in data release to the recent government shutdown. However, Loeb argues that numerous unexplained phenomena surrounding the comet warrant further investigation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of press conference: November 19</li>
    <li>Location: NASA</li>
    <li>Key speaker: Avi Loeb, Harvard astrophysicist</li>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS characteristics: Mass one million times greater than 'Oumuamua</li>
    <li>Notable anomalies: Improbable trajectory, rare mass, anti-tail, forward-facing jets</li>
    <li>Recent amateur astronomer contributions: Significant images showing jets</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>NASA's press conference on November 19 aimed to clarify the status of 3I/ATLAS, which has been under scrutiny since its discovery.</p>
<p>During the event, NASA confirmed that the comet is a natural object and attributed delays in data release to the government shutdown. However, Loeb pointed out that NASA did not address the twelve anomalies he has identified, which include the comet's mass and unusual trajectory.</p>
<p>Loeb has stated that the most meaningful images of the comet have come from amateur astronomers, who have captured the jets extending nearly a million kilometers from the object.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb expressed disappointment, stating, "NASA emphasized what they believe, not what remains unexplained."</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loeb noted, "The jets captured in recent nights are far more exciting than the smudged HiRISE image."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discussion surrounding 3I/ATLAS has gained attention due to its size and unusual characteristics, especially in comparison to previous interstellar objects like 'Oumuamua. The ongoing debate highlights the challenges in understanding such celestial phenomena.</p>
<p>Loeb has been vocal about the need for more rigorous scientific inquiry into the anomalies associated with 3I/ATLAS, emphasizing that important questions remain unanswered.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA has not disclosed any upcoming plans for further investigation into 3I/ATLAS. The scientific community is likely to continue exploring the anomalies noted by Loeb and others in hopes of gaining a clearer understanding of the comet.</p>
