      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS May Hide an Unexpected Object Inside</h2>

<p>In a recent analysis, astronomers have suggested that comet 3I/ATLAS, the largest and fastest interstellar object discovered to date, may conceal an alien spacecraft within it. Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has presented these findings, which could have significant implications for our understanding of interstellar travel.</p>

<p>Loeb's research indicates that objects like 3I/ATLAS, which exceed one kilometer in size and travel at speeds over 60 kilometers per second, could be utilized by extraterrestrial civilizations as vessels for exploration. Authorities are now considering the potential for such objects to serve as platforms for advanced technology, particularly in the context of resource utilization like water extraction.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the largest interstellar object detected, exceeding 1 kilometer in size.</li>
  <li>It travels at speeds exceeding 60 kilometers per second.</li>
  <li>SOHO spacecraft detected a release of 13.5 million tons of water from 3I/ATLAS over one month.</li>
  <li>Close approach to Jupiter is scheduled for March 16, 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In the last decade, astronomers have identified three interstellar objects, with 3I/ATLAS being the most significant due to its size and speed. Recent observations by the SOHO spacecraft have revealed a substantial hydrogen outburst from the comet, raising questions about its potential use by an extraterrestrial civilization.</p>

<p>Loeb has noted that if a spacecraft is hidden within the comet, it could explain various anomalies observed, including the trajectory alignment with the Solar System's planets and the unique composition of 3I/ATLAS. This information has prompted further interest in monitoring the comet as it approaches Jupiter.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "If a spacecraft were sent to study comet 3I/ATLAS from a close distance, it could potentially discover the energy source needed to convert water into hydrogen and oxygen fuel, as well as to power the spacecraft inside the comet."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This analysis builds on previous research into the potential for interstellar objects to host advanced technology. The idea of using natural resources from such objects for space travel has gained traction among scientists, particularly as humanity seeks sustainable methods for exploration beyond our Solar System.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Jupiter in March 2026, astronomers plan to continue monitoring it closely. This ongoing observation may yield critical insights into the comet's composition and any hidden structures within.</p>
