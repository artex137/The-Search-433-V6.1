      <h2>NASA on alert after interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS transmits enigmatic continuous radio signal</h2>

<p>NASA has intensified its monitoring of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which has been emitting a continuous radio signal. The alert was issued on January 10, 2026, as space agencies assess the comet's unusual behavior. There have been no reports of injuries or fatalities related to this event.</p>

<p>The detection of the radio signal from 3I/ATLAS presents a unique opportunity to study material from another star system. NASA’s Escritório of Coordenação of Defesa Planetária is leading efforts to collect data during the comet's brief passage through the solar system, which will occur on December 19, 2025. The comet is not expected to pose any risk of collision with Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is traveling at approximately 100,000 km/h.</li>
    <li>Its core is estimated to be between 320 meters and 5.6 km in diameter.</li>
    <li>The comet will make its closest approach to Earth at a distance of 270 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>NASA and the Agência Espacial Europeia (ESA) have confirmed its safe trajectory.</li>
    <li>The radio signal was detected by the MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa.</li>
    <li>The comet's passage through the solar system will last until it returns to deep space.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In August 2025, NASA convened a team of experts to evaluate comet 3I/ATLAS after detecting its atypical behavior.</p>
<p>On January 10, 2026, NASA announced that the comet was emitting a continuous radio signal, prompting heightened monitoring efforts.</p>
<p>The closest approach of 3I/ATLAS to Earth is scheduled for December 19, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The emission of radio waves, although of natural origin, is a phenomenon that requires in-depth investigation,” said a NASA spokesperson. “Our objective is to gather as much data as possible during this unique opportunity.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar visitor to the solar system, following ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Unlike its predecessors, 3I/ATLAS exhibits remarkable stability and a continuous natural radio emission, which intrigues researchers.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and international partners will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS closely in the coming months, analyzing its brightness variations and radio signals for any changes that may indicate new material ejections or internal activity.</p>
