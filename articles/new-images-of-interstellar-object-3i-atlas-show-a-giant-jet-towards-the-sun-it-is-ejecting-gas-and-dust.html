      <h2>New images of interstellar object 3I/ATLAS show a giant ‘jet’ towards the Sun: it is ejecting gas and dust</h2>

<p>NASA has discovered a comet designated 3I/ATLAS, which may have originated from an unknown star system, as it approaches the Sun. The comet, which measures between 5 and 11 kilometers across, is the largest interstellar object ever observed in our solar system and may date back billions of years before the Sun's formation. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this discovery.</p>

<p>This finding is significant as it provides insight into the nature of interstellar objects. Authorities at NASA and the Teide Observatory are closely monitoring the comet's behavior and trajectory as it approaches the Sun, with its closest point expected on October 29.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS measures between 5 and 11 kilometers across.</li>
    <li>It is the largest interstellar object observed in the solar system.</li>
    <li>The comet was captured on August 2 at the Twin Two-Meter Telescope in Tenerife, Spain.</li>
    <li>Images were shared by The Astronomer’s Telegram on October 15.</li>
    <li>The comet is expected to reach its closest point to the Sun on October 29.</li>
    <li>Visibility from Earth will return in mid-November.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In early July, NASA discovered the comet 3I/ATLAS, believed to have originated from a distant star system. On August 2, the comet was observed at the Twin Two-Meter Telescope in Tenerife, Spain. Recent images were shared on October 15, showcasing a large black nucleus surrounded by a glowing tail. The comet is projected to reach its closest approach to the Sun on October 29.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Miquel Serra-Ricart, an astrophysicist and director of science at the Teide Observatory’s Light Bridges research institution, stated, “Comets are known for their bright tails of ionized gas, but their smaller cometary jets usually point toward the Sun.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Serra-Ricart added, “If there’s any concern about this phenomenon, it’s entirely normal—a standard feature of cometary anatomy.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS adds to the growing body of research on interstellar objects. Previous studies have indicated that such objects may offer clues to the formation of the solar system and the conditions of distant star systems. The behavior of comets as they approach the Sun is well-documented, with uneven heating leading to the ejection of gas and dust.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its approach towards the Sun, scientists will observe its changes during the closest approach on October 29. The comet will not be visible from Earth again until mid-November, when further observations will be conducted to study its evolution, particularly its gas jet and tail.</p>
