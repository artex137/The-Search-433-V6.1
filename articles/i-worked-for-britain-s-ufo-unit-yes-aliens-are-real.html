      <h2>I worked for Britain’s UFO unit. Yes, aliens are real</h2>

<p>Nick Pope, a former investigator for the UK Ministry of Defence’s UFO Desk, has stated that some unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) he investigated defy conventional explanation. He shared his insights following remarks from former U.S. President Barack Obama, who claimed in a podcast that “they’re real.” Obama later clarified that he meant we are unlikely to be alone in the universe, stating he had seen no evidence of extraterrestrial contact during his presidency.</p>

<p>This discussion around UFOs and potential extraterrestrial life has gained renewed attention. The Pentagon established an office to investigate UAPs, marking a shift in official interest in the subject. Recent events, including Congressional hearings and whistleblower testimonies, have further intensified scrutiny of UFO sightings.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Nick Pope worked for the Ministry of Defence from 1991 to 1994.</li>
    <li>Obama made his comments in a podcast interview released on February 18, 2026.</li>
    <li>The Rendlesham Forest incident occurred in December 1980.</li>
    <li>A wave of UFO sightings took place in March 1993 across the UK.</li>
    <li>Military pilots have reported encounters with UAPs, some corroborated by radar data.</li>
    <li>UAP is the official government term for UFOs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In December 1980, the Rendlesham Forest incident involved U.S. Air Force personnel reporting sightings of a small metallic craft. The activity lasted three nights and included witnesses such as Deputy Base Commander Lieutenant Colonel Charles Halt.</p>
<p>In March 1993, a significant wave of UFO sightings occurred across the UK, with military witnesses observing a triangular-shaped craft that accelerated rapidly.</p>
<p>In May 2023, officials from the UK Ministry of Defence attended a Five Eyes intelligence meeting focused on UFOs, indicating a growing official interest in the phenomenon.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. Really!”</blockquote>
<p>- Barack Obama</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The topic of UFOs has shifted from fringe to mainstream in recent years, particularly in the U.S. The Pentagon's establishment of a dedicated office for UAP investigations and Congressional hearings have marked significant changes in how the government addresses the subject. High-profile figures, including Senator Marco Rubio and former Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, have actively pursued this issue.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into UAP sightings are ongoing, with continued Congressional interest and potential future disclosures from the Pentagon. The engagement from high-ranking officials suggests that further developments in this area may be forthcoming.</p>
