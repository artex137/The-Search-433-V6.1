      <h2>Top 8 countries using ground telescopes to study 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>As interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS travels through the Solar System, astronomers from eight countries are observing and documenting its behaviour. The comet is currently being tracked by various observatories, with significant contributions from facilities in the United States, Spain, India, Japan, Chile, Italy, France, and Australia.</p>

<p>This international collaboration is vital for understanding the comet's composition and trajectory. Observatories are using advanced technology to gather high-resolution data, which helps scientists analyze the comet's chemical makeup and monitor changes in its tail and coma.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is currently being observed globally.</li>
    <li>The US leads with facilities like the Keck Observatory in Hawaii and Lowell Observatory in Arizona.</li>
    <li>Spain's Gran Telescopio Canarias is known for its clear skies and detailed imagery.</li>
    <li>India's Indian Astronomical Observatory in Ladakh is among the highest observatories in the world.</li>
    <li>Chile's Atacama Desert houses several top observatories, including ESO's Very Large Telescope.</li>
    <li>Japan's Subaru Telescope, operated by the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan, is providing early imaging.</li>
    <li>Italy's Asiago Astrophysical Observatory focuses on the comet's dust composition.</li>
    <li>France's Observatoire de Haute-Provence and Pic du Midi Observatory are involved in monitoring campaigns.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has been observed since its discovery. The Keck Observatory and Lowell Observatory in the US have been tracking its movements in real time. Spanish astronomers began releasing detailed imagery soon after, aiding trajectory mapping. India joined the observation network with facilities in Ladakh and Pune, contributing unique data. Japan's Subaru Telescope provided early imaging, while Chilean observatories captured long-duration exposures. Italian and French observatories have also joined the efforts, focusing on specific aspects of the comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The collaboration among international observatories has allowed us to gather critical data on 3I/ATLAS,” said a representative from NASA.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The study of comets like 3I/ATLAS is essential for understanding the formation of our Solar System. Previous comets have provided valuable insights into the early materials that made up planetary bodies. The ongoing observations from multiple countries reflect a growing trend in collaborative astronomical research.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Observatories will continue monitoring 3I/ATLAS as it progresses through the Solar System. Scientists are expected to share findings and data, contributing to a better understanding of the comet's characteristics and trajectory.</p>
