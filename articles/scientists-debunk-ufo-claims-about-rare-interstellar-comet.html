      <h2>Scientists debunk UFO claims about rare interstellar comet</h2>

<p>Researchers at Michigan State University have clarified that a recently discovered interstellar comet, known as 3I/Atlas, is not a UFO, despite online speculation. The comet has displayed typical characteristics of cometary activity, according to Professor Daryll Seligman, the lead author of the study.</p>

<p>This clarification matters as it addresses public interest and concern regarding the origins of the comet. Authorities, including the scientific community, are emphasizing the need for accurate information amidst widespread rumors about extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/Atlas</li>
    <li><strong>Lead Researcher:</strong> Professor Daryll Seligman</li>
    <li><strong>University:</strong> Michigan State University</li>
    <li><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Displays typical comet features, including a tail</li>
    <li><strong>Visibility:</strong> Observable with a telescope in August, September, November, and December</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas was first spotted moving beyond the region where water is active, indicating that its nucleus likely contains a different type of ice. Researchers have been studying its properties to understand its origins and composition.</p>

<p>Professor Seligman noted that the comet is unique as it is the third interstellar comet ever detected. The findings about its ice composition suggest that it may provide insights into the system from which it originated.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Almost everybody in the field is in agreement that this object is a natural comet because it’s displaying classical evidence of cometary activity,” said Professor Daryll Seligman.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“There’s no controversy about it not being a comet because nobody thinks that except a very few people,” Seligman added.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“As it’s coming by the Sun, it’s sublimating material just like any other comet would,” said Shannon Schmoll, director of the Abrams Planetarium.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Everything about this points to it being a comet from somewhere else in the galaxy,” Schmoll concluded.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/Atlas follows the detection of two other interstellar comets, raising interest in the study of celestial objects from outside our solar system. Previous claims about UFO sightings have often been met with skepticism from the scientific community, which emphasizes evidence-based research.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to study 3I/Atlas as it becomes more visible in the coming months, aiming to gather more data on its composition and behavior.</p>
