      <h2>New Hubble images reveal symmetric jets in the 3I/ATLAS object and intensify debate about their origin</h2>

<p>New observations of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, captured by the Hubble Space Telescope on January 14, 2026, have revealed features that intensify the debate about its true nature. The findings are part of an analysis led by astrophysicist Avi Loeb from Harvard University.</p>

<p>The images show a system of jets with precise geometric symmetry, a pattern rarely associated with natural comets. This discovery raises questions about whether 3I/ATLAS could be of technological origin, although most scientists continue to classify it as a typical celestial body. The object, which follows a retrograde trajectory, is set to approach Jupiter in March 2026, prompting astronomers worldwide to monitor its path closely.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Observation date: January 14, 2026</li>
    <li>Lead researcher: Avi Loeb, Harvard University</li>
    <li>Next significant event: Approach to Jupiter in March 2026</li>
    <li>Alignment probability with planets: 0.2%</li>
    <li>Diameter estimate: between 2 and 6 kilometers (according to Russian President Vladimir Putin)</li>
    <li>Monitoring by global observatories ongoing</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in 2025 and quickly attracted attention due to its unusual retrograde orbit and various orbital coincidences. Observations in July 2025 indicated the presence of a highly collimated jet. After perihelion, this structure persisted, challenging conventional cometary behavior.</p>
<p>The latest images, processed using a technique known as Larson-Sekanina, revealed an extraordinarily ordered pattern, including three equidistant jets and an antitail pointing at the Sun. The observations have sparked discussions about the object's potential artificial origin among some experts.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The geometric configuration is one of the strongest indications that 3I/ATLAS may not be a simple comet, but something designed with a specific purpose,” said Avi Loeb during a press briefing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“It does not pose any threat to Earth,” stated Russian President Vladimir Putin, attributing the object's unusual features to its extragalactic origin.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Official confirmation of extraterrestrial intelligence could trigger a wave of social unrest and panic in markets,” warned Helen McCaw, a former analyst.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The scientific community has maintained a conservative stance regarding 3I/ATLAS, categorizing it as an interstellar comet with atypical characteristics that can be explained by natural phenomena. The object’s approach to Jupiter will be closely monitored, with ongoing discussions about its implications for understanding interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey out of the Solar System, observatories worldwide will maintain constant monitoring. The scientific community anticipates the operation of new instruments, such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, which is expected to improve the detection of interstellar objects in the coming decade.</p>
