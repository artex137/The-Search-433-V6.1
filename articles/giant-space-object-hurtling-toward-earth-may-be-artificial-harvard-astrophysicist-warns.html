      <h2>Giant space object hurtling toward Earth may be artificial, Harvard astrophysicist warns</h2>

<p>A giant mass named 3I/ATLAS is heading toward Earth, and Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has suggested it may be an extraterrestrial craft. The object, which is currently traveling at nearly 140,000 miles per hour, has sparked debate in the scientific community regarding its true nature.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as it raises questions about the origins of the object and what it could mean for future investigations. Loeb’s peers believe 3I/ATLAS is a frozen comet releasing carbon dioxide gas, but Loeb argues that its unique flight path indicates it may have been artificially created. Authorities are monitoring the situation as the object approaches Mars, where it is expected to come close enough for photographs to be taken by a Mars-orbiting camera.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Nearly 140,000 miles per hour</li>
    <li><strong>Potential Arrival at Mars:</strong> Late September</li>
    <li><strong>Astrophysicist:</strong> Avi Loeb from Harvard</li>
    <li><strong>Observation:</strong> Hubble Space Telescope captured images on July 21</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 21, the Hubble Space Telescope took images of 3I/ATLAS, revealing that the object appeared to generate its own light. Avi Loeb has since published a paper outlining his theory that there is a precursor mini-probe accompanying the comet. This mini-probe, approximately 300 feet long, is theorized to be undetectable by Earth-bound telescopes.</p>

<p>According to Loeb, the mini-probe is expected to reach Mars around the same time as 3I/ATLAS, potentially a week earlier. If any material from 3I/ATLAS reaches Mars, it would suggest that the object is artificial, challenging the notion that it is merely a natural comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, “If anything from 3I/ATLAS does reach Mars, it would suggest the object is artificial, like a spacecraft or probe, rather than a natural object.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discussion around 3I/ATLAS follows a trend in space exploration where scientists are increasingly considering the possibility of non-natural objects in our solar system. Previous incidents involving unidentified aerial phenomena have also fueled public and scientific interest in the search for extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Mars, scientists will continue to monitor its trajectory and gather data. Observations from space telescopes will be critical in determining the object’s nature and whether it supports the theory of artificial origins.</p>
