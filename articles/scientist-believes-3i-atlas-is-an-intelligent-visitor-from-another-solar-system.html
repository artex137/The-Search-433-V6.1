      <h2>Scientist believes 3I/Atlas is ‘an intelligent visitor from another solar system’</h2>

<p>Professor Michio Kaku, a theoretical physicist at the City College of New York, has proposed that the interstellar object 3I/Atlas could be an "intelligent visitor from another solar system." Kaku made this statement during an interview with NEWSMAX, noting that the object is expected to pass near the Sun on October 29 to 30, 2025.</p>

<p>This theory has gained attention as NASA has added 3I/Atlas to its International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN), classifying it as a potential "planetary threat." Authorities are closely monitoring the object to determine if it exhibits unusual behavior as it approaches the Sun, which could indicate it is not a natural comet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/Atlas</li>
    <li>Detected: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Speed: Approximately 130,000 mph</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun: October 29-30, 2025</li>
    <li>NASA classification: Possible planetary threat</li>
    <li>Current assessment by Dr. Avi Loeb: 30-40% likelihood of non-natural origin</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, 3I/Atlas was detected as it traveled towards Earth. As it nears the Sun, scientists have noted that it may exhibit an increase in speed due to the gravitational assist from the Sun. This phenomenon, known as the Oberth effect, has prompted scientists to monitor the object closely.</p>

<p>On October 29-30, 2025, 3I/Atlas will reach its closest point to the Sun. Observations during this time could provide critical data regarding its behavior and composition.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Perhaps this is a visitor, an intelligent visitor from another solar system,” said Professor Michio Kaku during his interview.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“If so, it means we are being visited,” Kaku added, referring to the possibility of extra energy being picked up during the flyby.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Dr. Avi Loeb stated, “As of now, I assign a 30 to 40 per cent likelihood that 3I/ATLAS does not have a fully natural origin.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The classification of 3I/Atlas as a potential planetary threat is part of a broader effort by NASA and international space agencies to monitor interstellar objects. Previous incidents involving unidentified objects have raised questions regarding their origins and potential implications for Earth.</p>

<p>Dr. Loeb has suggested a "Loeb Scale" for evaluating interstellar objects, where a score of 0 indicates a natural object and 10 indicates a technological object. He currently rates 3I/Atlas at a 6, pending further observations.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to observe 3I/Atlas as it approaches the Sun. Data collected during this time will be crucial for determining its nature and potential risks associated with it. Further assessments will be made based on its behavior and any changes in its trajectory.</p>
