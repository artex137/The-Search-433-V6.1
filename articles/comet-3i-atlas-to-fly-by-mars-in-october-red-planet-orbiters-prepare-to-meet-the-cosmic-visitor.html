      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS to fly by Mars in October: Red planet orbiters prepare to meet the cosmic visitor</h2>

<p>In early October 2025, comet 3I/ATLAS will pass within 30 million kilometers of Mars, offering a unique opportunity for observation. The European Space Agency (ESA) is preparing its Martian orbiters to study this interstellar object, which was discovered on July 1, 2025.</p>

<p>The close approach of 3I/ATLAS is significant for scientists as it allows them to study the comet's structure and composition. ESA plans to utilize its Mars Express and ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) to gather data during the comet's closest approach on October 3, 2025.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS (officially C/2025 N1) discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Mars is on October 3, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet will be 30 million kilometers from Mars.</li>
    <li>ESA's Mars Express and ExoMars TGO will conduct observations.</li>
    <li>NASA's MAVEN and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter may also participate.</li>
    <li>James Webb Space Telescope has already captured images of the comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by an international team using the ATLAS telescope system. Following its discovery, scientists have prepared for the comet's approach to Mars, where it will pass at a record close distance.</p>
<p>On October 3, 2025, the comet will make its closest approach, allowing ESA's Mars orbiters to observe its shape and activity, contributing valuable data to the scientific community.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We plan to observe 3I/ATLAS during its closest approach to Mars on October 3,” said Colin Frank Wilson, ESA’s lead scientist for Mars orbiter missions.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object detected in our Solar System, following 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Its observation may provide insights into the chemical makeup and formation conditions of distant stars.</p>
<p>Unlike previous interstellar objects, 3I/ATLAS offers a chance to study a different type of interstellar body, which may reveal more about the diversity of such objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>After the flyby on October 3, 2025, ESA and its partners will continue to gather data from various spacecraft, including JUICE and Europa Clipper, as the comet travels further into the Solar System. This ongoing research will enhance understanding of interstellar objects and their significance in the cosmos.</p>
