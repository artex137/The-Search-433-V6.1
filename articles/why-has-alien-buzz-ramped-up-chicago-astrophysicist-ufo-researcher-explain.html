      <h2>Why has alien ‘buzz’ ramped up? Chicago astrophysicist, UFO researcher explain</h2>

<p>Recent comments from two former U.S. presidents regarding extraterrestrial life have increased public interest in UFOs. Barack Obama stated, “Yes, but I haven’t seen them,” while Donald Trump directed the government to identify and release files related to alien life.</p>

<p>This surge in interest is significant as it coincides with ongoing Congressional investigations into unidentified aerial phenomena and the release of new media, including Steven Spielberg’s upcoming film "Disclosure Day." Authorities and researchers are now emphasizing the need for serious study into these phenomena.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Barack Obama acknowledged the possibility of aliens in a recent interview.</li>
    <li>Donald Trump has called for the release of government files on extraterrestrial life.</li>
    <li>Ongoing Congressional investigations are examining unidentified aerial phenomena.</li>
    <li>Mark Rodeghier works with Chicago's Center for UFO Studies.</li>
    <li>NASA's James Webb Telescope has been used to study planetary atmospheres.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In a recent interview, former President Barack Obama responded to a question about aliens, affirming their potential existence but clarifying he has not seen proof. Following this, former President Donald Trump commented on Obama's statements, suggesting he revealed classified information. Trump has since directed the government to begin releasing files on extraterrestrial life.</p>

<p>Simultaneously, the field of UFO research has gained legitimacy, particularly after the U.S. government acknowledged documenting unexplained sightings by military pilots. This development has led to increased media coverage and public interest in UFOs.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It’s a scientific mystery of the deepest sense,” said Mark Rodeghier, a longtime UFO researcher.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“We’re really widening our search for where life could be,” said University of Chicago astrophysicist Jacob Bean regarding the use of NASA's James Webb Telescope.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discussion surrounding UFOs has evolved, particularly after government revelations on military sightings. The field, once seen as fringe, is now attracting serious academic and political attention due to its potential implications for understanding life beyond Earth.</p>

<p>In addition to governmental investigations, the public is also seeing a rise in media portrayals of the subject, such as the upcoming film "Disclosure Day," which is expected to further amplify interest.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into unidentified aerial phenomena are ongoing, with Congressional committees expected to continue their inquiries. Researchers like Bean will further utilize advanced tools like the James Webb Telescope to search for signs of life on other planets.</p>
