      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Leaves Hidden Particle Trail, Scientists Plan to Intercept It</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has produced a secondary trail of charged particles as it travels through the solar system, prompting scientists from the European Space Agency (ESA) to propose a plan to send NASA’s Europa Clipper and ESA’s Hera spacecraft through this ion tail. This proposal comes as the comet approaches its perihelion on October 29, 2025, and the potential alignment of the spacecraft’s paths occurs between October 30 and November 6, 2025.</p>

<p>The research, led by ESA scientists Samuel Grant and Geraint Jones, suggests that this unique opportunity could allow the spacecraft to collect samples of material ejected by 3I/ATLAS. This encounter may provide the first indirect observations of material from another star system, offering insights into the composition of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is currently far from Earth, producing a hidden trail of charged particles.</li>
  <li>The proposed spacecraft encounters are scheduled between October 30 and November 6, 2025.</li>
  <li>Europa Clipper may pass through the ion tail and collect data on October 30.</li>
  <li>Hera spacecraft may enter the ion tail between October 25 and November 1, 2025.</li>
  <li>3I/ATLAS will reach perihelion on October 29, 2025.</li>
  <li>Grant and Jones have developed a model called Tailcatcher to track solar wind interactions with comets.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In October 2025, as 3I/ATLAS approaches the Sun, both the Europa Clipper and Hera spacecraft are positioned to potentially intersect with the comet's ion tail. The following events outline the key dates:</p>
<ul>
  <li>October 25 - November 1, 2025: Hera spacecraft may enter the ion tail of 3I/ATLAS.</li>
  <li>October 29, 2025: 3I/ATLAS reaches perihelion, increasing its activity and widening the ion tail.</li>
  <li>October 30 - November 6, 2025: Europa Clipper may collect data as it passes through the ion tail.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“During the period 30 October – 6 November 2025, it is predicted that Europa Clipper will potentially be immersed within the ion tail of 3I/ATLAS, providing the opportunity to detect the signatures of an interstellar comet’s ion tail,” wrote Samuel Grant and Geraint Jones in their paper.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Characteristic changes to the solar wind are also expected to be observed,” they added, noting the potential for a “magnetic draping structure” associated with the comet.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable for its interstellar origins, distinguishing it from comets within our solar system. Previous interstellar comets, such as 2I/Borisov and 1I/Oumuamua, have also provided limited data due to their rarity. Observations of 3I/ATLAS have been challenging, particularly amidst the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, which has affected the release of significant data from NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the scheduled dates for the spacecraft encounters approach, scientists will monitor the solar winds and prepare for potential data collection. The successful activation of Europa Clipper’s scientific instruments will be crucial for gathering valuable information about the ion tail of 3I/ATLAS.</p>
