      <h2>Late eruption of interstellar comet reveals methanol and carbon-rich structure after perihelion</h2>

<p>A late eruption of the interstellar comet 3I ATLAS has revealed a methanol and carbon-rich structure following its perihelion on February 1, 2026. The discovery was made by astronomers at the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in Chile during observations of the comet's activity.</p>

<p>This finding is significant as it provides insights into the composition of interstellar comets and their potential to contribute to our understanding of the early solar system. Researchers are currently analyzing the data to better understand the implications of this eruption for future studies of similar celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I ATLAS erupted on February 1, 2026.</li>
    <li>The eruption revealed methanol and carbon-rich materials.</li>
    <li>Observations were conducted by the European Southern Observatory in Chile.</li>
    <li>The comet is classified as an interstellar object.</li>
    <li>Further analysis is ongoing to understand the eruption's implications.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On February 1, 2026, comet 3I ATLAS reached its perihelion, the point in its orbit closest to the Sun. Shortly after this event, astronomers at the ESO detected a significant eruption of material from the comet.</p>

<p>Following the eruption, researchers began studying the composition of the expelled materials, focusing on the presence of methanol and carbon compounds. This analysis is expected to enhance our understanding of the comet's origin and its role in the solar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The eruption of 3I ATLAS gives us a unique opportunity to study the composition of an interstellar comet,” said Dr. Maria Gonzalez, an astronomer at the ESO. “Understanding these materials can help us learn more about the building blocks of our solar system.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interstellar comets, like 3I ATLAS, are rare and provide valuable information about the materials that exist outside our solar system. Previous studies of similar comets have revealed diverse compositions, but 3I ATLAS's methanol and carbon-rich structure adds a new layer to our understanding.</p>

<p>Comet 3I ATLAS was first detected in 2023 and has been the subject of ongoing research since its discovery.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze the data from the eruption and plan to publish their findings in upcoming scientific journals. The implications of this eruption for understanding interstellar bodies are expected to be discussed at future astronomical conferences.</p>
