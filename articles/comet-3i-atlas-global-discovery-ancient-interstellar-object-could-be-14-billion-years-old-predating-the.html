      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Global Discovery: Ancient Interstellar Object Could Be 14 Billion Years Old</h2>

<p>Mumbai, January 5: The Comet 3I Atlas Interstellar Object, the third confirmed comet detected in our solar system, has begun its journey back into deep space after its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025. Discovered in July 2025, the comet passed within approximately 270 million kilometres of our planet.</p>

<p>Astronomers are currently observing the comet as it speeds towards a scheduled encounter with Jupiter’s orbit in March 2026. The Comet 3I Atlas, unlike its predecessors, has provided significant data due to its high activity and trackable trajectory near Mars and Venus. It could be up to 14 billion years old, possibly predating the Sun, offering insights into the early universe.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered: July 2025</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth at closest approach: Approximately 270 million kilometres</li>
    <li>Upcoming closest approach to Jupiter: March 16, 2026, at a distance of 53.6 million kilometres</li>
    <li>Current speed: Roughly 250,000 km/h</li>
    <li>Expected fading beyond ground-based telescopes: Spring 2026</li>
    <li>Projected arrival at the inner Oort Cloud: Year 2189</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>July 2025: The Comet 3I Atlas Interstellar Object is discovered.</p>
<p>December 19, 2025: The comet makes its closest approach to Earth, passing at approximately 270 million kilometres.</p>
<p>January 2026: Data from the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) reveals the comet's high activity, with water being expelled at a peak rate of 3.17 × 10<sup>29</sup> molecules per second.</p>
<p>January 3, 2026: The Breakthrough Listen project confirms no artificial signals were detected from the comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Astronomers have noted that the Comet 3I Atlas offers a rare glimpse into the early universe, with its age and composition providing valuable insights into pre-solar system conditions.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Comet 3I Atlas Interstellar Object is categorized as one of the "elders" of our cosmic neighbourhood. Studies indicate it originated from the Milky Way's "thick disk," a region populated by stars significantly older than our Sun. This suggests the comet could be over 7 billion years old, providing a pristine sample of a planetary system that formed billions of years before our own.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to observe the Comet 3I Atlas as it approaches Jupiter in March 2026 and will monitor its visibility as it fades from view in the spring.</p>
