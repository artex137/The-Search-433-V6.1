      <h2>One of NASA's top scientists discusses object 3I/ATLAS and responds to theory that it is an alien spacecraft: "It looks very much like it"</h2>

<p>On July 1, the ATLAS (Advanced Technology Large-Aperture Space) telescope discovered comet 3I/ATLAS, marking it as the third object from outside the solar system identified to date, according to NASA. The agency has stated that the comet does not pose a threat to Earth, as its closest approach will be approximately 270 million kilometers away.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as astronomers are working to gather information about the interstellar object. Although it ceased to be visible in September due to its proximity to the Sun, it is expected to be observable again in early December. The comet will reach its closest point to the Sun on October 30, 2025, at a distance of around 210 million kilometers.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered on July 1 by the ATLAS telescope.</li>
    <li>It is the third interstellar object identified to date.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth will be approximately 270 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>Closest point to the Sun is expected on October 30, 2025, at about 210 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>Visibility ceased in September; it will be observable again in early December.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the ATLAS telescope identified comet 3I/ATLAS. NASA classified it as an interstellar object due to its hyperbolic orbital path. In September, the comet became too close to the Sun to be seen. It is anticipated to reappear in early December.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It looks like a comet. It does comet-like things. It looks very much, in almost every respect, like the comets we know,” said Tom Statler, a leading NASA scientist for small bodies in the Solar System.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Abraham 'Avi' Loeb, an Israeli-American theoretical physicist, suggested in his blog that 3I/ATLAS could be a hostile interstellar probe sent by an intelligent species, warning, “The consequences, if the hypothesis turns out to be correct, could potentially be dire for humanity and would possibly require the adoption of defensive measures.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of comet 3I/ATLAS follows previous instances of interstellar objects being identified, with astronomers continually monitoring such phenomena to understand their origins and trajectories. The ongoing interest in the potential for extraterrestrial life has led to speculation about interstellar objects, making statements from credible scientists crucial for public understanding.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to observe comet 3I/ATLAS as it becomes visible again in December, gathering data to enhance understanding of interstellar objects.</p>
