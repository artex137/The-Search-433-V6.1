      <h2>3I/ATLAS is spinning? New footage raises questions about interstellar comet</h2>

<p>New footage of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has surfaced online, prompting questions about its spinning motion. The images, which include contributions from Ray’s Astrophotography, NASA updates, and ESA observations, have sparked discussions among space enthusiasts. These claims about the comet's motion remain unverified.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as 3I/ATLAS is passing through the solar system for the first and only time. Astronomers are awaiting new images from NASA to help confirm the claims made in the recent footage. The comet is currently on a hyperbolic path and poses no threat to Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovery:</strong> 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the NASA-funded ATLAS survey telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile.</li>
    <li><strong>Origin:</strong> It is confirmed to have come from outside the solar system.</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> The comet travels at more than 210,000 kilometres per hour.</li>
    <li><strong>Visibility:</strong> It will be visible in the early morning sky through November and December.</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach:</strong> The comet passed close to Mars at a distance of about 29 million kilometres between October 2 and 3, 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has followed a significant path through the solar system since its discovery:</p>
<ul>
    <li>July 1, 2025: 3I/ATLAS is discovered by the ATLAS survey telescope.</li>
    <li>October 2-3, 2025: The comet makes its closest approach to Mars at approximately 29 million kilometres.</li>
    <li>October 30, 2025: 3I/ATLAS passes its closest approach to the Sun and begins to move back into the night sky.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The claims about 3I/ATLAS's spinning motion remain unverified, but they have created discussion among space watchers,” said a NASA spokesperson.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“We expect new images from NASA to help confirm what these early captures show,” noted an ESA representative.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object passing through the solar system, following 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Its hyperbolic orbit indicates that it will not return after its passage.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers are set to compare the recent footage and claims with upcoming NASA data to verify the details of 3I/ATLAS. Observations from ESA’s JUICE spacecraft are expected between November 2 and 25, with further data to arrive in 2026.</p>
