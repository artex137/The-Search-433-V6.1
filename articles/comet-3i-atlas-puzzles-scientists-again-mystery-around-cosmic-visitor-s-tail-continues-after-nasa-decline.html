      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS puzzles scientists again: Mystery around cosmic visitor's tail continues after NASA decline</h2>

<p>Scientists have closely monitored the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS after it exhibited unusual behavior following its closest approach to the Sun on October 29. The comet passed perihelion at a distance of 203 million kilometers from the Sun, and new observations reveal that it is glowing green while appearing to hide its tail, according to researcher Qicheng Zhang from Lowell Observatory in Arizona.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it raises questions about the comet's characteristics and behavior. Authorities and researchers are continuing to analyze the comet to understand its properties, while discussions around its potential origins have intensified, particularly regarding claims of possible extraterrestrial features.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS passed perihelion on October 29, 2023.</li>
    <li>Distance from the Sun at perihelion: 203 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>Observations conducted by Qicheng Zhang on November 5, 2023.</li>
    <li>Comet appears to lack a visible dust tail, which is reportedly normal.</li>
    <li>Chinese Tianwen-1 orbiter captured images of 3I/ATLAS during its flyby of Mars.</li>
    <li>NASA has not released certain data regarding the comet, causing speculation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2023. On October 29, it passed its closest point to the Sun. Following this event, on November 5, researcher Qicheng Zhang observed the comet using the Discovery Telescope, noting its unusual green glow and the apparent absence of a tail.</p>

<p>Previously, on October 1-4, images of 3I/ATLAS were captured by the Tianwen-1 orbiter, showcasing its movement across the cosmos. The orbiter's mission aimed to maximize imaging of this faint target.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The UV rays are destroying our DNA [in our skin cells], which is kind of a similar type of molecule in the sense that it's big and contains carbon,” Zhang explained, discussing the effects of sunlight on the comet's molecules.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “Based on this observational data, researchers are conducting further in-depth studies of ATLAS,” the China National Space Administration (CNSA) stated, emphasizing the importance of the recent observations.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “I write to request the release of specific observational data related to 3I/ATLAS, recently captured by NASA missions,” said GOP Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, highlighting the need for transparency regarding the comet's data.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Since its discovery, 3I/ATLAS has attracted attention due to its unique characteristics. Some scientists, including astrophysicist Avi Loeb, have suggested that the comet exhibits behaviors that could indicate it is an extraterrestrial probe. These claims have sparked debates within the scientific community regarding the nature of interstellar objects.</p>

<p>The controversy surrounding the lack of data released by NASA has led to calls for more transparency, as researchers aim to understand the implications of 3I/ATLAS for our knowledge of interstellar visitors.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to study the data collected from various observations of 3I/ATLAS. There are ongoing discussions about the release of additional NASA data, which could provide further insights into the comet's behavior and characteristics.</p>
