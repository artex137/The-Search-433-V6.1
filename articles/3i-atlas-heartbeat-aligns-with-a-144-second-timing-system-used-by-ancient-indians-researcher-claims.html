      <h2>3I/ATLAS 'heartbeat' aligns with a 144-second timing system used by ancient Indians, researcher claims</h2>

<p>3I/ATLAS, an interstellar comet, has been observed pulsing every 15.48 hours, according to researcher Andrew Collins. He claims this “heartbeat” aligns with ancient Chinese clock systems and Indian meditation practices. The comet is currently nearing its closest point to Earth, prompting scientists to note its unusual behavior.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it raises questions about the comet's nature and origins. Collins suggests that the pulsing pattern may not be a coincidence but rather indicative of intelligent design. NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), and other astronomers have dismissed these claims, asserting that 3I/ATLAS is a typical comet exhibiting standard behavior.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is currently exhibiting a pulsing cycle of 15.48 hours.</li>
    <li>Collins claims this aligns with a 144-second timing system used by ancient Chinese and Indian cultures.</li>
    <li>Initial observations recorded rhythmic bursts every 16.16 hours after its discovery.</li>
    <li>Collins' findings are based on data from Spain's Two-meter Twin Telescope.</li>
    <li>NASA and ESA maintain that 3I/ATLAS is a regular comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Shortly after its discovery, 3I/ATLAS exhibited rhythmic bursts every 16.16 hours. Recent data from September indicated a change in this pulsing pattern, now measured at 15.48 hours. Collins has analyzed this data alongside historical timing systems used by ancient civilizations.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The many anomalies associated with 3I/ATLAS strongly hint that it is not a mundane comet but what might be described as a directed comet,” said Collins in his paper submitted to ResearchGate.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous studies have highlighted anomalies surrounding 3I/ATLAS, leading some researchers to speculate about its true nature. Collins cites the work of Harvard scientist Avi Loeb, who has raised similar questions regarding the comet's characteristics.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further observations and analysis are expected as 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth. Researchers will continue to monitor its behavior, while NASA and ESA remain firm in their assertion that it is a standard comet.</p>
