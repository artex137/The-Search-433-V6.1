      <h2>Mysterious interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has no tail: What 2 experts say that mean</h2>

<p>Scientists have been monitoring 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar comet, closely since it passed its closest point to the sun on October 29, 2023. The comet came within 203 million kilometers of the sun, according to Harvard theoretical physicist Dr. Avi Loeb. It has shown unusual behavior, including a lack of a cometary tail, which is unexpected for an object at such proximity to the sun.</p>

<p>This phenomenon raises questions about the object's composition and origin. Authorities, including astronomers and researchers, are gathering data to understand more about 3I/ATLAS and its potential implications for our understanding of interstellar objects. Scientists hope to uncover insights that could inform future research on similar celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS passed perihelion on October 29, 2023.</li>
    <li>It came within 203 million kilometers of the sun.</li>
    <li>The comet will be closest to Earth on December 19, 2023.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object.</li>
    <li>It was discovered by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) survey team in Rio Hurtado, Chile.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 29, 2023, 3I/ATLAS passed its closest point to the sun, exhibiting non-gravitational acceleration and a change in color. Scientists noted the absence of a typical cometary tail in new images, which raised questions about its nature. Further observations are planned as the comet approaches Earth in December.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It came from the same direction as the ‘Wow’ signal that was discovered in 1977, a radio signal that is still enigmatic. We don’t know what the source is, but they were within nine degrees of each other. And the question is, were they related? Was this signal related to 3I/ATLAS in any way? So there are lots of anomalies,” Dr. Avi Loeb said.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“We would always start off with the assumption that these are natural objects and we would study them in that way. And if there’s really very powerful evidence that they’re not, then we might be led toward another direction,” Dr. Ken Gayley stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object, following 1I/Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. These objects provide valuable insights into the formation and evolution of different star systems. The unexpected characteristics of 3I/ATLAS could challenge existing theories about the nature of such celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth on December 19, scientists plan to gather more data to determine its true nature. They aim to gain valuable insights into interstellar objects and the conditions in which they formed.</p>
