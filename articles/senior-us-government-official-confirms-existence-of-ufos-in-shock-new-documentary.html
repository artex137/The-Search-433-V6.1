      <h2>Senior US government official confirms existence of UFOs in new documentary</h2>

<p>A senior US government official has confirmed the existence of UFOs in a trailer for an upcoming Prime Video documentary titled <strong>The Age of Disclosure</strong>. The trailer features interviews with multiple senior government officials, including Marco Rubio, the United States Secretary of State, and Jay Stratton, a retired Defense Intelligence Agency official. The documentary is set to release on November 21.</p>

<p>This revelation is significant as it suggests a long-standing belief that the existence of alien life has been covered up by the US government for decades. The documentary aims to address these claims and includes discussions about unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) observed over restricted military facilities.</p>
