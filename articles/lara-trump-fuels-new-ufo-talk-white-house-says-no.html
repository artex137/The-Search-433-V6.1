      <h2>Lara Trump Fuels New UFO Talk; White House Says No</h2>

<p>Lara Trump has claimed that her father-in-law, former President Donald Trump, has a prepared speech about extraterrestrial life that he is waiting to deliver at the "right time." This assertion, made on the "Pod Force One" podcast, has drawn a response from the White House, which stated it had not heard of such a speech.</p>

<p>The claim comes amidst increasing public interest in UFOs and unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP). The White House has stated that recent government findings indicate no evidence that the U.S. possesses alien technology. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt addressed the comments during a briefing, noting that the idea of a speech about aliens was new information to her.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Lara Trump made her comments on February 18, 2026.</li>
    <li>The remarks were made on the "Pod Force One" podcast.</li>
    <li>White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt responded to the claims during a Wednesday briefing.</li>
    <li>Former President Barack Obama has publicly joked about aliens but stated he has seen no evidence of extraterrestrial contact.</li>
    <li>Congress has shown renewed interest in UAP, including a House Oversight subcommittee hearing in July 2023.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On February 18, 2026, Lara Trump discussed her father-in-law's alleged speech about extraterrestrial life during the "Pod Force One" podcast. She mentioned that she and her husband, Eric Trump, had previously asked the former president about UFOs. In response to these claims, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated at a briefing that the speech idea was new to her and suggested she would check with the speech-writing team.</p>

<p>The comments from Lara Trump coincided with increased media attention on UFOs and UAP, particularly following remarks made by former President Obama on a podcast, where he joked about aliens. Obama clarified that he had not seen any evidence to substantiate claims of extraterrestrial contact.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "I've heard kind of around— I think my father-in-law has actually said it— that there is some speech that he has that I guess at the right time— I don't know when the right time is— he's going to break out and talk about, and it has to do with maybe some sort of extraterrestrial life," Lara Trump said.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    "I'll have to check in with our speech-writing team. And that would be of great interest to me personally, and I'm sure all of you in this room and apparently former President Obama, too," said Karoline Leavitt, addressing Lara Trump's comments.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This renewed focus on UFOs aligns with ongoing congressional interest in UAP, which includes discussions surrounding national security and public safety. A House Oversight subcommittee held a hearing in July 2023 to address these concerns, emphasizing the government’s commitment to transparency regarding unidentified phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As public interest continues, the White House may face further inquiries regarding the alleged speech and the broader implications of UAP. Investigations into UAP by congressional committees are expected to continue, with potential hearings and reports in the near future.</p>
