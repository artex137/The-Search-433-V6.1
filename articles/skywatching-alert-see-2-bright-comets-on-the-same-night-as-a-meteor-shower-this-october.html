      <h2>Skywatching Alert: Two Bright Comets to Appear with Meteor Shower in October</h2>

<p>Skywatchers can look forward to seeing two bright comets, Comet C/2025 R2 (SWAN) and Comet C/2025 A6 (Lemmon), on the same night as the Orionid meteor shower on October 21. The comets will be visible in the night sky, with SWAN R2 passing close to Mars after sunset, primarily from the Southern Hemisphere.</p>

<p>This astronomical event is significant as it presents a rare opportunity to see two comets bright enough to potentially be visible with the naked eye. Astronomers are monitoring the comets' brightness and trajectories, especially as Earth may pass through debris from SWAN R2, which could lead to a unique meteor shower around October 4-6.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet C/2025 R2 (SWAN) discovered on September 12, 2023, by NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory.</li>
    <li>Comet C/2025 A6 (Lemmon) discovered in January 2023 by the Mount Lemmon Survey.</li>
    <li>Both comets will be closest to Earth on October 21, 2023.</li>
    <li>SWAN R2 will be approximately 0.27 astronomical units (AU) from Earth.</li>
    <li>Lemmon will be about 0.60 AU from Earth on the same date.</li>
    <li>Peak visibility for both comets is expected from October 20-23, 2023.</li>
    <li>The Orionid meteor shower will peak on October 20-21, with about 20 meteors per hour.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On September 12, 2023, Comet C/2025 R2 (SWAN) was discovered. Three days later, it was classified as a comet by the International Astronomical Union. In January 2023, Comet C/2025 A6 (Lemmon) was discovered. Both comets will reach their closest approach to Earth on October 21, 2023. The Orionid meteor shower is expected to peak on October 20-21, 2023.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This is an exciting time for skywatchers as we have the potential for two bright comets visible in the night sky along with a meteor shower,” said an unnamed astronomer.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The appearance of these comets comes after the last bright comet visible to the naked eye, C/2020 F3 (NEOWISE), in the summer of 2020. The visibility of comets is often unpredictable, as their brightness can fluctuate due to their proximity to the sun.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to monitor the brightness and trajectories of both comets leading up to their closest approach on October 21. Skywatchers are encouraged to prepare for optimal viewing conditions during the peak of the Orionid meteor shower.</p>
