      <h2>'I Was Taken by Aliens While in Office': Ex Russian President Claims UFO Abduction; World Leaders 'Knew Truth'</h2>

<p>Former Russian president <strong>Kirsan Ilyumzinov</strong> has claimed he was abducted by aliens while in office, a statement he made during a podcast. The incident reportedly occurred in September 1997, when Ilyumzinov was serving as president of the Russian republic of Kalmykia.</p>

<p>This claim has drawn attention to the topic of UFOs and extraterrestrial encounters. Ilyumzinov has suggested that some global leaders were aware of similar incidents but chose to remain silent. His assertions have reignited discussions about the existence of UFOs and the potential knowledge of world leaders regarding extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date:</strong> September 1997</li>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> Moscow, Russia</li>
    <li><strong>Involvement:</strong> Kirsan Ilyumzinov, former president of Kalmykia</li>
    <li><strong>Witnesses:</strong> Chief of staff and colleagues</li>
    <li><strong>Duration of absence:</strong> Over one hour</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On the evening of the incident, Ilyumzinov returned to his apartment in Moscow after work. He switched on the television and prepared for sleep. He then reported seeing a glowing, translucent tube form outside his window.</p>
<p>After stepping into the tube, Ilyumzinov claims he was transported aboard a spacecraft, where he encountered beings resembling humans. He later vanished from his apartment, prompting concern from his colleagues who found his belongings still present.</p>
<p>After more than an hour of confusion, Ilyumzinov reportedly returned to his bedroom and casually mentioned his experience with aliens.</p>

    “There was something like a translucent pipe glowing, made of some matter. I was invited by them.” – Kirsan Ilyumzinov
</blockquote>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “Well, aliens took me.” – Kirsan Ilyumzinov, recalling his return to the apartment

<p>The discussion surrounding UFOs has gained traction recently, with various governments beginning to release previously classified information about unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>
