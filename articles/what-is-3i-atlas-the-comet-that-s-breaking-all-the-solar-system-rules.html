      <h2>What IS 3I/ATLAS: The Comet that’s breaking all the solar system rules</h2>

<p>A strange visitor, comet 3I/ATLAS, is currently passing through our Solar System, exhibiting unusual behaviours that challenge traditional comet theories. Observations have revealed features, including a tail pointing towards the Sun, which contradict established comet behaviour norms. There are no reports of injuries or fatalities associated with this celestial event.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it raises questions about our understanding of comet characteristics and origins. Scientists are closely monitoring 3I/ATLAS, which is the third known interstellar object following 1I/‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, to gain insights into its composition and behaviour as it approaches the Sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is travelling at approximately 57 kilometres per second.</li>
    <li>Its trajectory has an eccentricity of around 6, indicating it cannot be captured by the Sun's gravity.</li>
    <li>The nucleus diameter is estimated between 0.44 km and 5.6 km.</li>
    <li>It has displayed a sunward tail, contrary to typical comet behaviour.</li>
    <li>Observations show an unusual composition, with high CO₂ relative to H₂O and elevated nickel concentrations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been observed as it travels through the Solar System. Early observations revealed its hyperbolic trajectory and unusual tail behaviour. As it approached the Sun, scientists noted a pronounced sunward tail around 4 astronomical units (AU) from the Sun, which later transitioned to a more conventional antisolar direction. This behaviour has prompted further investigation into its composition and the processes affecting it.</p>

<p>In recent weeks, high-resolution imaging has revealed significant changes in the comet's tail dynamics as it gets closer to the Sun, providing critical data for scientists studying comet physics.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The sunward tail doesn’t mean this object is artificial; many natural processes can explain it,” said a physicist involved in the research. “But because the behaviour is rare and the model fits well, 3I/ATLAS gives us a real opportunity to test our understanding of comet physics.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior interstellar objects, such as 1I/‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have prompted discussions about the diversity and characteristics of celestial bodies from outside our Solar System. The unique features of 3I/ATLAS contribute to ongoing debates regarding the potential for alien technology and the natural origins of such objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches perihelion, scientists will continue to observe its tail evolution and dust production rates. These observations will help determine if the comet behaves according to known scientific principles or if new surprises await.</p>
