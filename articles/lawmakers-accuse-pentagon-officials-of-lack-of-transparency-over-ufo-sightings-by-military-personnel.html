      <h2>Lawmakers accuse Pentagon officials of ‘lack of transparency’ over UFO sightings by military personnel</h2>

<p>During a House hearing on September 9, 2025, lawmakers raised concerns about the Pentagon's transparency regarding unexplained aerial phenomena, following reports of military personnel observing unidentified flying objects (UFOs). The hearing featured testimony from veterans who described encounters with mysterious aircraft, including one instance where a missile failed to disable an unidentified orb off the coast of Yemen in October 2024.</p>

<p>The hearing, conducted by the House Oversight and Government Reform Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets, has underscored the need for accountability and transparency from defense officials. Lawmakers and witnesses have expressed frustration over the lack of access to evidence and reports related to UFO sightings, which they argue is a matter of national security.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of hearing: September 9, 2025</li>
    <li>Location: Washington, D.C.</li>
    <li>Witnesses: Air Force veteran Dylan Borland, Rep. Eric Burlison, Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, Rep. Jasmine Crockett</li>
    <li>Incident reported by Borland: Triangular aircraft sighted above Langley Air Force Base in 2012</li>
    <li>Video shown by Burlison: MQ-9 Reaper striking an unidentified orb in October 2024</li>
    <li>Agency involved: All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2012, Air Force veteran Dylan Borland reports witnessing a triangular aircraft while on duty at Langley Air Force Base. He claims the craft interfered with his phone and displayed unusual characteristics. In 2023, Borland is interviewed by AARO regarding the incident, but his claims are dismissed.</p>

<p>On October 2024, an MQ-9 Reaper drone strikes an unidentified orb off the coast of Yemen, which continues to fly after being hit. This event is presented as evidence during the House hearing in September 2025.</p>

<p>During the hearing, Borland describes facing retaliation from the Defense Department after reporting his UAP experience, including workplace blacklisting. Lawmakers express concern over the treatment of personnel who report similar sightings.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This craft interfered with my telephone, did not have any sound and the material it was made of appeared fluid or dynamic,” said Dylan Borland during his testimony.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Rep. Anna Paulina Luna stated, “The American people are not fragile and do not need to be shielded like children from reality.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>Rep. Eric Burlison emphasized, “I’m not going to speculate what it is. But the question is, why are we being blocked from this information?”</blockquote>

<blockquote>Rep. Jasmine Crockett remarked, “We need to ensure that people who come forward and make reports can do so without fear of retaliation.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This hearing is part of a broader effort by Congress to investigate reports of unidentified anomalous phenomena and ensure that military personnel are protected when they report sightings. AARO has been tasked with examining these reports, but has faced criticism for its handling and transparency regarding the findings.</p>

<p>Previous incidents involving UFO sightings have often been met with skepticism, leading to a culture of silence among military personnel. This hearing aims to challenge that culture and promote accountability within the Defense Department.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The task force plans to continue its investigation into UAP sightings and the treatment of military personnel who report them. Lawmakers are expected to advocate for greater transparency from the Pentagon and push for protections for whistleblowers in the military.</p>
