      <h2>3I/ATLAS Mystery: Harvard Scientist Avi Loeb Blasts $90M Bias Against 'Technological' Comet</h2>

<p>Harvard professor Avi Loeb has claimed that the first interstellar object detected in our solar system, known as 1I/'Oumuamua, may be a piece of alien technology rather than a natural celestial body. Loeb made these remarks during a recent interview, asserting that the scientific community's dismissal of his hypothesis reflects an "irrational" bias against innovative ideas.</p>

<p>This controversy is significant as it raises questions about the openness of scientific inquiry. Loeb argues that the prevailing attitudes within the astronomy community hinder the pursuit of groundbreaking discoveries, particularly in relation to extraterrestrial life. He has called for a reevaluation of funding priorities, which he claims currently favour traditional astronomical research over the exploration of advanced technology from other civilizations.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object name:</strong> 1I/'Oumuamua</li>
    <li><strong>Detected by:</strong> Pan-STARRS telescope in Hawaii</li>
    <li><strong>Year of discovery:</strong> 2017</li>
    <li><strong>Funding bias:</strong> £90 million (approximately $90 million) allocated to traditional astronomical surveys</li>
    <li><strong>Current position:</strong> Loeb advocates for open-minded scientific inquiry</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>1I/'Oumuamua was first detected by the Pan-STARRS telescope in Hawaii in 2017. Initially classified as a comet, it was later redefined as an asteroid due to the absence of a visible tail. The object exhibited unexpected acceleration as it moved away from the sun, prompting scientists to question its nature.</p>

<p>In his ongoing research, Avi Loeb has proposed that 1I/'Oumuamua may be a 'light sail' or a piece of alien technology, challenging the conventional explanations that involve outgassing. His assertions have sparked significant debate within the scientific community, leading to accusations of bias against his theories.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The dominant bias within the astronomy community is a form of conservatism, a fear of embracing anything that smacks of speculation, particularly when it comes to intelligent life,” said Professor Loeb.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Rather than engaging with the evidence, many astronomers immediately dismissed my work as ‘sensationalist’ or ‘not serious’,” he added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The debate surrounding 1I/'Oumuamua is not new; it reflects a broader tension within the scientific community regarding the acceptance of unconventional ideas. Historical figures like Galileo and Copernicus faced similar resistance when proposing theories that challenged established norms.</p>

<p>Loeb's claims highlight a growing concern about academic conservatism, where researchers may avoid speculative inquiries due to potential repercussions for their careers and funding opportunities.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Professor Loeb continues to advocate for a more open-minded approach to scientific inquiry. His work aims to challenge the existing biases and encourage the exploration of all possibilities regarding extraterrestrial life and technology.</p>
