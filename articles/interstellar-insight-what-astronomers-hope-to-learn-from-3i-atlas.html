      <h2>Interstellar insight: What astronomers hope to learn from 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is currently traveling through our solar system at speeds reaching 67.1 kilometers per second, or 200 times the speed of sound. The comet will pass the Sun at the end of October 2025, marking its grand exit from the solar system. Astronomers globally, including those in Champaign-Urbana, are eager to study the comet to gain insights into the origins of our solar system and the universe.</p>

<p>This comet presents a unique opportunity for research, as interstellar objects like 3I/ATLAS provide free samples from beyond our solar system. Aidan Berres, a Ph.D. student in astronomy at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, emphasized the importance of understanding such celestial bodies to answer key questions about the formation of stars and planets.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered in July 2025.</li>
    <li>Comet will reach maximum speed of 67.1 km/s at perihelion in late October.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third observed interstellar object after 1I/’Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov.</li>
    <li>European Space Agency's ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter observed the comet from 30 million kilometers away.</li>
    <li>NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and Perseverance rover were expected to observe the comet.</li>
    <li>Comet will be visible from Earth again in early December 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first discovered in July 2025. It passed Mars in early October, where it was observed by the European Space Agency's ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter and Mars Express from a distance of approximately 30 million kilometers. The comet is set to pass the Sun at the end of October 2025, reaching its closest point in the solar system, known as perihelion.</p>

<p>Following its perihelion, 3I/ATLAS will be visible from Earth in early December and will pass Jupiter in March 2026 before reaching Saturn in July 2026, where it is expected to become too faint to see.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Aidan Berres, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign</blockquote>
<p>“Where is it coming from, where do we think it was made, or how old could it be? These are all things that are pretty important when trying to figure out not only the origins of our solar system, but the origins of this kind of rock carbon material in the universe.”</p>

<blockquote>Atsuhiro Yaginuma, Michigan State University</blockquote>
<p>“It was possible [to send a spacecraft for a fly-by], but right now, it’s probably not. There was not enough time to prepare such a mission for 3I/ATLAS.”</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object observed, following 1I/’Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. The European Space Agency is planning a Comet Interceptor mission, set to launch in 2029, to study future interstellar comets. Scientists emphasize the need for advanced preparations to send spacecraft to observe these objects as they travel through our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The European Space Agency will continue to collect data on 3I/ATLAS as it journeys through the solar system. NASA had planned to observe the comet with multiple assets, but updates remain pending due to a government shutdown. Astronomers anticipate more interstellar objects will be detected in the future, aided by advancements in observational technology.</p>
