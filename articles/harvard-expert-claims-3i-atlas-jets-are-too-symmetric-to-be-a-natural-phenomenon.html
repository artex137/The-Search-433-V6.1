      <h2>Harvard Expert Claims 3I/ATLAS Jets Are Too Symmetric to Be a Natural Phenomenon</h2>

<p>Avi Loeb, an astrophysicist at Harvard, has stated that the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS exhibits characteristics that challenge the understanding of natural phenomena. His remarks follow new analysis of images from the Hubble Space Telescope, which reveal a geometric arrangement of mini-jets emanating from the object. The analysis has generated significant interest in the scientific community since the object passed its perihelion on October 29, 2025.</p>

<p>This discovery matters because it raises questions about the nature of 3I/ATLAS and its potential origins. According to Loeb, the symmetry of the jets suggests they may not be a result of natural processes but rather could indicate technological origins. The implications for understanding interstellar objects are substantial, prompting further investigation and debate among scientists.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS has been observed moving at 58 kilometers per second.</li>
    <li>The object features three mini-jets positioned 120 degrees apart and a fourth anti-tail jet extending up to 400,000 kilometers.</li>
    <li>Loeb has classified 3I/ATLAS at Level 4 on his Loeb Scale, which assesses interstellar significance.</li>
    <li>A rare alignment with Earth will occur on January 22, 2026, allowing for enhanced observation of the jets.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is scheduled to pass Jupiter on March 16, 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS first entered the solar system in July 2025, marking only the third confirmed interstellar visitor. The object passed its closest approach to the sun on October 29, 2025. Following this event, new analyses revealed the unique structure of its jets.</p>
<p>On January 22, 2026, a significant alignment will occur, providing a unique observational opportunity for astronomers. This will be followed by the object's passage past Jupiter on March 16, 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The precision of these features has led to questions about whether this could be a technological signature,” said Dr. Frank Laukien, a colleague of Loeb. “A 120-degree angular spacing is an astounding find in a macroscopic natural object.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The analysis of 3I/ATLAS adds to a growing body of research into interstellar objects and their characteristics. The recent CIA response regarding classified records on 3I/ATLAS has further fueled public and scientific interest in the object, as authorities have neither confirmed nor denied the existence of such records.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS, especially during the upcoming alignment in January 2026, which may provide new insights into its structure and behavior. Further analysis may lead to a reevaluation of its classification on the Loeb Scale if evidence supports technological origins.</p>
