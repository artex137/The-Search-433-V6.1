      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/Atlas trends online after new clip leaves people guessing if it is rotating or not</h2>

<p>New photos and videos of the interstellar comet 3I/Atlas have surfaced on various space forums, prompting discussions about whether the comet is rotating. These clips have drawn attention since their appearance in October 2025, but no scientific evidence supports claims of unusual motion.</p>

<p>Authorities and space agencies such as NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) are monitoring the comet closely. They aim to confirm its characteristics and understand its behavior as it travels through the Solar System. Currently, no signs of rotation or strange activity have been verified.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered on July 1, 2025, in Chile.</li>
    <li>Moving at over 210,000 km/h.</li>
    <li>Passed closest to the Sun on October 30, 2025.</li>
    <li>Currently visible to telescopes, best viewed before dawn.</li>
    <li>Closest planet, Mars, is 29 million km away (October 2–3).</li>
    <li>No confirmed signs of rotation or unusual motion.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas was discovered on July 1, 2025, in Chile. It has traveled from outside the Solar System and is on a hyperbolic trajectory, meaning it will not return. After passing closest to the Sun on October 30, 2025, the comet went behind the Sun, making it invisible until recently when it became observable again.</p>
<p>Following its re-emergence, hobby sky-watchers and astrophotographers have shared videos that suggest possible rotational movement. However, these claims remain unverified by any scientific agency.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“No space agency has confirmed any rotation or unusual motion,” said a representative from NASA. “The appearances of rotation seen in videos are most likely due to camera angles and dust activity.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas is notable because interstellar objects are extremely rare. Only two others, Oumuamua and Borisov, have been documented before. Scientists are interested in studying 3I/Atlas to learn more about its composition, as it may contain frozen gases and materials from another star system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and ESA continue to analyze images of 3I/Atlas. Further updates are expected as they gather more data on the comet's characteristics and behavior.</p>
