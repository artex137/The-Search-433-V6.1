      <h2>Witness Claims UFO Sighting at Disney's EPCOT</h2>

<p>Morgan has reported seeing a UFO while at Disney's EPCOT on an unspecified date. She was sitting on a patio with her boyfriend, waiting for the fireworks show, when they noticed a bright light in the sky. The light, which was stationary, disappeared after several minutes, leaving those present puzzled.</p>

<p>This sighting has garnered attention due to the unusual nature of the event and the lack of a clear explanation. Authorities have not been involved, and no official investigation has been announced at this time.</p>

<h2>Timeline</h2>

<blockquote>“The guys were having a hard time believing me,” she added regarding the reaction of her friends.</blockquote>
