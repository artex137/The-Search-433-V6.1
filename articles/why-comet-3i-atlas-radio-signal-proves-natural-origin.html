      <h2>Comet 3I/Atlas Radio Signal Proves Natural Origin</h2>

<p>A South African observatory has detected a radio signal from comet 3I/Atlas, confirming its natural origin after weeks of speculation and conspiracy theories. The signal was captured by the MeerKAT radio telescope on October 24, 2023, just days before the comet's closest approach to the sun.</p>

<p>This finding is significant as it reinforces the scientific consensus that comet 3I/Atlas is not an alien probe, as some have speculated. The South African Radio Astronomy Observatory, which operates the MeerKAT telescope, has provided data that aligns with typical comet activity, countering claims of technological origins.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Detection date: October 24, 2023</li>
    <li>Location of detection: MeerKAT Radio Telescope, South Africa</li>
    <li>Frequencies detected: 1665 MHz and 1667 MHz</li>
    <li>Comet's closest approach to the sun: October 29, 2023</li>
    <li>Previous detection attempts: September 20 and September 28, 2023</li>
    <li>Next closest point to Earth: December 19, 2023</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On September 20 and September 28, 2023, the MeerKAT telescope attempted to detect signals from comet 3I/Atlas but was unsuccessful. The comet needed to be closer to the sun to produce detectable hydroxyl molecules through sublimation.</p>
<p>On October 24, the observatory successfully detected hydroxyl absorption patterns, which provided strong evidence against the theories suggesting that the comet might be an alien artifact. The comet reached its closest approach to the sun on October 29.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb, an astrophysicist who has suggested that 3I/Atlas might have technological origins, acknowledged the hydroxyl detection. He stated, "No other radio signals have been reported from the object," emphasizing the need for continued monitoring of the comet.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/Atlas has been the subject of intense public interest and speculation since its discovery. The heightened attention reflects a growing fascination with interstellar objects and the methods astronomers use to study them. Previous discussions about the comet have included comparisons to the Wow Signal detected in 1977, which has fueled speculation about extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The Juno spacecraft is scheduled to conduct a low-frequency radio signal search during the comet's encounter with Jupiter on March 16, 2026. This observation will provide further insights into the comet's characteristics and composition.</p>
