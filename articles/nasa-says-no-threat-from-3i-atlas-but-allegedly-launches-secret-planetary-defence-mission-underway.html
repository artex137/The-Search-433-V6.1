      <h2>NASA Says 'No Threat' from 3I/ATLAS but Allegedly Launches Secret Planetary Defence Mission Underway</h2>

<p>NASA has stated that interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth, while also reportedly launching a classified planetary defence mission due to the comet's unusual behaviour. The comet is expected to make its closest approach to Earth in December 2025, at a distance of approximately 270 million kilometres.</p>

<p>This situation has prompted discussions among scientists about the preparedness for unexpected celestial visitors. NASA's actions highlight the complexities involved in monitoring interstellar objects, which may not conform to established models of cometary behaviour.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is only the third known interstellar object to pass through our solar system.</li>
    <li>Its closest approach to Earth is projected at approximately 1.8 astronomical units (about 270 million kilometres).</li>
    <li>The comet will reach perihelion just inside Mars' orbit.</li>
    <li>NASA has initiated a classified planetary defence mission involving advanced monitoring and tracking systems.</li>
    <li>Global telescopes are preparing to observe the comet throughout the latter half of 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has displayed unusual behaviour as it travels through the solar system, prompting scientists to take notice. Its trajectory suggests a journey originating from beyond the solar system, confirming its status as an interstellar object.</p>
<p>In response to its unpredictable activity, NASA has reportedly begun preparations for a planetary defence mission. This mission includes monitoring systems and spectroscopic analyses to assess any potential risks associated with the comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We cannot assume that an object from beyond will behave like our familiar comets or asteroids,” said Professor Avi Loeb of Harvard University, highlighting the need for caution in interpreting the comet's behaviour.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Even if 3I/ATLAS proves to be nothing more than a natural comet, the lessons it teaches us about observation, preparation, and scientific communication are invaluable,” Loeb added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS challenges traditional planetary defence frameworks, which have primarily focused on known near-Earth objects. Past efforts have assumed threats would come from conventional comets or asteroids on collision courses with Earth. The unexpected nature of 3I/ATLAS underscores the need for updated strategies to handle interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As December 2025 approaches, NASA and global telescope networks will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS closely. The scientific community remains vigilant for any revelations that may arise from this mysterious interstellar visitor.</p>
