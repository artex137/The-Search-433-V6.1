      <h2>Jupiter-Bound Mission To Study Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS From Deep Space This Weekend</h2>

<p>The European Space Agency’s JUICE spacecraft will begin observing interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS this weekend, following its perihelion, or closest approach to the Sun, which occurred recently. The comet is currently on the opposite side of the Sun from Earth, making detailed observations from terrestrial observatories impossible due to solar glare.</p>

<p>The JUICE mission aims to study the icy moons of Jupiter, with a focus on Ganymede, Callisto, and Europa. These moons are believed to contain liquid oceans, prompting interest in their potential to support life. JUICE is on a trajectory to reach Jupiter in the early 2030s and is in a unique position to observe 3I/ATLAS during this period of maximum activity.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>JUICE will observe 3I/ATLAS from November 2 to November 25, 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet will be approximately 64 million kilometers (39.8 million miles) from JUICE on November 4.</li>
    <li>JUICE is equipped with five scientific instruments for the observations.</li>
    <li>Data from JUICE will be downloaded in February 2026 due to low data transmission rates.</li>
    <li>The distance of the comet from Earth will improve as Earth moves closer to it.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS recently passed its perihelion, the closest point to the Sun. This event has generated significant interest in studying the comet, particularly as JUICE is in a favorable position to conduct observations.</p>
<p>JUICE will conduct its observations of the comet from November 2 to November 25, 2023. The spacecraft will make a close pass on November 4, allowing it to collect data from a distance of 64 million kilometers.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“All this campaign was unexpected for everybody! For JUICE, indeed, we are in a cruise phase during which there are thermal constraints, being relatively close to the Sun,” said Olivier Witasse, ESA Project Scientist. “However, given the uniqueness of these observations, it was decided to prepare this extra observation planning.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“JUICE will observe 3I/ATLAS between 2 and 25 November. We will be using five instruments... We are far away (0.5 Astronomical units), therefore, only remote sensing,” Witasse explained.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Due to the position of JUICE with respect to Earth, the data rate is very low. We expect the data to be downloaded only in February 2026, so we need to be a bit patient,” Witasse added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>JUICE is part of a broader interest in studying comets and their potential to reveal information about the early solar system. Previous missions have provided valuable insights, but JUICE’s observations are expected to enhance our understanding of 3I/ATLAS during a critical period.</p>
<p>ESA missions not based on Earth have previously observed 3I/ATLAS, including orbiters around Mars, contributing to a growing body of knowledge about the comet.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following the observations, scientists will analyze the data collected by JUICE. The results are expected to be released in February 2026, offering insights into the characteristics and behavior of comet 3I/ATLAS.</p>
