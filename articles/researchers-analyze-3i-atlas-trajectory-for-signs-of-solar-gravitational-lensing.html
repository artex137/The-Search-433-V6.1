      <h2>Researchers analyze 3I/ATLAS trajectory for signs of solar gravitational lensing</h2>

<p>Researchers are analyzing the trajectory of interstellar object 3I/ATLAS to determine whether its path shows measurable effects of gravitational lensing by the Sun. The object passed closest to the Sun on October 29, 2025, eight days after solar conjunction relative to Earth and 26 days after crossing the ecliptic plane near Mars.</p>

<p>This analysis is significant as it presents a "remarkable opportunity" to observe gravitational lensing effects, according to Avi Loeb, Baird Professor of Science and director of the Institute for Science at Harvard University. Observations from multiple astronomical facilities are being examined to quantify any lensing effect on 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Closest approach to the Sun: October 29, 2025</li>
  <li>Solar conjunction relative to Earth: October 21, 2025</li>
  <li>Crossing the ecliptic plane near Mars: October 3, 2025</li>
  <li>Data reported by Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA)</li>
  <li>Observations from solar observatories: STEREO, SOHO, GOES-19</li>
  <li>Estimated debris cloud mass: exceeding five billion tons</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS crossed the ecliptic plane near Mars on October 3, 2025. Eight days later, on October 29, it made its closest approach to the Sun, coinciding with solar conjunction. Observations from ALMA indicated a non-gravitational acceleration, with the object deviating by 4 arcseconds from its predicted trajectory.</p>

<p>Following this, solar observatories documented unusual brightening and a color bluer than the Sun. These observations have been included in the analysis of potential lensing effects, with precise measurements allowing scientists to refine models of the Sun’s gravitational influence on the object's light path.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated that near perihelion, the object “brightened faster than any known comet and was bluer than the Sun.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loeb emphasized that these measurements provide a concrete test of Einstein’s theory of general relativity applied to an interstellar object passing near the Sun.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The study of 3I/ATLAS adds to the growing body of research on interstellar objects and their interactions with solar systems. Previous interstellar objects have shown various anomalies, but 3I/ATLAS presents unique characteristics, including its retrograde trajectory and unusual chemical composition.</p>

<p>These observations may enhance understanding of gravitational lensing and its effects on light paths, further validating established theories in astrophysics.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Upcoming observations in November and December 2025, as 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth, will aim to confirm or refute expectations regarding the object's behavior and characteristics. The combined datasets from ALMA, solar observatories, and ground-based telescopes are under review to determine if the predicted gravitational lensing effect can be directly detected.</p>
