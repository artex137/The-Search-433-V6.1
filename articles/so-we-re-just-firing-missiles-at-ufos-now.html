      <h2>Missile Fired at UFO off Yemen Coast</h2>

<p>The United States military has fired a missile at an unidentified flying object (UFO) off the coast of Yemen, according to Missouri Representative Eric Burlison.

<p>This event highlights ongoing concerns regarding military engagement with unidentified objects. The footage presented by Burlison during a Congressional hearing shows a spherical object being struck by a missile from another Reaper drone. The implications of this action have prompted discussions among lawmakers and military officials about the protocols for dealing with unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>
