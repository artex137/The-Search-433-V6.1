      <h2>Why Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Appears to Have “Lost” Its Tail — What Astronomers Have Discovered</h2>

<p>Astronomers have captured new images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which is currently moving away from the Sun. Observations taken on November 5, 2025, show that while the comet appears bright, its dust tail seems absent, leading researchers to investigate the phenomenon.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant because it raises questions about the comet's physical characteristics and behavior. Researchers at the Lowell Observatory in Arizona, where the images were obtained, are examining the comet's unique properties and its implications for understanding interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was observed on November 5, 2025.</li>
    <li>Images were captured by Qicheng Zhang at the Lowell Observatory in Arizona.</li>
    <li>The comet made its closest approach to the Sun on October 29, 2025.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object detected in the Solar System.</li>
    <li>The comet is visible to amateur astronomers with telescopes as small as 15 cm.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025 and made its closest approach to the Sun on October 29. After passing behind the Sun, the comet re-emerged in early November, during which time astronomers began to observe its characteristics more closely.</p>
<p>On October 31, 2025, Qicheng Zhang captured the first optical images of the comet post-perihelion. Observations indicated a rapid brightening before perihelion, with a slight blue color shift noted in previous data.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “It’s like how UV rays cause sunburns in humans. The same UV radiation is breaking down carbon-based molecules in the comet’s surface,” said Qicheng Zhang, explaining the comet's green glow.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “We’re witnessing an interstellar visitor evolving in real time as it leaves our Solar System,” added Zhang regarding the comet's visibility to amateur astronomers.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object identified in the Solar System, following ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov. The comet is believed to be billions of years older than our Sun, which provides valuable insights into the composition of distant stellar systems.</p>
<p>The comet has developed a thick, irradiated crust due to prolonged exposure to cosmic elements, which may affect the materials it releases.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it moves through the Solar System. Upcoming observations may provide further insights into its composition and behavior as it evolves over time.</p>
