      <h2>NASA is tracking a mysterious object from beyond — it raises more questions than answers</h2>

<p>Astronomers have detected an interstellar object known as 3I/ATLAS, first observed in early July 2025. The comet, currently speeding through our solar system, has prompted significant scientific interest due to its unique characteristics. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this discovery.</p>

<p>This comet is only the third confirmed interstellar object identified in the solar system. NASA has deployed advanced instruments, including the SPHEREx telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope, to gather data on 3I/ATLAS's size, physical properties, and chemical composition. Scientists aim to understand more about this enigmatic object as it continues its journey.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was first spotted in early July 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet is approximately 470 million kilometers (roughly 292 million miles) from the Sun.</li>
    <li>NASA is using the SPHEREx telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope for observations.</li>
    <li>Large amounts of carbon dioxide (CO₂) have been detected in the comet's coma.</li>
    <li>Traces of water ice have been found in the nucleus of 3I/ATLAS.</li>
    <li>The CO₂-to-H₂O ratio is one of the highest ever recorded in a comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In early July 2025, astronomers first observed the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS. Over the following weeks, NASA's SPHEREx telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope began detailed observations of the object, focusing on its size, physical properties, and chemical composition.</p>

<p>On August 6, 2025, the James Webb Space Telescope conducted observations using its Near-Infrared Spectrograph instrument, contributing to the growing body of data about 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS appears to have a very high CO₂ content, but much less water than expected,” said a representative from NASA.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The detection of 3I/ATLAS adds to a small but significant list of interstellar objects, with only two others confirmed prior to this one. The study of such comets can provide insights into the formation of the solar system and the nature of interstellar materials.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as additional data becomes available. Scientists anticipate further observations will reveal more about the comet's characteristics and its origins.</p>
