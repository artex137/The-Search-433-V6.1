      <h2>NASA Faces Backlash Over Blurry 3I/ATLAS Images as UN Launches Global Planetary-Defense Drill</h2>

<p>NASA has come under international scrutiny this week for its unclear images of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, coinciding with the United Nations activating a global planetary-defense drill to monitor the object's approach to Earth. The object, discovered on July 1 by the NASA-funded ATLAS telescope in Chile, is set to reach its closest distance to Earth on December 19, passing approximately 170 million miles away.</p>

<p>This situation is significant as it raises concerns about the effectiveness of current planetary defense measures. The UN's International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) has initiated a two-month exercise to test detection and response systems, which officials have described as a major practice scenario.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>NASA discovered 3I/ATLAS on July 1, 2023.</li>
    <li>The object will pass Earth at a distance of approximately 170 million miles on December 19, 2023.</li>
    <li>The UN's IAWN has launched a two-month planetary-defense drill.</li>
    <li>The drill aims to test detection and response systems.</li>
    <li>International scrutiny of NASA's imagery has intensified this week.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2023, NASA discovered the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS using the ATLAS telescope in Chile. As December approaches, the object is scheduled to make its closest pass to Earth on December 19, 2023. In response to the object's trajectory, the UN has activated a global planetary-defense drill through the IAWN to enhance preparedness and response capabilities.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This exercise is crucial for assessing our readiness against potential threats from near-Earth objects,” said a spokesperson from the UN's IAWN.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident follows previous concerns regarding the clarity and reliability of astronomical images used for planetary defense. The criticism directed at NASA reflects ongoing debates about the adequacy of current monitoring systems for interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities will continue the two-month planetary-defense drill, assessing the effectiveness of detection and response systems as 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth. Further evaluations of NASA's imaging capabilities may also be undertaken in light of recent criticisms.</p>
