      <h2>Interstellar comet 3IATLAS flies past Mars</h2>
<p>The European Space Agency’s (ESA) Mars orbiters, ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) and Mars Express, have observed the interstellar comet 3IATLAS during its closest approach to Mars on October 3, 2025. The comet came within 30 million kilometers of the orbiting spacecraft, marking the closest view captured by any ESA mission of this celestial object.</p>

<p>This event is significant as 3IATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar comet ever observed. Scientists are keen to study its properties and behavior as it travels through our solar system, especially since it may be the oldest comet detected, formed over 7 billion years ago in another star system. The orbiters have begun analyzing the data collected to gain insights into the comet's composition and characteristics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3IATLAS approached Mars on October 3, 2025.</li>
    <li>It came within 30 million kilometers of the spacecraft.</li>
    <li>The comet is estimated to be about 1 kilometer wide.</li>
    <li>3IATLAS is believed to be over 7 billion years old.</li>
    <li>This is the closest view of the comet captured by ESA missions.</li>
    <li>ESA's Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) will observe the comet again in November 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 3, 2025, 3IATLAS made its closest approach to Mars, observed by ESA's ExoMars TGO and Mars Express. Both orbiters utilized their cameras to capture images of the comet, despite its faintness. The TGO's Colour and Stereo Surface Imaging System (CaSSIS) successfully photographed the comet, revealing a fuzzy white dot surrounded by a glowing coma.</p>
<p>Later in November 2025, ESA's JUICE will continue monitoring 3IATLAS as it reaches perihelion, its closest point to the Sun, when the comet is expected to be most active.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This unprecedented campaign across multiple spacecraft offers a unique chance to study the chemistry and evolution of an interstellar visitor,” said an ESA representative.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3IATLAS follows the interstellar comets 1IOumuamua, observed in 2017, and 2IBorisov, observed in 2019. The study of these comets helps scientists understand planetary formation across the galaxy and the characteristics of materials from outside our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to analyze the data collected from the observations of 3IATLAS and prepare for further observations by JUICE in November 2025, as the comet approaches the Sun.</p>
