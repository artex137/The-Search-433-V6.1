      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Farewell: Watch Final Live Stream On January 22 As Interstellar Guest Exits Forever</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is preparing to leave the Solar System for good, with its final public live stream scheduled for January 22, 2026, at 23:00 UTC (11:00 PM GMT). The comet, discovered on July 1, 2025, has captivated astronomers and the public alike since its arrival from the far reaches of the Milky Way.</p>

<p>This event marks a significant moment in astronomical history as 3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object, following 1I/’Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. A group of astronomers, led by Gianluca Masi of the Virtual Telescope Project 2.0, will provide the last opportunity for viewers worldwide to observe the comet before it disappears into space.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Event Date:</strong> January 22, 2026</li>
    <li><strong>Live Stream Time:</strong> 23:00 UTC (11:00 PM GMT)</li>
    <li><strong>Observational Location:</strong> Manciano, Italy</li>
    <li><strong>Comet Distance:</strong> Approximately 2.35 AU from Earth</li>
    <li><strong>Comet Velocity:</strong> Roughly 58 kilometres per second relative to the Sun</li>
    <li><strong>Diameter Estimate:</strong> Between 320 metres and 5.6 kilometres</li>
    <li><strong>Next Major Milestone:</strong> Close approach to Jupiter in March 2026</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first observed on July 1, 2025. Since then, it has been monitored closely by various telescopes, including the James Webb Space Telescope and the Hubble Space Telescope. The comet will reach opposition on January 22, 2026, marking its peak visibility. Following this event, it will make its closest approach to Jupiter in March 2026 before continuing on its hyperbolic path out of the Solar System.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This is a unique opportunity for the public to witness a celestial object that originated from outside our Solar System,” said Gianluca Masi, founder of the Virtual Telescope Project.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The significance of 3I/ATLAS lies not only in its interstellar origin but also in its unique chemical composition, which includes unusual levels of nickel and iron. This contrasts with most comets that originate from the Oort Cloud. The data collected during its transit has provided valuable insights into the nature of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>After the final live stream, 3I/ATLAS will continue on its trajectory, making a close pass by Jupiter in March 2026. The comet is expected to leave the Solar System permanently, providing a wealth of information for researchers studying the origins of celestial bodies.</p>
