      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS to Approach Closest to Earth in December 2025</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS will make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of 269 million kilometers, according to Harvard astrophysicist Professor <strong>Avi Loeb</strong>. Loeb has expressed concerns about the absence of Hi-RISE images from NASA, which were not provided during the comet's closest pass to Mars.</p>

<h2>Why This Matters</h2>
<p>The upcoming approach of 3I/ATLAS presents a significant opportunity for observation. Loeb has stated that numerous ground-based telescopes, as well as the Hubble and Webb space telescopes, will be available for monitoring. The International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) will also track the comet from November 27, 2025, to January 27, 2026.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach:</strong> December 19, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance:</strong> 269 million kilometers from Earth</li>
    <li><strong>Monitoring Period:</strong> November 27, 2025 - January 27, 2026</li>
    <li><strong>Telescopes Involved:</strong> Hubble, Webb, and various ground-based telescopes</li>
    <li><strong>Organization:</strong> International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has been the subject of significant scientific interest due to its unusual characteristics. In November 2025, the IAWN will begin monitoring the comet, leading up to its closest approach on December 19, 2025. Following this, observations will continue until January 27, 2026.</p>

<h2>Official Statements</h2>
<blockquote>“If we do not observe a massive cloud of gas around 3I/ATLAS in December, then the reported non-gravitational acceleration near perihelion might be regarded as a technological signature of a propulsion system,” said Professor Avi Loeb.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Scientific truth is not decided by a popularity contest but by attention to data—especially when it is anomalous,” Loeb added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Professor Loeb has previously revived interest in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence through his unconventional theories. His focus on 3I/ATLAS aligns with ongoing discussions in the scientific community regarding the nature of unusual celestial objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Observations of 3I/ATLAS will be critical in determining whether the comet has a natural origin or if it displays characteristics suggesting extraterrestrial technology. The results from the IAWN monitoring campaign will further inform this investigation.</p>
