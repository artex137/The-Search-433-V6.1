      <h2>Comets should light up Glacier's skies this month; look for another cool one in December</h2>

<p>Two comets, C/2025 A6 (Lemmon) and C/2025 R2 (SWAN), are expected to be visible in the night skies of Glacier National Park and the Flathead Valley this month. Lemmon will be particularly prominent on October 20 and 21, when it will be visible to the naked eye, according to the website Stellarium. The comets are expected to be brightest as they approach Earth.</p>

<p>This visibility of comets is significant for stargazers and astronomy enthusiasts. Local authorities encourage residents and visitors to take advantage of the opportunity to observe these celestial events. Stargazing can foster interest in science and nature.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet C/2025 A6 (Lemmon) will be most visible on October 20 and 21.</li>
    <li>Comet C/2025 R2 (SWAN) will be visible from October 18 to 21.</li>
    <li>Lemmon will be brightest on October 21, appearing in the low northwest sky.</li>
    <li>SWAN will be visible in the southwest sky, near the horizon.</li>
    <li>Cloudy skies and rain are forecasted through Sunday, with a chance of clearing by October 21.</li>
    <li>Glacier's east side, particularly St. Mary, is noted for clearer skies suitable for stargazing.</li>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is expected to be visible in December 2025 after passing close to the Sun.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comets C/2025 A6 (Lemmon) and C/2025 R2 (SWAN) have been appearing in the night sky this month. Lemmon will come closest to Earth on October 21, becoming especially bright on that night. SWAN will also reach visibility during the same time frame, from October 18 to 21. Forecasts indicate rain through the weekend, but conditions may improve by October 21.</p>

<p>Looking ahead, Comet 3I/ATLAS will reach its closest point to the Sun on October 30, 2025, at a distance of about 1.4 astronomical units (approximately 210 million kilometers). It is expected to reappear for observations by early December 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Comets are objects made of dust, ice and rock left over from the formation of the solar system,” according to NASA. “As the sun’s gravity pulls them close, solar heat defrosts them and produces a cloud and tail.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The visibility of comets in the night sky can attract public interest and promote educational opportunities in astronomy. Comet 3I/ATLAS, categorized as interstellar, is the third known object from outside our solar system to pass through our celestial neighborhood, according to NASA.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Observers are encouraged to prepare for comet views as conditions allow. The status of Comet 3I/ATLAS will continue to be monitored as it approaches the Sun, with further observations expected in December 2025.</p>
