      <h2>An interstellar comet will reach its closest point to the sun this week. Don't worry, it won't even come close to Earth.</h2>

<p>An interstellar comet, known as Comet 3I/ATLAS, will reach its closest approach to the sun on October 30, 2025. The comet, which is not expected to come closer than 170 million miles to Earth, has drawn the interest of astronomers worldwide.</p>

<p>This event is significant as Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object detected in our solar system. NASA has reported that the comet provides valuable insights into the formation of other star systems and may contain chemical and physical information from billions of years ago.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
<li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
<li><strong>Discovered By:</strong> NASA's Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS)</li>
<li><strong>Closest Approach to the Sun:</strong> October 30, 2025</li>
<li><strong>Distance from Earth at Closest Approach:</strong> 170 million miles</li>
<li><strong>Estimated Size:</strong> Between 1,444 feet and 3.5 miles in diameter</li>
<li><strong>Speed:</strong> Approximately 137,000 miles per hour</li>
<li><strong>Next Appearance:</strong> Early December 2025, on the other side of the sun</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile. Further analysis revealed that the comet had been observed as early as June 14, 2025. Observations using the Hubble Telescope confirmed its size and composition. As it approaches the sun, the comet will exhibit a fuzzy appearance due to the vaporization of its ice and dust.</p>

<p>The comet will reach its closest point to the sun on October 30, 2025, and will be positioned just inside the orbit of Mars. It will not be visible to the naked eye and will require telescopes for observations when it reappears in early December 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“An interstellar object is so valuable for the scientific community because it acts like a cosmic time capsule,” said a NASA representative. “It holds other chemical and physical information about other star systems where it was formed.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“We have detected atomic nickel vapor from the comet at a vast distance from the sun, where temperatures are extremely cold,” explained an astronomer. “This raises intriguing questions about how nickel could vaporize at such low temperatures.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS follows the discovery of two previous interstellar objects: 1I/’Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. These findings have expanded our understanding of objects from beyond our solar system and their potential to provide insights into the early universe.</p>

<p>The study of interstellar comets is vital as they may contain materials from the environments of other star systems, offering clues about their formation and evolution.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As Comet 3I/ATLAS approaches the sun, astronomers will continue to observe its trajectory and composition. They will analyze data collected during its closest approach to gather insights into its origins and the nature of interstellar materials.</p>
