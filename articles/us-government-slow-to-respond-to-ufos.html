      <h2>US Government Slow to Respond to UFOs</h2>

<p>Congressional and U.S. government responses to Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs), or Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs), have been slow, with little substantive action taken since a bill was introduced in February 2025 by Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn. The bill, which aims to mandate the release of federal records related to UAPs, has not progressed in the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.</p>

<p>This lack of action is significant, as many believe that the government possesses valuable information regarding UAPs that remains undisclosed. Former Navy pilot Ryan Graves has testified about his encounters with UAPs and now leads the organization Americans for Safe Aerospace, which has reported an increase in UAP sightings from aviators and trained observers.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Bill introduced by Rep. Tim Burchett in February 2025.</li>
    <li>Bill referred to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.</li>
    <li>Americans for Safe Aerospace has received over 800 UAP reports in the last year.</li>
    <li>Reports include near-midair collisions and sustained radar tracks.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In February 2025, Rep. Tim Burchett introduced a bill aimed at requiring the release of federal records related to UAPs. The bill was subsequently referred to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. Since then, there has been no substantive progress on the bill.</p>

<p>Former Navy pilot Ryan Graves has been vocal about his experiences with UAPs and has since transitioned to leading the Americans for Safe Aerospace organization. In the past year, the organization has documented over 800 reports from various observers, indicating a growing concern over UAP encounters.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“In the last year, Americans for Safe Aerospace has received 800+ reports from aviators, radar operators, and trained civilian observers. Near-midair collisions. Sustained radar tracks. Objects exceeding known flight limits,” said Ryan Graves.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>UFOs have intrigued the American public since the 1600s, with recent government disclosures, including video footage from Navy jets, reigniting interest in the phenomena. Despite this, the government's response has not revealed much about the intelligence that may be classified.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As of now, the status of Rep. Burchett's bill remains stagnant, and it is unclear if there will be any future action taken regarding the release of UAP-related information. Investigations by various agencies may continue, but no specific timelines have been disclosed.</p>
