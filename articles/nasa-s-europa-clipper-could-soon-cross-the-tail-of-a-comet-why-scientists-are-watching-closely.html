      <h2>NASA’s Europa Clipper could soon cross the tail of a comet. Why scientists are watching closely</h2>

<p>NASA’s Europa Clipper spacecraft may soon encounter a stream of charged particles from the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS between October 30 and November 6. This event presents researchers with a rare opportunity to collect data from a comet that originated outside our solar system, according to scientists Samuel Grant from the Finnish Meteorological Institute and Geraint Jones of the European Space Agency (ESA).</p>

<p>The potential encounter is significant for scientists as it could provide valuable insights into the composition of interstellar comets. The Europa Clipper, currently orbiting about 300 million km from the sun, is equipped to study Jupiter’s magnetic field and may also detect ions from 3I/ATLAS's ion tail. This unique occurrence could enhance our understanding of the material from which these comets formed, researchers said.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event predicted between October 30 and November 6, 2023.</li>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS will reach its closest point to the sun on October 29, about 200 million km away.</li>
    <li>Europa Clipper is currently orbiting approximately 300 million km from the sun.</li>
    <li>ESA’s Hera spacecraft will also be in the same region between October 25 and November 1, 2023.</li>
    <li>Grant and Jones utilized a computer model named Tailcatcher to make predictions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Researchers have predicted that 3I/ATLAS will peak in activity around October 29, coinciding with its closest approach to the sun. As the comet approaches, its ion tail is expected to widen, increasing the likelihood of Europa Clipper encountering material from the tail.</p>
<p>Using the Tailcatcher model, Grant and Jones calculated that solar wind could transport ions from the comet's tail toward the Europa Clipper. If successful, this would allow the spacecraft to gather data on materials from another solar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “We have virtually no data on the interior of interstellar comets and the star systems that formed them,” said Samuel Grant. “Sampling the tail in this way is the closest we can currently get to a direct sample of such an object, and thus a different part of the galaxy.”
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “Cometary ions can be distinguished in a number of ways, most simply by chemical abundances,” explained Grant. “Additionally, the act of loading additional mass into the solar wind causes a general slowing and deflection of the ambient solar wind flow.”
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous studies of comets have demonstrated their role as time capsules, preserving material from their formation billions of years ago. The success of Tailcatcher in predicting encounters has been noted, as it previously identified when ESA’s Solar Orbiter detected ions from comet C/2019 Y4 (ATLAS).</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA scientists will determine whether to conduct measurements based on the predicted encounter with 3I/ATLAS. ESA's Comet Interceptor mission, scheduled for launch in 2029, aims to directly explore the coma and tail of a pristine comet from another star system.</p>
