      <p class="byline">Published 2025-12-28 22:47 UTC</p>

      <h2>Ottawa's chief science advisor spent $34K on UFO survey nobody asked for</h2>

<p>Ottawa’s Chief Science Advisor Mona Nemer has spent more than <strong>$34,000</strong> on a nationwide survey about UFOs that was not requested by any Member of Parliament. The funding was allocated through her office, even as the federal cabinet has publicly committed to reducing unnecessary expenditures.</p>

<p>Internal records obtained through Access To Information show that staff in Nemer’s office sought justification for the survey. According to Blacklock's Reporter, the memo suggested the project aimed to combat disinformation by making government-collected data more accessible. The survey results indicated that Canadians generally see little value in federal spending on UFO investigations.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Amount spent: <strong>$34,369</strong></li>
    <li>Survey conducted by: Earnscliffe Strategy Group</li>
    <li>Number of Canadians surveyed: <strong>1,008</strong></li>
    <li>Percentage of respondents who reported seeing unidentified objects: <strong>27%</strong></li>
    <li>Percentage of respondents who consider UFO research funding "very important": <strong>10%</strong></li>
    <li>Regions with highest sightings: British Columbia (32%), Ontario (29%), Saskatchewan and Manitoba (25%), Quebec (24%), Alberta and Atlantic Canada (21%)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Records indicate that the initiative originated entirely within Nemer’s office. Staff members discussed how to frame the survey as part of broader public-opinion research goals. They planned to release a report based on the findings.</p>

<p>The survey results revealed a weak public interest in funding for UFO investigations. Only <strong>10%</strong> of respondents expressed strong agreement that UFOs pose a flight-safety issue in Canada.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Just 10% strongly agreed that UFOs pose a flight-safety issue in Canada,” according to the survey results.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Support for public spending on unidentified aerial phenomenon research was weak,” a report from the pollsters stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This survey occurs amid ongoing discussions in Canada regarding government spending and transparency. The lack of parliamentary demand for the survey raises questions about the prioritization of resources within Nemer's office.</p>

<p>Prior incidents of public interest in UFOs have not typically resulted in significant governmental action or funding, suggesting a disconnect between public curiosity and governmental response.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>There are currently no plans disclosed for further investigations or initiatives related to the survey. The Chief Science Advisor's office has not announced any next steps following the release of the report.</p>
