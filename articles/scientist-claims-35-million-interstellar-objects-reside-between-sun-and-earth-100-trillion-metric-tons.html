      <h2>Scientist claims 35 million interstellar objects reside between Sun and Earth</h2>

<p>Harvard scientist Avi Loeb has estimated that there are 35 million interstellar objects within Earth's orbit around the Sun, based on recent calculations presented in a study. These objects, which he claims could collectively weigh around 100 trillion metric tons, include meteors that have been detected in the last few years.</p>

<p>This finding is significant as it suggests that interstellar objects are far more common within our solar system than previously believed. Loeb's calculations are based on the detection of two meteors, CNEOS-22 and CNEOS-25, which he believes indicate a high rate of collisions with Earth. Authorities in the scientific community are now considering further studies and expeditions to explore these claims.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Estimated number of interstellar objects: <strong>35 million</strong></li>
<li>Combined weight of these objects: <strong>100 trillion metric tons</strong></li>
<li>Years of detection: CNEOS-22 in <strong>2022</strong> and CNEOS-25 in <strong>2025</strong></li>
<li>Average collision rate of meter-scale interstellar objects: <strong>0.3 per year</strong></li>
<li>Size of detected meteors: CNEOS-22 at <strong>6 feet</strong> and CNEOS-25 at <strong>4 feet</strong> across</li>
<li>Estimated age of 3I/ATLAS: <strong>7-13 billion years</strong></li>
<li>Date of discovery for 3I/ATLAS: <strong>July 1</strong> in <strong>Chile</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS was discovered by the ATLAS telescope in Chile. This object quickly gained attention due to its estimated age of 7-13 billion years and its trajectory, which indicated it was not bound to the Sun's gravity.</p>

<p>In 2022, the first of two meteors, CNEOS-22, was detected over the Pacific. This was followed by the detection of CNEOS-25 in 2025 over the Barents Sea in the Arctic. Both meteors were found to be large enough to exceed the Solar System's escape velocity.</p>

<p>Loeb has since used these detections to estimate the existence of millions of similar interstellar objects within Earth's orbit.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Given the detection of two interstellar meteors in the CNEOS fireballs database over a period of 7 years, the inferred collision rate of meter-scale interstellar objects with Earth is about 0.3 per year,” Loeb stated. “This implies that there are about 35 million meter-scale interstellar objects embedded at any time within the orbit of the Earth around the Sun.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Each object carries about 3 million metric tons of material, which means that ‘hundred trillion (10^{14}) metric tons of interstellar material is present’ in the interior of Earth’s orbit around the Sun,” Loeb added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Before 3I/ATLAS, astronomers had identified 'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov as interstellar objects. 'Oumuamua was notable for its elongated shape and origins that puzzled scientists, while 2I/Borisov was the second known interstellar comet. The discovery of 3I/ATLAS has prompted renewed interest in the study of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Avi Loeb plans to conduct ocean expeditions to recover material from CNEOS-22 and CNEOS-25. These expeditions aim to perform radioactive dating to determine how long these meteors have traveled through interstellar space and to investigate their origins.</p>
