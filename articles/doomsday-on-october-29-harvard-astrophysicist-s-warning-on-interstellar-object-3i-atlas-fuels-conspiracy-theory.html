      <h2>Doomsday On October 29? Harvard Astrophysicist’s Warning On Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS Fuels Conspiracy Theory</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has raised alarms about the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, also known as C/2025 N1, which is expected to reach its closest point to the Sun, or perihelion, on October 29, 2025. The object has drawn attention due to its unusual characteristics and its potential implications for humanity. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This matter has gained significance as authorities and experts examine the comet's trajectory and composition. NASA's Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) first spotted 3I/ATLAS on July 1. While the object has been classified as a comet, its atypical signature has led some, including Loeb, to speculate about its true nature.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1)</li>
    <li><strong>Discovered:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Expected perihelion:</strong> October 29, 2025, at a distance of 203 million kilometers from the Sun</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> 60 kilometers per second</li>
    <li><strong>Diameter:</strong> Minimum of 5 kilometers</li>
    <li><strong>Power generation at perihelion:</strong> More than 33 gigawatts</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was detected by the NASA-funded ATLAS program on July 1, 2025. Since then, it has been observed to follow a trajectory that deviates significantly from predictions, leading to concerns about its nature. The object is expected to reach perihelion on October 29, 2025, during a time when it will be hidden from view from Earth-based telescopes.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It’s not a spaceship,” said David Jewitt, an astronomer and professor at UCLA. “But we have to consider the implications of what it could be.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“If 3I/ATLAS is a massive mothership, it will likely continue along its original gravitational path and ultimately exit the Solar system,” Professor Loeb stated.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“I don’t know if there will be meaning to money if this object turns out to be technological after October 29th,” Loeb warned in a recent video.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS follows the detection of Oumuamua, the first interstellar object identified in 2017, which also prompted speculation regarding its origins. The scientific community has been divided on the interpretation of such interstellar objects, with some suggesting they may have technological origins.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Experts will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches perihelion. The implications of its potential nature will be assessed, and further observations will be conducted to gather data on the object before and after October 29, 2025.</p>
