      <h2>NASA’s SPHEREx telescope reveals detailed composition of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS with water and organic molecules</h2>

<p>NASA has announced that its SPHEREx telescope has successfully analyzed the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, revealing the presence of water and organic molecules. The findings were released on February 7, 2026, following observations made by the telescope during its mission.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it enhances our understanding of the chemical makeup of interstellar objects and their potential to provide insights into the origins of water and organic compounds in our solar system. NASA officials are currently reviewing the data and planning further observations to deepen their understanding of the comet's characteristics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was observed by NASA's SPHEREx telescope.</li>
    <li>Findings include water and organic molecules detected in the comet's composition.</li>
    <li>The announcement was made on February 7, 2026.</li>
    <li>NASA is currently analyzing further data from the observations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>NASA's SPHEREx telescope conducted observations of comet 3I/ATLAS as part of its ongoing mission to study interstellar objects. The findings were compiled and analyzed over a period leading up to the announcement made on February 7, 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The detection of water and organic molecules in 3I/ATLAS marks a significant milestone in our exploration of interstellar comets,” said a NASA spokesperson.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This discovery builds on previous studies of interstellar objects, which have been of great interest to astronomers. Understanding the composition of such comets could provide vital clues to the origins of these materials in the solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA plans to conduct additional observations of comet 3I/ATLAS to gather more data and further analyze its composition and behavior.</p>
