      <h2>Interstellar traveler makes once-in-a-lifetime visit</h2>

<p>A comet known as 3I/Atlas is making its closest approach to Earth this week, passing within 167 million miles of the planet on Friday. The discovery of this interstellar object marks a rare opportunity for astronomers and stargazers to observe a visitor from another star system before it vanishes into the depths of space.</p>

<p>The significance of 3I/Atlas lies in its status as only the third confirmed interstellar object to enter our solar system. Authorities, including NASA, have deployed multiple space telescopes to study the comet, which offers key insights into the formation of planetary systems beyond our own. The comet was first discovered over the summer and is currently fading as it moves away from the sun and Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas will pass 167 million miles from Earth on Friday.</li>
    <li>Discovered in summer 2025, it is the third known interstellar object to visit our solar system.</li>
    <li>The comet measures between 1,444 feet and 3.5 miles in size, though its exact dimensions are not disclosed.</li>
    <li>NASA's Hubble Space Telescope has captured images of the comet from 178 million miles away.</li>
    <li>3I/Atlas will swing within 33 million miles of Jupiter in March 2026.</li>
    <li>The comet will not return to our solar system once it reaches interstellar space, expected in the mid-2030s.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas was discovered in summer 2025. Since then, astronomers have tracked its trajectory as it approaches Earth. The comet's closest pass will occur on Friday, with its brightness diminishing as it moves farther from the sun and Earth.</p>

<p>In late November, the Hubble Space Telescope captured images of the comet when it was approximately 178 million miles from Earth. This event marks a unique opportunity for observations before the comet exits our solar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“While Friday marks the comet’s closest approach to Earth, its journey through our solar system continues for several more months,” said Paul Chodas, director of NASA’s Center for Near Earth Object Studies.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of interstellar objects has gained attention in recent years, with the first known visitor, Oumuamua, detected in 2017. The second, comet 2I/Borisov, provided the first confirmed observation of an interstellar comet. The increasing detection of such objects suggests they may be more common than previously thought.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/Atlas continues its journey, professional observatories will monitor its progress to gather data on its composition and trajectory. Amateur astronomers are encouraged to observe the comet before it fades from view.</p>
