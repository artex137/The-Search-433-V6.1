      <h2>Trump reportedly preparing UFO speech, source claims</h2>
<p>President Donald Trump is allegedly preparing a speech on unidentified flying objects (UFOs) that could confirm extraterrestrial contact, according to British writer and ufologist Mark Christopher Lee. Lee reported that an anonymous insider from Washington has provided information about the speech, which is expected to be made public on May 1, 2026.</p>

<p>This potential announcement comes amid growing public interest in UFOs and alien life. If the claims are accurate, it could lead to an official disclosure of recovered non-human materials and crafts, which have been kept secret by previous administrations due to national security concerns and fear of public reaction.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Reported speech date: May 1, 2026</li>
    <li>Source: Mark Christopher Lee, a British writer and ufologist</li>
    <li>Key incidents mentioned: 1947 Roswell event, 2004 "Tic Tac encounter," 2015 USS Roosevelt incidents</li>
    <li>Public belief: Nearly two-thirds of Americans believe intelligent life exists on other planets, according to a 2021 survey</li>
    <li>Potential speech details include declassification of related files and formation of a new interagency task force</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Mark Christopher Lee claims he was contacted by a Trump administration insider regarding the potential speech. Initially, he suggested the speech would occur at a United Nations address. However, the timeline has shifted with the insider planning to go public on May 1, 2026. Lee believes the speech will coincide with the anniversary of the Roswell incident, originally suggested for July 8, 2026.</p>
<p>In past remarks, President Trump has expressed skepticism about UFOs but has also indicated an openness to the possibility of alien life. His daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, has acknowledged the buzz around the speech, noting that the president has been reluctant to share details.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This is not a threat, it is an opportunity to unite humanity in understanding our place in the universe,” the insider claims President Trump will state in the speech.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Lee stated in an email that he feels responsible for sharing this information in good faith, adding that “the public deserves transparency on a topic that has been concealed for decades.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>A popular podcast responded to Lee’s claims bluntly, saying, “None of this is going to happen.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discussion of UFOs has gained traction in recent years, particularly following the release of military videos showing unexplained aerial phenomena. The U.S. government has faced pressure to disclose information regarding UFOs, with public interest surging as surveys indicate a significant portion of the population believes in extraterrestrial life.</p>
<p>Previous administrations have maintained secrecy on this topic, often citing national security as the primary concern. This potential speech marks a significant shift in discourse surrounding UFOs and governmental transparency.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The insider's decision to publicly disclose information on May 1, 2026, could accelerate discussions regarding UFOs and extraterrestrial life. The White House has not confirmed any planned speech, and it remains unclear how the administration will proceed following the potential announcement.</p>
