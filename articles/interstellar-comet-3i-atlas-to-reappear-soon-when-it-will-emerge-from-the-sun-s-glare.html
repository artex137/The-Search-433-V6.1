      <p class="byline">Published 2025-11-04 04:32 UTC</p>

      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS to Reappear Soon: When It Will Emerge from the Sun’s Glare</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is set to become visible in the pre-dawn eastern sky in early November 2025 after passing closest to the sun on October 29, 2025. This comet, which originates from outside our solar system, was discovered in July 2025 and will not return to its point of origin.</p>

<p>This event is significant as 3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object ever discovered. Scientists believe studying this comet can provide insights into material from other planetary systems, enhancing our understanding of the universe. Observers are preparing to view this rare phenomenon, which will require specific equipment and conditions for optimal visibility.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the sun occurred on October 29, 2025.</li>
    <li>Visibility is expected from early November 2025 to mid-December 2025.</li>
    <li>A minimum 10-inch telescope is required for viewing.</li>
    <li>Best viewing locations include Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Florida, and Southern California.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>July 2025: Comet 3I/ATLAS is discovered while still far from the sun.</p>
<p>October 29, 2025: The comet reaches its closest point to the sun.</p>
<p>Early November 2025: The comet is expected to become visible in the eastern sky before sunrise.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“By studying this comet, astronomers can learn from material from other planetary systems and tell us more about the universe around us,” said an unnamed astronomer involved in the study.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is unique as it is only the third interstellar object discovered, following previous findings that have garnered significant interest from the scientific community. Observations of such comets provide valuable data on the formation and evolution of planetary systems beyond our own.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Observers are advised to verify updates from official astronomy sources or observatories as visibility conditions may vary. The opportunity to witness 3I/ATLAS is expected to be a notable event for amateur astronomers equipped with the necessary tools.</p>
