      <h2>Steven Spielberg confirms new sci-fi epic Disclosure Day set for 2026 release</h2>

<p>Steven Spielberg has announced his return to science fiction with the upcoming film <strong>Disclosure Day</strong>, scheduled for release on June 12, 2026. This marks Spielberg’s first feature since his 2022 drama <strong>The Fabelmans</strong>, and it signals a revival of the genre that has defined much of his career.</p>

<p>The film, produced by <strong>Universal Pictures</strong>, features an ensemble cast, including Josh O’Connor, Emily Blunt, Colman Domingo, Wyatt Russell, and Eve Hewson. It explores humanity’s reaction to the discovery of extraterrestrial life. The film’s logline poses a provocative question: “If you found out we weren’t alone, if someone showed you, proved it to you, would that frighten you?”</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Release Date:</strong> June 12, 2026</li>
    <li><strong>Production Company:</strong> Universal Pictures</li>
    <li><strong>Director:</strong> Steven Spielberg</li>
    <li><strong>Cast:</strong> Josh O’Connor, Emily Blunt, Colman Domingo, Wyatt Russell, Eve Hewson</li>

</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Steven Spielberg has a long history with the science fiction genre, having first explored UFO themes in <strong>Close Encounters of the Third Kind</strong> in 1977. Following this, he further delved into the subject with films such as <strong>E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial</strong> and <strong>War of the Worlds</strong>.</p>
<p>In 2025, mysterious billboards appeared in Los Angeles and New York, hinting at the film's themes with the message, “all will be disclosed.” Filming occurred in and around New Jersey, although specific plot details remain undisclosed.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “People have a right to know the truth,” one character asserts in the film's teaser.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    Spielberg has previously stated that it is “mathematically impossible” that humans are the only intelligent beings in the cosmos.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Spielberg's work has often reflected societal interests in UFOs and extraterrestrial life. His films have contributed significantly to public discourse surrounding these themes, influencing both popular culture and perceptions of the unknown.</p>
<p>As public interest in UFOs has risen, especially in light of recent government disclosures, <strong>Disclosure Day</strong> is positioned to tap into this growing curiosity.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the film approaches its release date, further promotional content, including trailers and interviews, is expected to provide more insights into its storyline and themes. Fans and critics alike await more details as the film’s premiere date draws nearer.</p>
