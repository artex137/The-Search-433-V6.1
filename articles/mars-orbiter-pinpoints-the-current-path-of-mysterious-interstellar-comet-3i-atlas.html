      <p class="byline">Published 2025-11-18 23:02 UTC</p>

      <h2>Mars orbiter pinpoints the current path of mysterious interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>On October 3, 2025, astronomers successfully tracked interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it passed within approximately 29 million kilometres of Mars. The comet, first spotted on July 1, 2025, is the third known interstellar object observed in our Solar System. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities.</p>

<p>The tracking of 3I/ATLAS is significant because it provides crucial data about the comet's composition and trajectory. The European Space Agency (ESA) has utilized the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter to enhance the accuracy of the comet's predicted path, reducing uncertainty and enabling more precise observations. This collaboration marks a key advancement in planetary defense and comet study.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first observed on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>The closest approach to Mars occurred on October 3, 2025, at a distance of about 29 million km.</li>
    <li>The comet travels at speeds of up to 250,000 km/h.</li>
    <li>The ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter provided data that improved tracking accuracy by ten-fold.</li>
    <li>The data from the Mars orbiter is the first of its kind to be accepted into the Minor Planet Center database.</li>
    <li>ESA’s Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer is also observing 3I/ATLAS, with expected data release in February 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers discovered comet 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar object entering our Solar System. Following its discovery, tracking efforts commenced using Earth-based telescopes. Between October 1 and October 7, 2025, the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter joined the tracking efforts, providing enhanced data as the comet passed near Mars. The closest approach to Mars occurred on October 3, 2025.</p>

<p>Data from the Mars orbiter enabled a significant improvement in the accuracy of the comet's trajectory, marking a milestone in interstellar object tracking.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “This exercise with 3I/ATLAS demonstrates the value of triangulating data from Earth with observations from a second location in space,” said a representative from ESA’s Near-Earth Object Coordination Centre.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The tracking of 3I/ATLAS is part of ongoing efforts by ESA to monitor near-Earth objects and enhance planetary defense capabilities. This comet's passage offers insights into the broader galaxy, highlighting that our Solar System is not isolated. Previous interstellar objects have also provided valuable data about the universe beyond our immediate vicinity.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>ESA is preparing the Neomir mission to improve detection of near-Earth objects coming from the direction of the Sun. The Comet Interceptor mission is also in development, aimed at studying comets, potentially including interstellar ones. These initiatives will enhance readiness for future encounters with celestial objects.</p>
