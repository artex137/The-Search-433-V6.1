      <h2>Astronomers Capture Post-Perihelion Images of Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Astronomers have captured recent images of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, revealing a complex multi-jet structure. The images were taken on October 31, 2025, by Qicheng Zhang at Lowell Observatory in Arizona. The comet was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the NASA-funded ATLAS survey telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile.</p>

<p>The observations of 3I/ATLAS are significant as it is the third confirmed interstellar object detected in our Solar System. The comet reached its closest approach to the Sun on October 30, 2025, and will remain observable through December as it moves back into interstellar space.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>It reached perihelion on October 30, 2025, coming within 1.4 AU (210 million km) of the Sun.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is traveling at a maximum speed of about 68 km/s.</li>
    <li>It will make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of 269 million km.</li>
    <li>Observations of the comet's jet structure have been made by astronomers from the ICQ Comet Observations group and the British Astronomical Association.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, in Rio Hurtado, Chile. It reached perihelion on October 30, 2025, coming close to the Sun. Following perihelion, it became visible to Earth-based telescopes again. The first post-perihelion image was captured on October 31, 2025, by Qicheng Zhang. Subsequent images were taken by astronomers from the ICQ Comet Observations group on November 8 and the British Astronomical Association on November 9, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Given that a large number of jets appear in many directions, the reported non-gravitational acceleration of 3I/ATLAS requires much more than 10-20% of its initial mass to have been ejected near perihelion,” said Professor Avi Loeb of Harvard University.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“This multi-jet structure constitutes a remarkable target for future observations with the Hubble and Webb telescopes, as 3I/ATLAS will arrive at closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025,” Professor Loeb added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object confirmed in our Solar System, following 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Its hyperbolic orbit and high eccentricity distinguish it as one of the most dynamically extreme objects recorded to date.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to observe 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth. The comet will be a focus for future studies using advanced telescopes, such as Hubble and Webb, particularly to analyze its unique multi-jet structure.</p>
