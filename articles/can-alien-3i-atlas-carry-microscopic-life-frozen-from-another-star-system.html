      <h2>Can comet 3I/ATLAS carry microscopic life frozen from another star system?</h2>

<p>Scientists are investigating whether comet 3I/ATLAS, which is currently traveling through space, could carry traces of life from another star. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities associated with the comet.</p>

<p>This research is significant because it may provide insights into how life can spread between worlds. Authorities in the scientific community are closely examining the comet's composition and structure, which could inform future space missions aimed at probing comets for signs of life.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is believed to contain water ice and complex organic molecules.</li>
    <li>Microbes may survive in the comet's icy layers during its long journey through space.</li>
    <li>Scientists are analyzing spectral data, dust, and gas compositions related to the comet.</li>
    <li>No direct proof of life has been found on 3I/ATLAS to date.</li>
    <li>The study of 3I/ATLAS is part of the expanding field of astrobiology.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has been under observation by scientists as it travels through the solar system. Researchers have focused on its icy nucleus, which may protect potential microbes from space radiation. The journey of the comet spans millions or even billions of years, raising questions about the survival of any potential life forms contained within.</p>

<p>As part of ongoing research, scientists have been examining the comet's spectral data and outgassing patterns to better understand its composition. However, no signs of life have been detected thus far.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Finding life on 3I/ATLAS would revolutionise our understanding of biology and the universe,” scientists have stated, emphasizing the importance of this research.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous studies have suggested that comets and asteroids could carry microbial life across the cosmos, supporting the theory of panspermia. This theory posits that life can spread between star systems via such celestial bodies. The ongoing exploration of comets like 3I/ATLAS is helping to expand the field of astrobiology.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Future missions by space agencies are planned to send probes to the tails and nuclei of comets, including 3I/ATLAS. This research aims to enhance our understanding of comet composition and the potential for life beyond Earth.</p>
