      <h2>Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS Is Speeding Through Our Solar System</h2>

<p>Interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has been journeying through the solar system since early October 2023, passing Mars at a distance of approximately 18.6 million miles. The comet, which originated from beyond our solar system, is expected to continue its trajectory toward the Sun, passing by Venus and Jupiter before leaving our solar system. There have been no reports of injuries or fatalities related to the comet's passage.</p>

<p>The significance of 3I/ATLAS lies in its unique characteristics and the discoveries it has prompted. Researchers from Auburn University have detected hydroxyl (OH) gas emanating from the comet, which suggests the presence of water. This finding provides insights into the evolution of comets and the potential for life-sustaining ingredients being common throughout the universe. NASA and other space agencies are closely monitoring the comet's path and its interactions with the solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS passed Mars on October 1, 2023.</li>
    <li>It was approximately 18.6 million miles from Mars during its closest approach.</li>
    <li>The comet is losing water at a rate of 40 kg per second.</li>
    <li>Hydroxyl gas detected indicates the presence of water.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third identified interstellar object in our solar system.</li>
    <li>Visibility from Earth is expected in December 2023.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In early October 2023, 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to Mars, marking a significant moment for astronomers. Researchers at Auburn University detected hydroxyl gas from the comet, indicating the presence of water. This discovery has sparked further interest in the characteristics of interstellar comets and their implications for understanding planetary systems.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“When we detect water—or even its faint ultraviolet echo, OH—from an interstellar comet, we’re reading a note from another planetary system,” said Professor Dennis Bodewits from Auburn University.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Every interstellar comet so far has been a surprise,” stated Dr. Zexi Xing. “Oumuamua was dry, Borisov was rich in carbon monoxide, and now ATLAS is giving up water at a distance where we didn’t expect it.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS adds to the growing body of knowledge about interstellar objects. Previous interstellar comets, such as Oumuamua and Borisov, have provided valuable insights into the diversity of materials found in different planetary systems. The detection of water from 3I/ATLAS challenges previous assumptions about the characteristics of comets from outside our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey, scientists will monitor its trajectory and observe its visibility from Earth in December 2023. Researchers expect to learn more about the comet's structure and the implications for the study of comets and planetary formation.</p>
