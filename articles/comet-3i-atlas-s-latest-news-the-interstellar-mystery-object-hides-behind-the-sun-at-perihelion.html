      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS's latest news: The interstellar "mystery object" hides behind the Sun at perihelion</h2>

<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS is currently obscured from view behind the Sun during its perihelion, which is its closest approach to the Sun. The object is not visible to the naked eye, but high-resolution astronomical systems continue to monitor it from Earth.</p>

<p>This monitoring is significant as scientists seek to understand the nature of 3I/ATLAS. Authorities, including NASA and NOAA, are using advanced equipment to track its brightness and activity. Experts suggest that unless the comet significantly dims, it will remain under observation throughout its perihelion.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is approximately 445 million kilometres from Earth as of 21 July 2025.</li>
    <li>The Hubble Telescope has captured images of the comet's teardrop-shaped dust shell.</li>
    <li>NOAA's GOES-19 satellite is tracking the comet with its CCOR-1 coronagraph.</li>
    <li>NASA's PUNCH space probes are also monitoring 3I/ATLAS.</li>
    <li>The comet is expected to emerge from behind the Sun in December 2025.</li>
    <li>Tracking challenges arise due to the faint light emitted by the comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 21 July 2025, the Hubble Telescope captured an image of 3I/ATLAS when it was 445 million kilometres from Earth. Since then, various astronomical instruments have been monitoring its brightness and trajectory. The comet is currently behind the Sun, making direct observation difficult.</p>
<p>In December 2025, 3I/ATLAS is anticipated to re-emerge from the Sun's glare, allowing ground-based telescopes to resume their monitoring efforts.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Unless 3I/ATLAS fades substantially in the next few days, we should be able to track it closely throughout its perihelion,” said coronagraph expert Karl Battams.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “Objects at the threshold of detection, like 3I/ATLAS, pose a challenge for coronagraphs. We often have to employ image stacking techniques,” Battams explained.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has generated significant interest among astronomers due to its interstellar origin. The ongoing monitoring by various space agencies reflects a broader trend in astronomical research, where scientists utilize advanced technologies to study distant celestial objects.</p>
<p>The comet's behavior is currently consistent with typical cometary activity, which includes shedding gas and dust as it approaches the Sun.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey, experts will analyze data from the monitoring instruments. They expect to gather more information about the comet's characteristics when it emerges from the Sun’s glare in December 2025.</p>
