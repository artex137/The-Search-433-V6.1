      <h2>Astronomers say 3I/ATLAS could be a 10-billion-year-old relic from the galaxy’s earliest planetary systems</h2>

<p>A team of astronomers has announced that interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS might be a relic from the galaxy's early planetary systems. The comet was first spotted on 1st July 2025 as it raced through the Solar System, moving at nearly twice the speed of previous interstellar visitors. The discovery was made in A Coruña, Spain, and has sparked significant scientific interest.</p>

<p>This finding is important because it provides insights into the formation of planetary systems in the galaxy. Researchers at the University of A Coruña have utilized advanced simulations and data from the European Space Agency’s Gaia mission to trace the comet's path over the past 10 million years. The research, submitted to the Astrophysical Journal, suggests that 3I/ATLAS could be as old as 10 billion years, potentially offering a glimpse into the early universe.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first observed on 1st July 2025.</li>
    <li>It travels at a speed nearly double that of previous interstellar comets.</li>
    <li>The nucleus of 3I/ATLAS is estimated to be about 5.6 kilometres in diameter.</li>
    <li>Its mass could exceed 33 billion tonnes.</li>
    <li>The comet has been tracked using data from the ESA’s Gaia mission.</li>
    <li>Researchers identified 93 close stellar encounters in the last 10 million years.</li>
    <li>The strongest stellar perturber passed at about 0.30 parsec (approximately 0.97 light-years).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected on 1st July 2025. Following its discovery, astronomers commenced tracking its trajectory and began simulating its past movements through the Milky Way. They utilized data from the Gaia mission to analyze the comet's interactions with nearby stars over the past 10 million years. The research findings were compiled and submitted to the Astrophysical Journal.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It looks like a comet and behaves like a comet,” said NASA's small-bodies lead scientist, emphasizing the natural characteristics of 3I/ATLAS.</blockquote>
<blockquote>A separate analysis from a SETI-affiliated scientist noted that the comet's hyperbolic trajectory and spectral properties align with those of natural comets, rebuffing claims of technological origins.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The detection of 3I/ATLAS adds to the growing body of knowledge regarding interstellar objects. Previous encounters, such as with ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have raised questions about the origins and nature of these cosmic visitors. The study of such comets helps scientists understand the formation and evolution of planetary systems in the universe.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it travels through the Solar System, gathering more data to refine their understanding of its origins and characteristics. Further observations may provide additional insights into the early conditions of the galaxy.</p>
