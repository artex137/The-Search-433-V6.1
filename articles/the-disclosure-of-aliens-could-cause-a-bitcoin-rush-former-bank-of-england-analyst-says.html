      <h2>The Disclosure of Aliens Could Cause a Bitcoin Rush, Former Bank of England Analyst Says</h2>

<p>A former analyst at the Bank of England has urged the bank to prepare for the potential disclosure of alien life by the Trump administration in the United States. Helen McCaw, who previously worked in financial security at the bank, has written to Governor Andrew Bailey about the need for economic preparations in light of this possibility. McCaw's concerns arise from a growing number of credible reports from high-level government officials regarding unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs).</p>

<p>This matter has gained attention as predictions surrounding the disclosure of alien life have increased. According to the prediction market Polymarket, there is currently a 12% chance that such a revelation will occur before 2027. McCaw's letter highlights the potential for financial instability and volatility in markets if this disclosure takes place, prompting her to advocate for proactive measures.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Helen McCaw has previously worked in financial security at the Bank of England.</li>
    <li>She has written to Governor Andrew Bailey regarding potential alien disclosure.</li>
    <li>Polymarket currently predicts a 12% chance of alien disclosure before 2027.</li>
    <li>High-level officials, including Marco Rubio and James Clapper, have spoken on UAPs.</li>
    <li>The documentary "Age of Disclosure" features discussions on the topic.</li>
    <li>McCaw suggests a rush to bitcoin could occur if trust in government assets diminishes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In recent years, there has been an increase in the number of credible reports regarding UAPs from government officials. Notable figures such as Secretary of State Marco Rubio and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper have contributed to discussions on the topic.</p>

<p>In 2023, NASA launched a research mission to a metal-rich asteroid, which could have implications for mining precious metals in space.</p>

<p>McCaw's letter to the Bank of England's governor marks a proactive step in addressing the economic implications of potential alien disclosure.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“There might be extreme price volatility in financial markets due to catastrophising or euphoria, and a collapse in confidence if market participants feel uncertain on how to price assets using any of the familiar methods,” McCaw reportedly wrote in her letter.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“If there is an official announcement and we get presented with very clear evidence that nobody is going to dispute, I would say that in a matter of hours, you are going to have total financial instability,” she added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The conversation surrounding UAPs has intensified in recent years, with several government officials publicly acknowledging the phenomenon. The documentary "Age of Disclosure" has further brought attention to the topic, suggesting that a significant announcement could be imminent.</p>

<p>McCaw's concerns about the impact on financial markets echo broader discussions regarding trust in government-backed assets, particularly in the context of emerging technologies and their potential economic implications.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The Bank of England has not yet disclosed any specific plans in response to McCaw's letter. Investigations into UAPs and their implications for national security and the economy are expected to continue, along with ongoing discussions about the future of digital currencies and traditional assets.</p>
