      <h2>Why Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Is Emitting Perfectly Symmetrical Triple Jets</h2>

<p>As of January 2026, interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is exhibiting unusual behavior as it approaches the outer reaches of our Solar System. The comet is producing three distinct, symmetrical jets of material, a phenomenon that astronomers have rarely observed and cannot yet explain. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities associated with this cosmic event.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it challenges existing models of cometary behavior. Researchers from NASA and the Breakthrough Listen project are investigating the comet's unusual characteristics and are urging caution in interpreting the data. The ongoing study of 3I/ATLAS may provide insights into the composition and behavior of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was identified as an interstellar object in July 2025.</li>
    <li>It is currently moving at a speed of 58 km/s.</li>
    <li>The comet will pass near Jupiter's moon Eupheme in March 2026.</li>
    <li>Observations have been made using the Gemini North telescope in Hawaii and NASA's Hubble Space Telescope.</li>
    <li>Recent radio scans from the Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia found no evidence of artificial signals.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, astronomers first identified 3I/ATLAS as an interstellar object. By late November to December 2025, high-resolution observations revealed the comet's unique feature of producing three symmetrical jets. The jets are separated by 120 degrees and show consistent brightness and curvature.</p>
<p>As 2026 progresses, researchers continue to study the comet's unusual behavior while preparing for its upcoming pass near Eupheme.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This geometry remains locked in place, resisting the usual fluctuations driven by rotation or uneven solar heating,” said a NASA spokesperson.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“For now, the consensus is that 3I/ATLAS is a natural object, albeit one that is forcing us to broaden our definitions of 'normal',” a researcher from the Breakthrough Listen project noted.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interstellar comets are rare, with 3I/ATLAS being one of the few identified to date. The comet's composition may differ significantly from local comets, as it formed around another star billions of years ago. Previous studies have shown that most comets exhibit chaotic behavior in their jet emissions, making 3I/ATLAS's symmetry particularly noteworthy.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Jupiter's moon Eupheme in March 2026. Observations will focus on its unique jet activity and the implications for our understanding of interstellar objects.</p>
