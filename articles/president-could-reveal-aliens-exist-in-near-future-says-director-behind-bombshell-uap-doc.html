      <h2>President could reveal aliens exist in 'near future,' says director behind bombshell UAP doc</h2>

<p>Dan Farah, director of the documentary <strong>The Age of Disclosure</strong>, has stated that a sitting president might soon announce the existence of non-human intelligent life. Farah made his comments in an interview with Entertainment Weekly ahead of the film's release on November 21, 2023.</p>

<p>This potential announcement is significant as it could mark a turning point in public understanding of unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP). Authorities, including U.S. intelligence agencies, have previously been required to provide reports on UAP, and Farah believes the film may prompt further transparency from the government.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Film release date: November 21, 2023.</li>
    <li>Director: Dan Farah.</li>
    <li>Film features testimony from 34 U.S. government and military officials.</li>
    <li>Notable interview subjects include former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and current Secretary of State Marco Rubio.</li>
    <li>Previous UAP report: 144 incidents since 2004, with all but one remaining unexplained.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In March 2023, <strong>The Age of Disclosure</strong> premiered at the South by Southwest (SXSW) festival. The film compiles testimonies from various officials on the alleged cover-up regarding non-human intelligent life.</p>
<p>In 2020, President Trump signed a COVID-19 relief bill that included a requirement for U.S. intelligence agencies to report on UAPs. This led to the release of an unclassified report in 2021.</p>
<p>Farah has indicated that since completing the documentary, he has received information suggesting that Trump is actively seeking to understand the facts surrounding UAP.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "I think it's only a matter of time before the release of this film is followed by a sitting president stepping to the podium and telling the world, 'We're not alone in the universe,'" said Dan Farah.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "I really hope that the release of this documentary leads to the U.S. government finally revealing everything it legally can to the American public regarding UAP and nonhuman intelligent life," Farah added.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The topic of UAPs has gained traction in recent years, particularly following the 2021 report by U.S. intelligence agencies. There has been a growing public demand for transparency regarding government knowledge of such phenomena, with many expressing concern over misinformation.</p>
<p>Farah's film builds on a narrative of secrecy and potential cover-ups that have persisted for decades, aiming to shed light on what many believe to be an ongoing disinformation campaign.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the documentary approaches its release, attention will focus on how the U.S. government responds to its content and whether it will lead to further disclosures regarding UAP and non-human intelligent life.</p>
