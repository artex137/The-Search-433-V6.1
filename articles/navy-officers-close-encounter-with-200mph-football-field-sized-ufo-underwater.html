      <h2>Navy officers' close encounter with 200mph 'football field' sized UFO underwater</h2>

<p>A top-ranked navy officer has reported that his men had a close encounter with a 'football field' sized unidentified flying object (UFO) travelling underwater at speeds of 200 mph. The incident, described by Congressman Tim Burchett, took place in deep water areas beneath Earth's oceans. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This encounter is significant as it adds to ongoing investigations into unidentified submerged objects (USOs) and aerial phenomena by military personnel. Authorities are examining these sightings to understand their implications for national security and military technology.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Reported by Congressman Tim Burchett, part of a US Congress probe into UFOs.</li>
    <li>The UFO was described as being the size of a football field.</li>
    <li>The object was said to be travelling underwater at 200 mph.</li>
    <li>Burchett stated that no human-made vehicle could achieve these speeds underwater.</li>
    <li>Previous encounters include a report from Bob McGwire, who described a similar experience while on the USS Hampton.</li>
    <li>The Pentagon is investigating at least 800 alleged close encounters.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In a recent statement, Congressman Tim Burchett disclosed that a high-ranking navy officer reported an encounter with a large unidentified object moving at high speeds underwater. This report follows a history of similar claims, including one by Bob McGwire, who described a close encounter while aboard the USS Hampton, a fast attack submarine, approximately 30 years ago.</p>
<p>McGwire reported that during a classified mission, his submarine detected an object moving faster than the speed of sound underwater. He stated that the incident was not reported at the time due to concerns it would hinder their mission.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“A very high-ranking member of the Navy described some underwater experiences with something that was doing 200 mph underwater. It was as big as a football field. That’s no fish,” said Congressman Tim Burchett.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Not with our technology, no. The best we have is probably in the high 30s,” Burchett added when asked if the object could have been manmade.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Why would we risk multi-million-dollar apparatus? Why would we put something in the air around our best pilots that could have a crash? Because what these guys are talking about - they’ve come close to collisions,” Burchett emphasized.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident is part of a broader trend of increasing reports of unidentified aerial phenomena and submerged objects. The Pentagon's recent probe into at least 800 alleged encounters reflects a growing interest in understanding these sightings, which have raised questions about national security and advanced technology.</p>
<p>Bob McGwire's encounter, which he kept secret for decades, highlights the challenges faced by military personnel in reporting unusual sightings without jeopardizing their missions.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into these sightings will continue as the Pentagon seeks to understand the nature of these encounters. Further details on the outcomes of the ongoing probes have not been disclosed.</p>
