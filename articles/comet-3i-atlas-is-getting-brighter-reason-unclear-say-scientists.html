      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS is Getting Brighter: Reason ‘Unclear’, Say Scientists</h2>

<p>A rapid surge in the brightness of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has been observed as it nears its closest approach to the sun on Wednesday, October 29, 2025. No injuries or fatalities have been reported related to the comet's activity.</p>

<p>This phenomenon is significant as it may provide insights into the comet's characteristics and origins. Scientists are monitoring the comet closely, with some suggesting it could exhibit signs of being an extraterrestrial spacecraft. The findings have been documented in a preprint study that has not yet undergone peer review.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was originally discovered in July 2025.</li>
<li>The comet is expected to reach perihelion on October 29, 2025.</li>
<li>NASA's Hubble Space Telescope captured images of the comet at a distance of 277 million miles from Earth.</li>
<li>The comet has shown a rapid rise in brightness according to multiple instruments, including STEREO-A and SOHO.</li>
<li>NASA reports that comet 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025. Observations have indicated a rapid increase in brightness as it approaches perihelion on October 29, 2025. Researchers have noted that the comet appears bluer than the Sun, which is unexpected for such celestial objects.</p>

<p>The brightness measurements have been taken using several instruments, including STEREO-A’s SECCHI HI1 and COR2, and SOHO’s LASCO C3, among others. These observations have been documented in a preprint study published in October 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The reason for 3I’s rapid brightening remains unclear,” the authors of the study noted.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The appearance of 3I/ATLAS as bluer than the Sun is very surprising,” said Harvard professor Avi Loeb. “We must therefore add the blue color at perihelion as a ninth anomaly to the list of unexpected properties of this strange interstellar object.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has displayed several unusual characteristics since its discovery, including a trajectory aligned closely with the ecliptic plane of the planets. Loeb has ranked the comet on his "Loeb scale," suggesting a possible technological origin due to its unexpected properties.</p>

<p>Previous observations have noted that the comet's nucleus is significantly larger than other notable comets, and its arrival trajectory has been finely tuned to avoid visibility from Earth during perihelion.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor comet 3I/ATLAS as it moves through its perihelion phase. Further analysis and peer review of the findings are expected in the coming months.</p>
