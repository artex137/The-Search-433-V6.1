<p>A Reddit user, known as 'Rhea', has claimed that Earth has been under surveillance by advanced extraterrestrial beings for billions of years, according to a post that has gained significant attention online.

The post has sparked widespread debate and curiosity about the existence of extraterrestrial life and government knowledge of such phenomena.</p>

<p>The claims have prompted discussions among UFO enthusiasts, skeptics, and the general public. Authorities have not disclosed any official response to these allegations, but the post has raised questions about what governments may know regarding extraterrestrial surveillance and potential threats.</p>
