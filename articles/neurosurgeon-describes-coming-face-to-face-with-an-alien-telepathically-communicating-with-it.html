      <h2>Neurosurgeon Describes Coming Face-To-Face With An Alien, Telepathically Communicating With It</h2>

<p>A neurosurgeon has reported an encounter with an alien being while it was held in captivity in Brazil, according to filmmaker James Fox. The incident occurred nearly two decades ago in Varginha, Brazil, a site known for its infamous UFO sightings. No injuries or fatalities were reported during the encounter.</p>

<p>This claim is significant as it adds to the ongoing discussions surrounding UFOs and potential extraterrestrial life. Authorities have not disclosed any investigations related to this specific encounter, but the incident has garnered renewed interest, particularly with the release of Fox's documentary titled <em>Moment of Contact</em>.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Incident occurred in Varginha, Brazil, nearly two decades ago.</li>
<li>A neurosurgeon reported telepathic communication with an alien being.</li>
<li>The alien was approximately 5 feet tall, with a teardrop-shaped cranium and large red eyes.</li>
<li>Three women initially reported the encounter with the alien.</li>
<li>Another alien-like creature was reportedly found and taken by military vehicles for examination.</li>
<li>Filmmaker James Fox has interviewed eyewitnesses and officials for his documentary.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In the late 1990s, three women in Varginha reported seeing an alien about 5 feet tall. Following this, another creature was found on a roadside and was picked up by military vehicles. Witnesses claimed to have seen a UFO hovering over cattle in the area for approximately 40 minutes. Recently, James Fox interviewed a neurosurgeon who claimed to have encountered the alien while it was in captivity and communicated with it telepathically.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I went to school in São Paulo for neurology and neurosurgery. I have done more than five thousand surgeries. I want to share this message that I really saw it!”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“I went in to see a patient, and it was not a patient. It was really an alien. Clearly an alien.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“I wondered if he was suffering. He was not. If he was cognizant, he was very calm, very tranquil. Like it understood what I was thinking, entirely.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“It was a higher level of intelligence. So much higher, more advanced. Even though that it was in captivity, it had control of the room.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Varginha Incident is often referred to as “Brazil’s Roswell,” drawing parallels to the 1947 UFO incident in the United States. The ongoing interest in UFO sightings and extraterrestrial encounters has led to increased public discourse and investigations by various entities, including governmental agencies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities have not disclosed any ongoing investigations related to the claims made by the neurosurgeon or the events in Varginha. Further discussions about the implications of these encounters may arise as more information becomes available.</p>
