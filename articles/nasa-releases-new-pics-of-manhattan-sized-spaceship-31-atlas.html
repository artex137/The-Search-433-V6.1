      <h2>NASA releases new pics of Manhattan sized ‘spaceship’ 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>NASA has released new images of the celestial object 3I/ATLAS, which some scientists, including theoretical physicist Avi Loeb, argue may not be a typical comet but rather an alien spacecraft. The debate surrounding the object has intensified, with Loeb suggesting it could be an "alien mothership" as it travels through the Solar System at speeds of 209,000 km/h. NASA has maintained that the object behaves like a comet, emphasizing its natural characteristics during a press conference on October 30, 2023.</p>

<p>The discussions around 3I/ATLAS matter because they challenge our understanding of interstellar objects and raise questions about potential extraterrestrial life. NASA's Associate Administrator Amit Kshatriya clarified the agency's position, while Loeb has criticized NASA for not exploring the object's unusual features more deeply. This ongoing debate highlights the divide between traditional scientific perspectives and more speculative theories regarding the cosmos.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> 209,000 km/h</li>
    <li><strong>Date of NASA Press Conference:</strong> October 30, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Location of Press Conference:</strong> NASA Headquarters</li>
    <li><strong>Key Figures:</strong> Amit Kshatriya (NASA), Avi Loeb (Theoretical Physicist)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In recent months, scientists have closely monitored 3I/ATLAS as it travels through the Solar System. The object was first identified as a comet, but debates about its true nature have emerged, particularly from Avi Loeb, who posits it could be an alien spacecraft. On October 30, 2023, NASA held a press conference to address these claims and clarify their position on the object.</p>

<p>During the conference, Kshatriya emphasized that NASA views 3I/ATLAS as a comet, pointing out its behavior of shedding gas and dust. In response, Loeb criticized NASA for their conservative approach and called for a more open-minded investigation into the object's characteristics.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "NASA's representatives should have emphasized what we do not understand about 3I/ATLAS rather than insist that it is a familiar comet from a new birth environment," stated Avi Loeb in his latest blog post.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    "We should not 'judge a book by its cover,' because we all know about the Trojan Horse which appeared unthreatening to the guardians of the City of Troy," Loeb added, urging for a deeper investigation into the object.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The debate surrounding 3I/ATLAS reflects a broader trend in the scientific community regarding the classification and understanding of interstellar objects. Previous incidents involving unidentified celestial phenomena have sparked similar discussions, often pitting traditional scientific approaches against more speculative theories. This ongoing scrutiny of 3I/ATLAS may influence future investigations into other interstellar visitors.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA plans to continue monitoring 3I/ATLAS and investigate its composition further. Avi Loeb has called for additional scrutiny to determine whether any other objects have accompanied the comet during its journey through the Solar System.</p>
