      <h2>Congressman Calmly Explains There Are "Entities" Coming From “Five or Six Deepwater Areas”</h2>

<p>U.S. Representative Tim Burchett has claimed that alien entities are present on Earth, emerging from deep ocean areas, during a video posted on social media on October 30, 2024. The Tennessee congressman made these remarks while walking in Washington, D.C., drawing attention to unidentified phenomena linked to naval sightings.</p>

<p>The significance of Burchett's statements comes amid ongoing congressional discussions about unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs) and military encounters with unexplained objects. His comments follow a recent hearing where military officials faced questions regarding UAPs and a video showing an unidentified object interacting with a drone.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Representative Tim Burchett made the claims during a video posted on social media.</li>
    <li>The video was recorded on October 30, 2024, in Washington, D.C.</li>
    <li>Burchett mentioned a higher frequency of sightings in “five or six” deepwater areas.</li>
    <li>He referenced previous discussions with naval personnel about sightings of underwater craft.</li>
    <li>In January, Burchett claimed to have been informed about a large alien craft traveling at high speeds.</li>
    <li>The recent congressional hearing involved U.S. military and defense officials discussing UAPs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 30, 2024, Tim Burchett made claims about alien entities in a video while walking in Washington, D.C. He noted the potential existence of these entities in deepwater locations.</p>
<p>Earlier in January 2024, Burchett had previously disclosed information from an unidentified admiral about an alien craft reportedly as large as a football field.</p>
<p>A week prior to Burchett's remarks, a congressional hearing discussed a video showing a missile bouncing off a UAP, presented by Missouri Congressman Eric Burlison.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“What if, these are entities that are here on this earth, that have been on this earth for who knows how long, and we think they're coming from way out,” Burchett said in the video.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“We have a higher propensity of sightings around these five or six — I believe — deep water areas. It creates a question there,” he added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Burchett's comments reflect a growing interest among U.S. lawmakers in UAPs, a topic that has seen renewed focus in recent years. Historical claims of UFO sightings date back to the Cold War era, where various officials have expressed beliefs in extraterrestrial encounters.</p>
<p>The recent congressional hearing highlighted a video presented by Burlison, which has raised questions about the transparency of military encounters with UAPs and the data available to lawmakers and the public.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Congress is expected to continue investigating UAPs and their implications for national security, with further hearings planned to address military transparency and public access to UAP data.</p>
