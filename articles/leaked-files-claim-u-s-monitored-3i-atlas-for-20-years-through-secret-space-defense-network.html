      <h2>Leaked Files Claim U.S. Monitored 3I/ATLAS for 20 Years Through Secret Space-Defense Network</h2>

<p>Leaked documents have revealed that the U.S. has allegedly monitored the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS for over 20 years through a secret space-defense network. The materials, circulated online in early November, detail a surveillance system integrating several programs, including CASSANDRA, ORACLE VI, ARGUS-VIS, and UMBRA-3/C.</p>

<p>This revelation has raised significant questions about the extent of U.S. monitoring of 3I/ATLAS, which is expected to pass through the inner Solar System in 2025. Authorities have not yet commented on the leaks, but the documents suggest that the surveillance framework may have been operational long before the public timeline indicates.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Leaked documents circulated online in early November 2023.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is expected to pass through the inner Solar System in 2025.</li>
    <li>CASSANDRA was first publicly introduced in 2005 at the 57th International Astronautical Congress.</li>
    <li>ORACLE was launched by the Air Force Research Laboratory in 2022 with a $72 million contract.</li>
    <li>UMBRA's radar constellation has been operational since 2021.</li>
    <li>Two images dated 2 November 2025 show unusual emissions from 3I/ATLAS.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2005, CASSANDRA was introduced as a theoretical framework for detecting and monitoring distant objects. In 2022, the Air Force Research Laboratory launched the ORACLE program, which is expected to enhance tracking capabilities. By 2024, the ORACLE-M mobility demonstrator was deployed, followed by the anticipated launch of the ORACLE-P surveillance satellite in 2026. The recent leaked documents suggest that monitoring of 3I/ATLAS has been ongoing since the early 2000s.</p>

<p>On 2 November 2025, two images captured near perihelion showed emissions from 3I/ATLAS that analysts described as inconsistent with typical comet behaviour.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The structured emissions contrast with typical cometary outgassing and raise questions about whether the images reflect advanced observation filters rather than anomalous comet physics,” analysts noted.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The leaks have intensified scrutiny of U.S. planetary-defense systems, which have long been the subject of speculation. The documents suggest a high level of cooperation between U.S. military and civilian space programs in monitoring interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As investigations continue, the U.S. government has not yet addressed the leaks. NASA is preparing to release its own high-resolution images of 3I/ATLAS, which may provide further insights into the ongoing monitoring of the object.</p>
