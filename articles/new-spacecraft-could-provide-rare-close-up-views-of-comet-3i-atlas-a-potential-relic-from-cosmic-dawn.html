      <h2>New spacecraft could provide rare close-up views of Comet 3I/ATLAS, a potential relic from cosmic dawn</h2>

<p>New research has explored the potential for various spacecraft to visit Comet 3I/ATLAS, which was discovered on July 1 by the ATLAS (Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System). This comet is only the third known celestial object believed to have originated from outside our solar system.</p>

<p>This research matters because Comet 3I/ATLAS offers scientists a rare opportunity to gain insights into an ancient cosmic object. Its trajectory and speed of approximately 130,000 mph (219,000 km/h) suggest it may be around 7 billion years old, providing material from a time known as "cosmic noon," when star formation was prolific. Researchers are investigating which spacecraft could effectively monitor the comet during its critical perihelion phase, when it will be positioned behind the Sun and invisible to Earth-based telescopes.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2023.</li>
    <li>It is approximately 7 billion years old, older than our Sun.</li>
    <li>It moves at a speed of 130,000 mph (219,000 km/h).</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth is expected on December 19, 2025, at 168 million miles (269 million km).</li>
    <li>NASA's Psyche will be about 28 million miles (45 million km) from 3I/ATLAS during perihelion.</li>
    <li>European Space Agency's JUICE will be around 43 million miles (68 million km) away at the same time.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2023, during routine observations by the ATLAS system. As it approaches the Sun, the comet sheds material, creating its characteristic tail. The most significant material loss occurs at perihelion, when the comet is closest to the Sun. This event is expected to take place on December 19, 2025.</p>
<p>Research has since focused on identifying spacecraft that can observe 3I/ATLAS during this critical period. Missions like NASA's Psyche and ESA's JUICE are well-positioned to provide valuable data, with JUICE set to perform a gravity assist flyby of Venus in August 2024.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We would need to look through or past the Sun to observe 3I/ATLAS,” said Andreas M. Hein from the University of Luxembourg. “The bright glare of the Sun would obscure the faint comet.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS's discovery adds to the understanding of interstellar objects. Prior to 3I/ATLAS, only two other known objects have been identified as originating from outside our solar system. The study of such comets can provide insights into the early formation of galaxies and the materials present before the Solar System existed.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The upcoming months will be crucial for studying Comet 3I/ATLAS. As it approaches perihelion, spacecraft will gather data that could yield insights into its composition and behavior. The potential for meteor showers resulting from fragments of the comet may also offer additional opportunities for observation from Mars and Earth.</p>
