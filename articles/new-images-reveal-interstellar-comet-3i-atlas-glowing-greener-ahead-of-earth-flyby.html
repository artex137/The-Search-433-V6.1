      <h2>New Images Reveal Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Glowing Greener Ahead of Earth Flyby</h2>

<p>New observations from the Gemini North telescope in Hawaii have shown that the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is brightening and developing a greenish hue as it approaches its closest encounter with Earth on December 19. The enhanced activity is linked to increased sublimation of ice on the comet's surface due to its recent close passage to the sun in late October.</p>

<p>This development is significant as it provides insights into the comet's characteristics and behavior. Researchers from the National Science Foundation's NOIRLab have captured images of 3I/ATLAS, revealing a transition from a reddish appearance observed in late August to a notable green hue. This transformation offers valuable information about the comet's composition and the processes at play as it nears the sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is expected to make its closest approach to Earth on December 19.</li>
    <li>It will come within 170 million miles (270 million kilometers) of Earth.</li>
    <li>The comet was detected in late June traveling at approximately 130,000 mph (210,000 km/h).</li>
    <li>Images were taken on November 26 using four different filters: blue, red, orange, and green.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object identified, following 'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov.</li>
    <li>Significant features include large jet formations and signs of wear from its journey.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In late June, astronomers detected 3I/ATLAS as it traveled through the solar system. The comet exhibited a reddish appearance until late August. Following a close passage to the sun in late October, new observations captured on November 26 revealed an increase in brightness and a shift to a green hue.</p>

<p>The comet is now on a hyperbolic trajectory, indicating it will not return to our solar system after its December flyby. Experts are monitoring its behavior closely as it approaches Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The transition from red to green indicates the release of new molecules as the comet heats up,” said a representative from the National Science Foundation’s NOIRLab.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The green glow is primarily due to diatomic carbon (C2), which emits distinctive light as it escapes into space,” the representative added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is significant for its status as one of the largest and oldest interstellar objects observed to date. Its study enhances the understanding of interstellar bodies and the formation of early star systems in the Milky Way. Previous interstellar objects like 'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov have also captivated scientists, contributing to ongoing research in this field.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth, gathering data on its size, trajectory, and composition. Observatories and space agencies worldwide are collaborating to deepen the understanding of this interstellar visitor.</p>
