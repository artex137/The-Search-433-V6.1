      <h2>Comet 3I/Atlas Approaches Earth, Sparking Interest Among Astronomers</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/Atlas, identified in July by the University of Hawaii's Institute for Astronomy, is set to come closest to the Sun on October 30, 2025, at a distance of approximately 210 million km. It is the third interstellar comet to enter our solar system in the last eight years, following Oumuamua in 2017 and Borisov in 2019. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities associated with the comet's approach.</p>

<p>The significance of Comet 3I/Atlas lies in its unique characteristics and trajectory. Astronomers are closely monitoring the comet as it approaches the Sun, providing an opportunity to study its unusual composition and behavior. The comet's visibility to Earth-based telescopes throughout October adds to its intrigue among both scientists and the public.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas identified in July 2023.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun expected on October 30, 2025.</li>
    <li>Distance at closest approach: approximately 210 million km.</li>
    <li>Comet size estimated at up to 20 km.</li>
    <li>Speed: over 245,000 km/h, making it the fastest object detected in the solar system.</li>
    <li>Comet's coma dominated by carbon dioxide (90%) and water vapour (5%).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2023, researchers at the University of Hawaii's Institute for Astronomy first identified Comet 3I/Atlas. Its trajectory was tracked as it approached the Sun, marking it as a noteworthy event in the astronomical community.</p>
<p>By October 30, 2025, the comet is expected to make its closest approach to the Sun. After this date, it will become less visible from Earth until early December when it will again be observed at about 270 million km from our planet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The trajectory of 3I/Atlas has been tracked leading up to its closest approach, which presents a rare opportunity for observation,” said a representative from the University of Hawaii's Institute for Astronomy.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/Atlas is part of a notable influx of celestial bodies entering the solar system, with five bright comets approaching Earth in 2025 alone. Previous interstellar comets, Oumuamua and Borisov, were only detected after they had passed through the solar system, making 3I/Atlas's approach particularly significant for ongoing astronomical studies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to observe Comet 3I/Atlas as it approaches the Sun. The data collected during its trajectory will provide insights into the comet's composition and the dynamics of interstellar objects.</p>
