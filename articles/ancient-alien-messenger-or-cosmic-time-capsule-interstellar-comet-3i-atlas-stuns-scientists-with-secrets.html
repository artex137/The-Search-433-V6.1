      <h2>Ancient Alien Messenger or Cosmic Time Capsule? Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Stuns Scientists with Secrets</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, the third-known interstellar object, has passed through our solar system after being detected on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile. The comet is travelling at approximately 137,000 miles per hour (220,000 km/h) and follows a trajectory unbound to the Sun's gravity, indicating it originated from outside our solar system.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant for astronomers as it provides a rare opportunity to study material from a star system that formed over 7 billion years ago, predating Earth and our Sun. Authorities and scientists worldwide are actively observing the comet, conducting extensive research to understand its unusual chemical composition and origins.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Detected on July 1, 2025, by ATLAS in Chile.</li>
    <li>Traveling at approximately 137,000 mph (220,000 km/h).</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun occurred on October 29-30, 2025, at about 1.4 AU (130 million miles).</li>
    <li>Potentially over 7 billion years old.</li>
    <li>Comet's coma is rich in carbon dioxide and water vapor, with a high CO₂-to-water ratio.</li>
    <li>Global observation campaign includes numerous telescopes and spacecraft, such as ESA’s Mars Express and NASA’s Perseverance rover.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers detected Comet 3I/ATLAS, classifying it as an interstellar object due to its hyperbolic trajectory and extreme speed. Following its discovery, a global effort commenced to track and analyze the comet, with observatories around the world calculating its orbit.</p>

<p>By late summer 2025, 3I/ATLAS began releasing gas and dust at a remarkable rate, indicating its high activity level. The comet reached its closest point to the Sun in October 2025, after which it began to move back toward interstellar space.</p>

<p>As it approached Mars in early October 2025, several spacecraft captured images and data, contributing to an extensive international research campaign to study the comet’s properties and origins.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It is not a harbinger of doom, but a messenger carrying information from a planetary system beyond our own,” said an ESA spokesperson regarding the comet's nature.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Each one of these has been special and precious, and everybody drops everything to look at them,” noted astronomer Karen Meech of the University of Hawaii.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is significant as the third interstellar object ever recorded, following 1I/‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Previous encounters with interstellar objects have sparked significant interest and research in the field of astronomy, as they provide insights into the formation of the galaxy and the chemical processes at play in different star systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey through the solar system, scientists will analyze data collected from various telescopes and spacecraft. Future observations will focus on understanding the comet's chemical makeup and its implications for the study of interstellar objects.</p>
