      <h2>3I/ATLAS: NASA Scientists Reveal Truth Behind the 'Colour-Changing' Space Visitor</h2>

<p>NASA scientists have clarified the characteristics of comet 3I/ATLAS, which was discovered in July 2023 and made its closest approach to the Sun on 30 October. Reports of the comet changing colours from red to green have been deemed exaggerated, according to a postdoctoral fellow at Lowell Observatory.</p>

<p>This analysis is significant as it addresses widespread misconceptions about the comet and its behaviour. As 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth, scientists are keen to understand more about its composition and trajectory, which may challenge existing comet models.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2023.</li>
<li>It made its closest approach to the Sun on 30 October 2023.</li>
<li>The comet is one of only three verified interstellar objects detected, following 'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov.</li>
<li>Its nearest point to Earth will occur in late December 2023, at approximately 170 million miles away.</li>
<li>The comet has brightened fivefold since perihelion.</li>
<li>It has shown an unusual anti-tail pointing toward the Sun.</li>
<li>Some scientists have speculated about its size, comparing it to Manhattan.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first observed in July 2023. As it approached the Sun, three solar observatories captured images of the comet on 30 October, which sparked reports of a colour change. By early November, images from the R. Naves Observatory in Spain indicated the absence of a visible tail, raising further questions among scientists.</p>
<p>In September 2023, amateur astronomers noted a green halo surrounding the comet, which has persisted. The comet is expected to exit the Solar System in January 2024.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We don't have any evidence for the gas coma changing colours. Our result just showed that the gas coma is likely still around and contributing substantially to the overall brightness.”</blockquote> 
<p>— Qicheng Zhang, postdoctoral fellow at Lowell Observatory</p>

<blockquote>“When you have a visitor to your backyard, you better know its nature.”</blockquote>
<p>— Avi Loeb, Harvard scientist</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object identified, following significant discoveries in 2017 and 2019. The comet's behaviour, including its lack of a visible tail and unusual brightness, has led to discussions regarding its classification and origin, with some scientists questioning traditional comet models.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey, NASA may release high-resolution images captured by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter's HiRise camera, which could provide further insights into the comet's nature once federal operations resume.</p>
