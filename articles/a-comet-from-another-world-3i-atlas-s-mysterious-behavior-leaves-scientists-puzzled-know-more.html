      <h2>A comet from another world? 3I/ATLAS’s mysterious behavior leaves scientists puzzled</h2>

<p>A comet named 3I/ATLAS has been confirmed as the third interstellar object to visit our Solar System, following 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. The comet is currently on a hyperbolic trajectory, meaning it is not bound to the Sun and will return to interstellar space. There are no reported injuries or fatalities associated with its passage.</p>

<p>The unusual behavior of 3I/ATLAS has drawn significant attention from astronomers and scientists. Its unique characteristics provide a rare opportunity to study the building blocks of other star systems. Agencies such as NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) have begun planning observations to track the comet's approach.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is on a hyperbolic trajectory.</li>
    <li>It is the third confirmed interstellar object in our Solar System.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS has an unusual tail and jets pointing toward the Sun.</li>
    <li>Its coma has a high carbon dioxide ratio compared to water.</li>
    <li>Perihelion, or closest approach to the Sun, is expected in late October 2025.</li>
    <li>NASA and ESA are planning observation strategies.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified as an interstellar object when it entered the Solar System. Its trajectory indicates that it originated from interstellar space. The comet displays unique characteristics that differ from typical Solar System comets, prompting further investigation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS provides a chance to probe the geology of another star system,” said a representative from NASA. “The knowledge it brings could have a very long half-life for our understanding of the galaxy.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I/ATLAS, 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov were the only confirmed interstellar objects observed. The behavior of these objects has led to ongoing discussions in the scientific community about the formation and dynamics of comets in different star systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches perihelion in late October 2025. Observations will help refine models of comet formation and outgassing behavior based on the comet's unique characteristics.</p>
