      <h2>UFO festival on Thailand tourism calendar in 2026</h2>

<p>The Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) has announced a UFO festival scheduled for February 2026 at Khun Dan Prakarnchon Dam in Nakhon Nayok province, aiming to attract both domestic and international visitors. This event is part of a broader strategy to increase international arrivals by at least 10% after disappointing 2025 numbers.</p>

<p>TAT governor Thapanee Kiatphaibool emphasized the need to rebuild trust with tourists through safety measures and memorable experiences. The agency has also initiated the “Hat Yai Rise Up” project to revitalize areas affected by severe flooding last month, with caravan tours from Singapore and Malaysia planned to visit Hat Yai for the first time since the incident.</p>

The agency aims to increase foreign arrivals from 33 million in 2025 to 36.7 million in 2026, representing an 11% increase. The festival site, Khao Kala, has previously hosted a UFO-themed music festival, making it a popular destination for enthusiasts.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>TAT will continue to implement strategies to attract tourists, including expanding measures for halal tourism and revitalizing nightlife. The agency is focused on achieving its target of 36.7 million arrivals and increasing total revenue for 2026.</p>
