      <h2>Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS Changed Color Again, And Shows Signs Of Non-Gravitational Acceleration</h2>

<p>A team of astronomers has reported that interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has changed color for the second time and is showing signs of non-gravitational acceleration as it approaches perihelion. The findings were shared in a study that has not yet been peer-reviewed and were observed using various solar observatories on October 29.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it could provide insights into the object's composition and behavior. Astronomers from the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) and NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory are closely monitoring 3I/ATLAS, which is believed to be a comet. Understanding its characteristics may reveal information about its origins and the environment in which it formed.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was first spotted on July 1, 2023.</li>
    <li>The object has brightened to around magnitude 9, making it visible with small telescopes.</li>
    <li>It is located about 203 million kilometers from the Sun at perihelion.</li>
    <li>The comet shows non-gravitational acceleration of 135 kilometers per day squared.</li>
    <li>Significant outgassing is expected in November and December 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2023, astronomers at ATLAS discovered 3I/ATLAS as it traveled through the Solar System. The object was confirmed as an interstellar comet due to its velocity and eccentricity. Observations on October 29 indicated a change in color and brightness, with further analysis revealing signs of non-gravitational acceleration.</p>

<p>As the comet approached perihelion, it was obscured from Earth's view by the Sun, prompting speculation about its behavior. However, most astronomers, including those at NASA and SETI, have dismissed claims of extraterrestrial involvement.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The non-gravitational acceleration was measured at the perihelion distance of 1.36 times the Earth-Sun separation,” said Avi Loeb, a Harvard astronomer. “This implies that over the month it takes 3I/ATLAS to cross a spatial scale of order its perihelion separation from the Sun, 3I/ATLAS would lose about a tenth of its mass.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object observed, following 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. The study of such objects helps astronomers understand the formation of the universe and the materials that existed billions of years ago. Previous observations of interstellar objects have often raised questions about their origins and characteristics, but few have shown the same level of activity as 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to observe 3I/ATLAS as it approaches perihelion and after it passes. The European Space Agency’s Juice spacecraft may detect the expected mass loss in early November, while further observations will aim to clarify the reasons behind the comet's rapid brightening and its future behavior.</p>
