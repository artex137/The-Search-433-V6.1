      <h2>Pilot spots UFO hovering near private jet while flying 3,500 feet over Rhode Island</h2>

<p>A pilot of a private jet has reported seeing a “strange, small object” floating near his aircraft at approximately 3,500 feet over Rhode Island on December 23, 2025. The incident occurred while the pilot was in communication with air traffic control at T.F. Green International Airport.</p>

<p>This sighting has raised interest among aviation authorities, as reports of unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) have become more frequent. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) stated that such reports are formally documented when raised by pilots, and they investigate if supporting information is available.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of sighting: December 23, 2025</li>
    <li>Location: T.F. Green International Airport, Rhode Island</li>
    <li>Altitude: Approximately 1,067 metres (3,500 feet)</li>
    <li>Aircraft type: Piper PA-32RT-300T Turbo Lance II</li>
    <li>Object description: Small silver canister</li>
    <li>Control tower response: No other reports of objects in the area</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On December 23, 2025, a pilot flying at 3,500 feet contacted air traffic control after spotting a small silver object near the right wing of his aircraft. During the exchange, the pilot described the object as "standing still" and asked if there were any known objects in the vicinity. Air traffic controllers had no reports and suggested it might be a drone or balloon, which the pilot refuted.</p>

<p>The pilot observed the object for a brief period, stating it appeared to hover alongside his plane before disappearing from sight. The conversation with air traffic control included reactions of surprise and humor from ground controllers and other pilots monitoring the frequency.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Looks like a strange, small object that we just floated by. A small silver canister. Do you know what that could be?” 
    — Pilot of the private jet
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “Creepy,” 
    — Air traffic controller responding to the sighting
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “The FAA documents UAP sightings whenever a pilot reports one to an air traffic control facility.” 
    — FAA statement to Fox News Digital
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The incident is part of a growing trend in reported UAP sightings, particularly by pilots. The FAA has established protocols for documenting these sightings, which are often investigated if corroborating radar data exists. The increasing number of reports has led to greater scrutiny of airspace safety and unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The FAA will continue to document and investigate the sighting, assessing any available radar data to support the pilot's claims. Further details regarding the investigation have not been disclosed.</p>
