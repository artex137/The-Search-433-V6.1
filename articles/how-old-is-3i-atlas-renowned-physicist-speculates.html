      <h2>How old is 3I/ATLAS? Renowned physicist speculates</h2>

<p>Renowned physicist Michio Kaku has speculated on the age of comet 3I/ATLAS during a recent discussion, emphasizing its significance in understanding the solar system's formation. The remarks were made in a segment aired on October 15, 2023, where Kaku addressed the comet's origins and its implications for future astronomical studies.</p>

<p>This speculation matters because it could provide insights into the early solar system and its evolution. Kaku's analysis has sparked interest among astronomers and researchers, prompting further investigation into the comet's characteristics and trajectory.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS has been observed since 2019.</li>
    <li>Michio Kaku shared his insights on October 15, 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet is expected to pass close to Earth in 2024.</li>
    <li>Kaku is a professor of theoretical physics at City College of New York.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first identified in 2019. Since then, it has been a subject of interest for astronomers worldwide. On October 15, 2023, Michio Kaku discussed its potential age and significance in a public forum.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Understanding the age of comets like 3I/ATLAS can provide crucial information about the conditions of the early solar system,” Kaku said during the segment.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is part of a larger group of celestial bodies that scientists study to learn more about the origins of the solar system. Previous studies of other comets have revealed important information about the early solar system’s conditions and composition.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth in 2024, gathering data to further investigate its characteristics and origins.</p>
