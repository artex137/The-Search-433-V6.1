      <h2>3I/ATLAS 'Intergalactic Cyanide Tablet'? Harvard Expert Avi Loeb Calms Fears Over 'Poison' Comet</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has addressed concerns about comet 3I/ATLAS, which passed closest to Earth on December 19, 2025. While the comet has been linked to toxic gases, Loeb has reassured the public that the risks are minimal, as the comet was approximately 170 million miles away at its closest point.</p>

<p>The comet, discovered by the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile on July 1, 2025, has garnered attention due to its unusual chemical composition and behaviors. Scientists are particularly intrigued by the presence of cyanide and hydrogen cyanide in the comet's gas plume, which raises questions about potential impacts on Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS closest approach: December 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth at closest point: approximately 170 million miles</li>
    <li>Comet diameter: estimated up to 46 kilometres (28 miles)</li>
    <li>Mass loss rate: shedding carbon dioxide at 129 kilograms per second</li>
    <li>Expected arrival near Jupiter: March 16, 2026</li>
    <li>Distance from Jupiter at closest approach: approximately 33 million miles</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected by the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile on July 1, 2025. Observations in the autumn revealed significant amounts of methanol and hydrogen cyanide. The comet made its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025. Loeb's analysis indicates that it will pass near Jupiter on March 16, 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, “Given the mass loss rate of 3I/ATLAS, there are less than a million of these large objects released in recent months.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loeb also noted, “The solar wind acts as a celestial broom,” suggesting that any gases released would not reach Earth.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object discovered, following 'Oumuamua and Borisov. Its unusual characteristics have sparked debates about the nature of interstellar objects and the possibility of artificial origins.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue monitoring 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Jupiter. The data collected during its journey is expected to inform future studies on interstellar objects and their potential impacts on Earth.</p>
