      <h2>Interstellar visitor gets my eyes on the sky</h2>

<p>NASA has captured an image of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it passed Mars at a speed of 219,000 km/h, approximately 38 million kilometres from Earth. The image was taken by the Perseverance rover over the weekend, although the agency has not confirmed that the object is indeed 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<p>This comet is significant as it is the third interstellar object detected by humanity. Discovered in July, 3I/ATLAS is notable for its unusual chemical profile, which includes high levels of carbon dioxide and water ice. NASA has stated that the comet poses no threat to Earth, with its closest approach being 270 million kilometres away.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Speed: 219,000 km/h</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth during image capture: 38 million kilometres</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: 270 million kilometres</li>
    <li>First detected: July 2023</li>
    <li>Detected by: Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope in Chile</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2023, 3I/ATLAS was first detected by the ATLAS telescope in Chile. Over the weekend, NASA's Perseverance rover snapped an image of the comet as it passed Mars. The image was released shortly after the observation.</p>

<p>Scientists have observed that 3I/ATLAS has an unusual chemical composition, leading to heightened interest among astrophysicists. Speculation regarding its nature has circulated, but most scientists have dismissed these theories as unfounded.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “If we keep dismissing the possibility of non-natural origin simply because it’s ‘too wild,’ we risk missing out on the truth.” 
    — Avi Loeb
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object detected, following previous discoveries that have sparked interest in the study of celestial objects beyond our solar system. The chemical makeup of such objects provides insights into the formation and evolution of planetary systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA continues to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it travels through the solar system. Researchers aim to analyze its chemical profile further to enhance understanding of interstellar objects and their origins.</p>
