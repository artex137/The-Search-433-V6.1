      <h2>Interstellar Objects Like Comet 3I/ATLAS Could Act As Planetary Seeds</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has sparked significant interest since its appearance in the inner Solar System in July 2025. Researchers have focused on the potential role of interstellar objects (ISOs) in planetary formation. The findings were presented at the Joint Meeting of the Europlanet Science Congress and the American Astronomical Society’s Division for Planetary Science (EPSC-DPS2025).</p>

<p>This research could provide insights into how planets form around young stars. Authorities and scientists are now exploring the implications of ISOs like 3I/ATLAS in both the core accretion and gravitational instability models of planet formation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS appeared in July 2025.</li>
    <li>Research presented at EPSC-DPS2025 in Germany.</li>
    <li>Professor Susanne Pfalzner of Forschungszentrum Jülich led the study.</li>
    <li>Three ISOs have been detected so far, including Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019.</li>
    <li>ISOs could act as seeds for the formation of planets around higher-mass stars.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, Comet 3I/ATLAS entered the inner Solar System, drawing attention from scientists interested in ISOs. At the EPSC-DPS2025 meeting, Professor Pfalzner presented her research on how ISOs might influence planet formation. The study highlighted the potential for ISOs to overcome barriers in the current models of planetary development.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Interstellar objects may be able to jump start planet formation, in particular around higher-mass stars,” said Professor Susanne Pfalzner during her presentation.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior research has established two main theories of planet formation: core accretion and gravitational instability. The core accretion model suggests that small dust particles aggregate to form larger bodies, while the gravitational instability model posits that dense regions in a protoplanetary disk collapse to form planetary cores. Recent findings have suggested that these models may not operate in isolation but could work together to create planets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to investigate the implications of ISOs in planetary formation. Further research may clarify how these objects could provide a crucial role in the formation of giant planets before protoplanetary disks dissipate.</p>
