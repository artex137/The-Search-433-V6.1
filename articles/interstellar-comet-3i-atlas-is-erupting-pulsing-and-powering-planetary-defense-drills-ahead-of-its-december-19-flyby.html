      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Is Erupting, Pulsing and Powering Planetary-Defense Drills Ahead of Its December 19 Flyby</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, also known as C/2025 N1 (ATLAS), has been observed erupting and displaying unusual brightness patterns as it approaches its closest pass to Earth on December 19, 2025. As of December 2, 2025, there have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to the comet.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it has prompted a global planetary-defense exercise led by the United Nations, with 3I/ATLAS serving as a practice target. Authorities, including NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA), have reiterated that the comet poses no threat to Earth and presents a unique scientific opportunity for study.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Type:</strong> Interstellar comet (3I/ATLAS, C/2025 N1)</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery:</strong> July 1, 2025, by ATLAS in Río Hurtado, Chile</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Approximately 130,000–140,000 mph (210,000–220,000 km/h)</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to Earth:</strong> December 19, 2025, at around 1.8 AU (approximately 270 million km)</li>
    <li><strong>Brightness:</strong> Magnitude 10–11 in late November, requiring a telescope for observation</li>
    <li><strong>Age:</strong> Estimated at 7–14 billion years</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey telescope. It has since exhibited cryovolcanic activity and a unique brightness pattern. On October 29, 2025, the comet made its closest approach to the Sun, and it is expected to reach its closest point to Earth on December 19, 2025.</p>
<p>In late October, South Africa's MeerKAT radio telescope detected a pair of radio signals linked to the comet. These signals have been confirmed to originate from natural processes occurring within the comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS is a natural comet from another star system, and it poses no threat to Earth,” said representatives from NASA and ESA.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object to pass through the Solar System, following 1I/‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Its unique characteristics have sparked interest among scientists and astronomers worldwide, leading to extensive monitoring and study.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the comet approaches Earth, telescopes worldwide will continue to observe 3I/ATLAS to gather more data about its behavior and characteristics. Scientists aim to understand the links between its cryovolcanic activity and the observed radio signals.</p>
