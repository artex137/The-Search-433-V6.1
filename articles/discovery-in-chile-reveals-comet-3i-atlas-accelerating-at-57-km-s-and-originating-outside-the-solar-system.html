      <h2>Discovery in Chile reveals comet 3I/ATLAS accelerating at 57 km/s and originating outside the Solar System</h2>

<p>Astronomers from the Minor Planets Center have confirmed that comet 3I/ATLAS, detected on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile, originates from outside the Solar System. The comet travels at a speed of 57 km/s in a hyperbolic orbit, which prevents it from being captured by solar gravity. Authorities have indicated that the comet poses no risk to Earth as it moves through space.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as 3I/ATLAS is classified as the third interstellar visitor to be documented. Ongoing observations from various telescopes are providing insights into its composition and trajectory, with further studies planned to better understand its origins and behavior.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Detection Date:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Location of Detection:</strong> ATLAS telescope, Chile</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> 57 km/s</li>
    <li><strong>Perihelion Date:</strong> October 29, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance at Perihelion:</strong> 1.36 astronomical units</li>
    <li><strong>Current Status:</strong> Observed and monitored by telescopes</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the ATLAS telescope in Chile first detected comet 3I/ATLAS at a distance of 4.5 astronomical units from the Sun. Preliminary observations indicated a marginal coma and a three-arcsecond tail. By October 29, 2025, the comet reached perihelion at a distance of 1.36 astronomical units, situated between the orbits of Earth and Mars.</p>

<p>After perihelion, recent observations have confirmed that the comet continues to exhibit activity, including a bluish color resulting from a gaseous cloud formed by sublimation. Ground-based telescopes have monitored the comet's brightness and trajectory since November 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The hyperbolic orbit of 3I/ATLAS indicates that it is not bound to the Sun, reinforcing its classification as an interstellar object,” said a representative from the Minor Planets Center.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar visitor, following 'Oumuamua, detected in 2017, and Borisov, detected in 2019. Each of these comets has displayed unique characteristics, contributing to our understanding of objects originating from outside our Solar System.</p>

<p>The study of these interstellar objects offers insights into the composition and dynamics of other star systems, highlighting the diversity of materials found in the universe.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Ongoing observations of comet 3I/ATLAS will continue, with planned studies by the European Space Agency's Comet probe in November 2025 to map ejections and further analyze its composition.</p>
