      <h2>Comet C/2025 K1 ATLAS Breaks Apart in Space</h2>

<p>Comet C/2025 K1, known as the "other ATLAS," has exploded into pieces after reaching its closest point to the sun on October 8, 2023. The comet was discovered in May by astronomers at the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) and is now breaking apart in the constellation Leo.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it provides insights into the behavior of comets and their compositions. Astronomers have been monitoring C/2025 K1 closely, and new images have captured its dramatic disintegration. The ongoing observations may yield important data about the comet's unusual golden hue and its lack of carbon-bearing molecules.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet C/2025 K1 was discovered in May 2023.</li>
    <li>It reached perihelion on October 8, coming within 31 million miles (50 million kilometers) of the sun.</li>
    <li>On November 13, astronomers reported the comet had broken into several pieces.</li>
    <li>Four fragments have been identified, with three brighter pieces observed since early November.</li>
    <li>Observers can see the fragments in the constellation Leo with a telescope or binoculars.</li>
    <li>C/2025 K1 is one of the few comets with a golden hue.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet C/2025 K1 was discovered in May 2023 by ATLAS. It reached its perihelion on October 8, 2023. Initially, it appeared to have survived its close approach to the sun. However, on November 13, astronomers confirmed that the comet had broken apart into multiple fragments. Observations from November 12 to November 20 showed the separation of these pieces.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Following brightness surges in early November, we have been able to observe this comet splitting into three brighter fragments for the past two weeks,” said Austrian astrophotographer Michael Jäger.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>C/2025 K1 is part of a series of comets discovered by ATLAS, a NASA-funded survey program. Over the years, ATLAS has identified numerous comets, including C/2024 G3 and several others that have garnered public attention. The "other ATLAS" comet has gained interest due to its striking golden color, which is rare among comets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As C/2025 K1 continues to break apart, astronomers will monitor the fragments for further observations. Although researchers had hoped to study the comet's composition more closely during its closest approach to Earth on November 25, the disintegration complicates these plans.</p>
