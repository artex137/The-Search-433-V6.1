      <h2>JWST gets a closer look at interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed unexpectedly high levels of carbon dioxide emanating from the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, as observed in early August 2025. This comet, which has been moving through our solar system since its discovery in July, is one of the most carbon dioxide-rich comets ever recorded.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it may provide insights into the comet's origin, suggesting it formed in a different environment than that of our solar system. Astronomers, led by Martin Cordiner at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, are continuing to analyze the comet's unusual characteristics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered in July 2025.</li>
    <li>JWST observations conducted in early August 2025.</li>
    <li>Comet was approximately three times the distance from the sun as Earth during observations.</li>
    <li>Carbon dioxide to water ratio in the comet’s coma is 8 to 1.</li>
    <li>Carbon dioxide levels are 16 times higher than typical comets from our solar system.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first observed in July 2025, moving rapidly through our solar system. In early August 2025, Cordiner and his team utilized the JWST to capture detailed infrared images of the comet. Their findings indicated an unusual composition, particularly the high carbon dioxide levels.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The high levels of carbon dioxide could suggest that the comet formed in a planetary system where carbon dioxide ice was more common than water ice,” said Matthew Genge at Imperial College London.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“If 3I/ATLAS’s home star system blew away the water vapour from where comets were forming earlier than our own solar system, that could explain its unusual composition,” Genge added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable for its distinctive features that hint at an exotic origin. Unlike typical comets from our solar system, which show water-rich plumes of gas and dust at similar distances from the sun, 3I/ATLAS has shown a marked lack of water vapour. This raises questions about the conditions present during its formation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to study the data collected from JWST to further understand the implications of the high carbon dioxide levels and the comet's origin. No specific timeline for further observations has been disclosed.</p>
