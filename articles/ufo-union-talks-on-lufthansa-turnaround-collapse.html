      <h2>UFO Union: Talks on Lufthansa Turnaround Collapse</h2>

<p>Negotiations between Lufthansa and the UFO cabin crew union have collapsed, as the two parties failed to reach an agreement on restructuring efforts for the airline's main brand. The announcement was made on September 16, 2025, after UFO reported that management was not willing to engage in meaningful discussions regarding savings measures.</p>

<p>This development is significant as it affects over 19,000 flight attendants and indicates a setback in Lufthansa's plans to return to profitability following substantial losses last year. The airline's "turnaround" plan aims to improve operating profit by €2.5 billion annually by 2028, but UFO's withdrawal from negotiations may hinder these objectives.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date:</strong> September 16, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Union:</strong> UFO (Unabhängige Flugbegleiter Organisation)</li>
    <li><strong>Employees affected:</strong> 19,000 flight attendants</li>
    <li><strong>Projected profit improvement:</strong> €2.5 billion by 2028</li>
    <li><strong>Negotiations status:</strong> Failed</li>
    <li><strong>Effective termination of collective agreement:</strong> January 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Strike ballot for pilots' union:</strong> Running until September 30, 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>UFO has been in negotiations with Lufthansa management regarding the restructuring of the airline's core brand and its subsidiaries, which include Cityline, City Airlines, and Discover Airlines. The union sought savings measures as part of a comprehensive solution.</p>

<p>On September 16, UFO announced that talks had failed, with management accused of obstruction and threatening behavior. The union stated that instead of productive discussions, Lufthansa's proposals focused on increasing productivity by over 20 percent, which UFO deemed unacceptable.</p>

<p>As a result, UFO has terminated the collective agreement for the flight attendants, effective January 1, 2025, and will shift its focus to negotiating individual flight operation agreements.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“What we experienced was obstruction, delays, and threats,” UFO stated in a press release. “Instead of intelligent improvements, Lufthansa's proposals focused solely on productivity increases of more than 20 percent.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This collapse in negotiations comes as Lufthansa aims to implement a comprehensive turnaround plan following significant financial losses last year. The airline had previously announced that it would engage in talks with all social partners to address personnel costs as part of a broader strategy involving 700 measures.</p>

<p>Additionally, the pilots' union, Vereinigung Cockpit, is preparing for its own industrial action related to pension disputes, with a strike ballot currently open until September 30, 2025.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>With the collective agreement for flight attendants terminated, UFO will focus on traditional union work. Negotiations for individual flight operations are set to commence, while the pilots' union continues its strike preparations. There are no immediate plans for a UFO strike at this time.</p>
