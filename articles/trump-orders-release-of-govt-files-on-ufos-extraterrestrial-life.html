      <h2>Trump Orders Release of Govt Files on UFOs, Extraterrestrial Life</h2>

<p>President Donald Trump has announced plans to release United States government files related to unidentified flying objects, extraterrestrial life, and unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP). In a post on his verified X account, Trump stated he will direct the Secretary of War and other relevant agencies to identify and release records connected to the long-debated subject.</p>

<p>This announcement comes amid growing public interest in UFOs and possible extraterrestrial encounters in the United States. Authorities have acknowledged that the terminology surrounding these phenomena has shifted, with "UAP" now commonly used by defense and intelligence agencies. The move aims to address calls for greater transparency from Congress and the public regarding unidentified aerial encounters.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>President Trump announced the release on his verified X account.</li>
    <li>The Secretary of War and relevant agencies will oversee the process.</li>
    <li>The term "unidentified aerial phenomena" has replaced "UFO" in official language.</li>
    <li>In 2021, a report reviewed over 140 incidents reported by US military personnel.</li>
    <li>Many of these incidents remain unexplained, according to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In recent years, interest in UFOs has surged in the United States, particularly following government reviews and congressional hearings. In 2021, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence released a report detailing over 140 incidents involving military pilots and unidentified objects. Many cases were deemed unexplained, leading to further calls for transparency.</p>

<p>Prior to this announcement, members of Congress held multiple hearings featuring testimony from military and intelligence officials regarding unusual flight characteristics of some aerial objects. These developments have prompted the government to reconsider its approach to UFO-related information.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Based on the tremendous interest shown, I will be directing the Secretary of War, and other relevant Departments and Agencies, to begin the process of identifying and releasing Government files related to alien and extraterrestrial life, unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), and unidentified flying objects (UFOs),” Trump wrote.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Public fascination with UFOs in the United States has a long history, dating back to the Cold War era. Investigations like the Air Force’s Project Blue Book examined thousands of UFO sightings before it was closed in 1969. Recently, declassified military footage showing unidentified objects recorded by US Navy pilots has reignited global debate over governmental knowledge of unexplained aerial encounters.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The process for identifying and releasing the documents remains unclear. It is not disclosed which specific files will be made public or the timeline for their release. Authorities have indicated that the goal is to increase transparency regarding these complex and intriguing matters.</p>
