      <h2>NASA Captures Images of Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>
<p>NASA has captured images of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS from multiple locations, including Mars, deep space, and the Sun's edge, in a historic multi-mission campaign that began on July 1, 2025. The agency reported no injuries or fatalities associated with this observational effort.</p>

<p>This campaign marks a significant milestone in space observation, as it provides a comprehensive view of an interstellar object, enhancing our understanding of celestial bodies that originate beyond our solar system. NASA has confirmed that eight spacecraft participated in this effort, using various instruments to observe the comet in different wavelengths of light.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>First Observed:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to Earth:</strong> December 19, 2025, at a distance of 170 million miles</li>
    <li><strong>Key Spacecraft Involved:</strong> Perseverance rover, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO), MAVEN, Hubble Space Telescope, James Webb Space Telescope, Psyche, Lucy, STEREO, SOHO, PUNCH</li>
    <li><strong>Notable Image Capture:</strong> First comet imaged from the surface of another planet (Mars) on October 4, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Significance:</strong> 3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object to enter our solar system</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected by the NASA-funded ATLAS telescope in Chile on July 1, 2025. Following its discovery, various missions began tracking the comet. The Hubble Space Telescope and James Webb Space Telescope provided initial observations of the comet's light signature and motion. In early September, the Psyche spacecraft captured images of 3I/ATLAS from 33 million miles away. Shortly after, the Lucy mission took photographs from 240 million miles away.</p>
<p>On October 4, the Perseverance rover successfully photographed 3I/ATLAS from Jezero Crater as the comet passed within 30 million kilometers of Mars. As the comet moved behind the Sun in early October, NASA's heliophysics missions, including STEREO, SOHO, and PUNCH, tracked its movement and tail dynamics.</p>
<p>The campaign concluded with extensive data collection from multiple spacecraft, providing insights into the comet's characteristics and behavior.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Right now, we cannot travel to other planetary systems, but luckily, pieces come to us,” said Dr. Matthew Genge, a planetary scientist at Imperial College London. “In terms of studying the materials they’re made of, this is one of the most confident ways of accessing material from another planetary system.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“They pretty much confirm, as we thought all along, that it’s behaving like a comet, it looks like a comet, it moves like a comet—thus it’s a comet,” Dr. Genge added regarding the observations of 3I/ATLAS.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is significant as it is likely twice as old as our solar system, providing insights into the formation of other planetary systems. This campaign has highlighted the capability of NASA's spacecraft to adapt instruments for tracking interstellar objects, paving the way for future studies of similar celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth on December 19, 2025. Further analysis of the data collected will provide additional insights into the comet's composition and behavior, with potential implications for future interstellar object missions.</p>
