      <h2>3I/ATLAS: NASA to Release Images Following Congressional Pressure</h2>

<p>NASA has acknowledged Harvard astrophysicist Dr. Avi Loeb's observations regarding the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, according to US Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna. In a recent statement, Luna revealed that NASA plans to release images and data of 3I/ATLAS once the government reopens, although no specific date has been provided.</p>

<p>This development is significant as 3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object detected, and studying it could enhance understanding of celestial bodies beyond our solar system. Luna has previously urged NASA for transparency regarding the data associated with 3I/ATLAS, emphasizing the importance of this information for scientific advancement.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was last observed near the Sun on October 30, 2025.</li>
    <li>The object is currently about 270 million km from Earth.</li>
    <li>NASA has not disclosed an exact release date for the images.</li>
    <li>The European Space Agency’s JUICE mission will monitor 3I/ATLAS from November 2 to 25, 2025.</li>
    <li>Loeb's analysis suggests the comet may exhibit unusual behavior indicative of artificial control.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In a letter to acting NASA administrator Sean Duffy, Congresswoman Luna expressed the need for transparency regarding 3I/ATLAS. Following her discussions with NASA, Luna confirmed that the agency has noted Loeb's observations of the comet's abnormal tail.</p>
<p>Dr. Loeb has pointed out that the comet displayed an unusual "anti-tail," which deviates from typical comet behavior. His observations raise questions about whether 3I/ATLAS is a natural comet or an engineered object.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Dr. Avi Loeb was correct in his early analysis of the abnormal tail. NASA has also noted this,” said Congresswoman Luna.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“This information is of great importance to advancing our understanding of interstellar visitors and their interaction with our solar system,” Luna added in her letter to NASA.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is significant as it is only the third interstellar object confirmed to date. Scientists believe it contains carbon dioxide-rich materials, providing insights into the formation of such bodies in distant, icy regions of the galaxy.</p>
<p>Loeb's claims about the comet's tail behavior challenge traditional understandings of cometary features and suggest a need for further investigation into the nature of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA is expected to release images and data of 3I/ATLAS once the government reopens. The European Space Agency will also continue monitoring the comet, with data anticipated by February 2026.</p>
