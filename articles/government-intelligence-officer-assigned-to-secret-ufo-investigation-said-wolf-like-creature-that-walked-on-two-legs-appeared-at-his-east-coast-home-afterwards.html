      <h2>Government intelligence officer assigned to secret UFO investigation 'said wolf-like creature that walked on two legs appeared at his East Coast home afterwards'</h2>

<p>A former intelligence officer with the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) has reported a bizarre encounter with a wolf-like creature at his home on the East Coast after investigating UFOs. Dr. James Lacatski, who directed the Advanced Aerospace Weapon System Applications Program (AAWSAP), revealed these details during an interview with journalist George Knapp, broadcast on a local CBS affiliate on December 12, 2025.</p>

<p>This matter has raised concerns about the potential links between UFO sightings and paranormal experiences. Authorities have been investigating these claims, particularly those associated with the AAWSAP, which was established to explore UFO technology and related phenomena.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Individual involved:</strong> Dr. James Lacatski, former intelligence analyst, DIA</li>
    <li><strong>Program:</strong> Advanced Aerospace Weapon System Applications Program (AAWSAP)</li>
    <li><strong>Location of incident:</strong> East Coast, USA</li>
    <li><strong>Year of program launch:</strong> 2008</li>
    <li><strong>Key witness accounts:</strong> At least five intelligence officers reported paranormal experiences</li>
    <li><strong>Funding support:</strong> Secured by late Senator Harry Reid</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The AAWSAP was launched in 2008 after DIA officials noted a surge in UFO sightings and related paranormal phenomena in the Uinta Basin, Utah. This program involved a team of intelligence officers tasked with investigating UFO technology and the effects of these encounters.</p>
<p>Dr. Lacatski has reported that many team members experienced strange occurrences, including sightings of mysterious orbs and shadowy figures. One officer, upon returning home, claimed to have seen a wolf-like creature walking on two legs, highlighting the unusual nature of these experiences.</p>
<p>These claims have prompted continued interest from both the public and authorities, as they explore the implications of such encounters.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We realized that people who openly say 'I observed a UFO up close' always seemed to have a paranormal connection,” said Dr. James Lacatski during his interview.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“There was physical evidence left behind; it left deep scratch marks on the tree it was resting against,” Lacatski added, referring to the creature sighting.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The AAWSAP was established in response to increasing reports of UFO sightings and related phenomena, particularly in areas like the Uinta Basin, which has a history of bizarre activity. The program initially focused on UFO technology but expanded to consider the potential health effects and psychological implications of these experiences.</p>
<p>Past incidents involving military personnel and unexplained phenomena have also contributed to ongoing investigations into the nature of these encounters, raising questions about their potential implications for national security.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the reported encounters and their implications are ongoing. Authorities continue to examine the data collected through the AAWSAP and related projects, seeking to understand the full scope of these phenomena.</p>
