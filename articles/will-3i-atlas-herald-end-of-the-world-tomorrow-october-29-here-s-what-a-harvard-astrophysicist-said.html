      <h2>Will 3I/ATLAS Herald End Of The World Tomorrow, October 29?</h2>

<p>3I/ATLAS, a comet making its way through the solar system, has raised concerns among some academics and the public, with speculation about its potential impact on Earth intensifying as it approaches its perihelion on October 29, 2025. Harvard astrophysicist Prof. Avi Loeb has suggested that the comet, measuring about 5 kilometers in diameter, could be operated by extraterrestrial intelligence. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this event.</p>

<p>The significance of 3I/ATLAS lies in its trajectory and the theories surrounding its nature. Authorities and scientists are monitoring its approach, while discussions about its potential implications for humanity have gained traction on social media.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS has a perihelion distance of 203 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>It travels at a speed of over 96 kilometers per hour.</li>
    <li>Prof. Avi Loeb has raised concerns about a possible “Oberth maneuver” as a black swan event.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will be hidden from view behind the Sun at perihelion.</li>
    <li>It will receive over 33 gigawatts of solar power at perihelion.</li>
    <li>Loeb has advised taking vacations before October 29 due to uncertainties surrounding the comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been identified as the third interstellar visitor to enter the solar system since 1I/Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. As it approaches its perihelion on October 29, 2025, various conspiracy theories about its origins and purpose have surfaced, particularly on social media. Notable figures, including Prof. Avi Loeb and science educator Michio Kaku, have commented on the comet's potential implications.</p>

<p>On October 20, 2025, a video featuring Loeb gained attention, where he warned about the comet's approach and its possible technological implications. Social media users have circulated theories suggesting that the comet may be a remnant of ancient human technology or even a vessel for extraterrestrial beings.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“On October 29, 2025, 3I/ATLAS will reach a perihelion distance of 203 million kilometers,” said Prof. Avi Loeb. “Given the minimum diameter of 5 kilometers for 3I/ATLAS, the solar illumination at perihelion would deliver more than 33 gigawatts of power to its surface.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>Loeb further stated, “I don’t know if there will be meaning to money if this object turns out to be technological after October 29th. If you want to take a vacation, take it before that date. Because who knows what will happen?”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is part of a growing interest in interstellar objects since the discovery of 1I/Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. The notion of extraterrestrial life and advanced technologies has sparked numerous theories, with some academics cautioning against jumping to conclusions without sufficient evidence.</p>

<p>The discussions surrounding 3I/ATLAS reflect ongoing fascination and fear about the unknown, particularly regarding celestial events and their potential impact on humanity.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches its perihelion, scientists will continue to monitor its trajectory and behavior. The possibility of further research and analysis of the comet's characteristics remains open, but no formal investigations or charges have been initiated at this time.</p>
