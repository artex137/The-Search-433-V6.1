      <h2>3I/ATLAS Shows Baffling Speed Boost—The Mystery Just Got Worse</h2>

<p>3I/ATLAS, an interstellar object, has exhibited an unexplained acceleration as it travels through our solar system. The object reached its closest approach to the Sun on October 30, 2025, and is currently moving at over <strong>210,000 kilometres per hour</strong> (130,000 mph). There have been no injuries or fatalities reported related to this astronomical phenomenon.</p>

<p>The unusual behaviour of 3I/ATLAS has drawn the attention of scientists and, reportedly, the US Congress. Dr. Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist, has claimed that the object has "clearly maneuvered," suggesting its acceleration is unlike any natural comet behavior previously observed. Researchers are now using advanced telescopes to study the object before it permanently leaves the solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to Sun:</strong> October 30, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Current Speed:</strong> Over 210,000 km/h (130,000 mph)</li>
    <li><strong>Expected Closest Approach to Earth:</strong> December 19, 2025, at approximately 270 million km away</li>
    <li><strong>Size:</strong> Over 5 km in diameter, exceeding 33 billion tons</li>
    <li><strong>Observation Tools:</strong> James Webb Space Telescope, ESA's JUICE mission</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS, an interstellar visitor, has sparked scientific intrigue since its first observations. The timeline of its notable events includes:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>October 30, 2025:</strong> 3I/ATLAS makes its closest approach to the Sun, exhibiting unexpected acceleration.</li>
    <li><strong>December 19, 2025:</strong> The object is expected to make its closest approach to Earth at a safe distance of approximately 270 million km.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The sudden boost in speed was equal to the thrust from a jet expelling five billion tons of material,” said Dr. Avi Loeb, highlighting the object's unusual acceleration.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is not the first interstellar object to be observed. Previous visitors, such as 'Oumuamua, have shown only minor accelerations without the same level of mystery. The lack of a conventional comet tail further complicates the understanding of 3I/ATLAS, which has led to debates on whether it is a natural phenomenon or something more unusual.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers are racing against time to gather data on 3I/ATLAS as it moves away from the Sun and Earth. The scientific community is focused on determining whether the object is a natural comet or a sign of non-human technology. The findings in the coming weeks could significantly impact our understanding of the universe.</p>
