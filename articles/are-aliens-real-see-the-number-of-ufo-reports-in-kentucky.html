      <h2>UFO reports in Kentucky raise questions about extraterrestrial life</h2>
<p>Former President Barack Obama has jokingly confirmed the existence of aliens during a podcast interview with host Brian Tyler Cohen on February 14, 2023. Obama later clarified that he has seen no evidence of extraterrestrial contact during his presidency. Kentucky has reported 1,813 UFO sightings since 1995, according to the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC).</p>

<p>This recent discussion has reignited interest in UFO sightings, particularly in Kentucky, where officials are analyzing reports and trends. The NUFORC has collected over 180,000 reports since its establishment in 1974, indicating a significant public interest in unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On February 14, 2023, during a lightning round of questions on a podcast, Barack Obama humorously confirmed the existence of aliens but later stated he had not seen evidence of their existence while in office.

<p>Since 1995, the NUFORC has logged 1,813 UFO sightings in Kentucky, contributing to the larger total of over 180,000 reports nationwide.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“They’re real, but I haven’t seen them," Obama said during the podcast. "They’re not being kept at Area 51. There’s no underground facility, unless there’s this enormous conspiracy, and they hid it from the president of the United States.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Statistically, the universe is so vast that the odds are good there’s life out there,” Obama stated on Instagram. “But the distances between solar systems are so great that the chances we’ve been visited by aliens is low, and I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. Really!”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The interest in UFOs has grown significantly over the years, with many individuals reporting sightings and unusual occurrences. The NUFORC, founded in 1974, serves as a repository for these reports, which often lead to public fascination and speculation about extraterrestrial life.

<h2>What’s next</h2>
