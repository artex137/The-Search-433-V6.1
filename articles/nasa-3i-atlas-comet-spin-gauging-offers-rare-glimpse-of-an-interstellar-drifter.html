      <h2>NASA 3I/ATLAS Comet Spin Gauging Offers Rare Glimpse of an Interstellar Drifter</h2>

<p>NASA scientists are studying interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it speeds away from the solar system following observations made by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) from January 15 to January 22, 2023. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This research is significant because it may provide insights into the origins and composition of this rare visitor from another star system. TESS has captured detailed data about the comet, which scientists believe will help decode its physical characteristics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Observation period: January 15 to January 22, 2023</li>
    <li>Location: Solar system, as the comet moves outward</li>
    <li>Data source: NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS)</li>
    <li>Researcher: Daniel Muthukrishna, Massachusetts Institute of Technology</li>
    <li>Video duration: 28 hours</li>
    <li>TESS briefly entered "safe mode" between January 15 and January 18</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>From January 15 to January 22, 2023, TESS monitored comet 3I/ATLAS. During this period, the spacecraft tracked the comet as it moved through the solar system, capturing images that led to the creation of a 28-hour video of its path. However, TESS briefly entered "safe mode" due to an issue with its solar panels, resulting in a gap in the data collected between January 15 and January 18.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This dataset is a scientific gold mine,” said Daniel Muthukrishna, highlighting the potential discoveries that could emerge from the observations.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interstellar comets are rare, and 3I/ATLAS presents a unique opportunity for researchers to study an object originating from outside the solar system. Past observations of such comets have offered valuable insights into the composition and behavior of these celestial bodies, but 3I/ATLAS may provide even more detailed data due to its recent observations.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA scientists continue to analyze the data collected from TESS to better understand the comet's composition and behavior as it travels away from the solar system. Further results from the spin gauging may be released in the coming months.</p>
