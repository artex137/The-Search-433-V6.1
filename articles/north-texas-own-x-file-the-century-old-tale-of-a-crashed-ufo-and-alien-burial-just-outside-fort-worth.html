      <h2>North Texas' Own X-File: The Century-Old Tale Of A Crashed UFO And Alien Burial Just Outside Fort Worth</h2>

<p>On April 17, 1897, an unidentified flying object crashed in Aurora, Texas, revealing a pilot described as "not of this world." The incident occurred early in the morning and resulted in an explosion that scattered debris over several acres. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This incident matters as it predates the more widely known Roswell event by half a century. Authorities and researchers have continued to investigate the claims surrounding the crash, although skepticism remains regarding the authenticity of the story.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Crash date: April 17, 1897</li>
    <li>Location: Aurora, Texas</li>
    <li>Population at the time: approximately 300 residents</li>
    <li>Debris reportedly disposed of in a well</li>
    <li>Well sealed in 1945 by property owner Brawley Oats</li>
    <li>Initial report published by S.E. Haydon in the Dallas Morning News</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On April 17, 1897, townspeople in Aurora observed a cigar-shaped flying craft traveling north before it crashed into a windmill. The crash resulted in an explosion and debris scattered across the area. Witnesses discovered a pilot, described as badly disfigured, who was determined to be extraterrestrial. The townsfolk buried the pilot in Aurora Cemetery with Christian rites. Over the years, the grave marker has disappeared, leaving the site unmarked.</p>

<p>In the aftermath, the wreckage was reportedly disposed of in a well on the property where the crash occurred. This well was later sealed in 1945 due to concerns about contamination and strange side effects reported by those who consumed the water.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Enough of the original [had] been picked up to show that he was not an inhabitant of this world,” wrote S.E. Haydon in the Dallas Morning News.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Aurora UFO incident coincided with a wave of “Mystery Airship” sightings across Texas during 1896 and 1897. Skeptics have suggested that the crash may have been a hoax, with some claiming that Haydon fabricated the story to gain attention for Aurora.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The Aurora Cemetery Association has denied multiple requests from experts to exhume the purported extraterrestrial remains, leaving the story shrouded in mystery and speculation.</p>
