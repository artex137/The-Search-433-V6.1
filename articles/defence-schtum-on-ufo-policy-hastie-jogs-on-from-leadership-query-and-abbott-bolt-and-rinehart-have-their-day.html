      <h2>Defence schtum on 'UFO' policy, Hastie jogs on from leadership query, and Abbott, Bolt and Rinehart have their day</h2>

<p>The Australian government's stance on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP), commonly referred to as UFOs, remains unclear as public interest grows. Recent discussions have emerged following a US Congressional hearing in 2023, where a former intelligence official alleged a government cover-up concerning evidence of UAPs. This statement has heightened scrutiny around the Australian Defence Department's approach to the phenomenon.</p>

<p>The lack of transparency from the Australian government contrasts sharply with recent developments in the United States, prompting questions about the existence and investigation of UAPs in Australia. Authorities have not disclosed their current policies or findings regarding UAPs, despite increasing public and media interest.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>UAP discussions have intensified following a 2023 US Congressional hearing.</li>
    <li>A former intelligence official alleged a government cover-up of proof regarding UAPs.</li>
    <li>Recent betting trends indicate a public expectation that Donald Trump will declassify UAP-related documents this year.</li>
    <li>The Australian Defence Department has not provided information on its UAP policy.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2023, a US Congressional hearing took place where allegations of a government cover-up regarding UAPs were made by a former intelligence official. This event has led to increased public interest and speculation about UAPs globally.</p>
<p>In January 2026, reports noted a spike in betting on prediction markets that Donald Trump would declassify documents related to UAPs.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The truth is out there,” a commentary noted, reflecting the ongoing public fascination with UAPs and the unanswered questions surrounding them.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Over the past few years, there has been a significant increase in public interest regarding UFOs, now referred to as UAPs. This shift has been driven by various events, including the US Congressional hearings and heightened media coverage. The Australian government has not matched this level of openness, maintaining a more reserved stance on the subject.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The Australian Defence Department’s future actions regarding UAP investigations remain unclear, as no timeline or specific plans have been disclosed to the public.</p>
