      <h2>Searching for technologies on interstellar object 3I/ATLAS: the latest results</h2>

<p>A team of astronomers has investigated comet 3I/ATLAS using the Green Bank Telescope, aiming to determine whether the object, which has passed through our solar system, could harbor technological signals. The analysis took place as the comet moves away from Earth, raising questions about its nature and origin.</p>

<p>This investigation is significant as it continues the search for potential artificial signals from interstellar objects. The Green Bank Telescope, part of the Breakthrough Listen project, mobilized considerable resources to detect any radio emissions from 3I/ATLAS. Despite the lack of detection, the study contributes to understanding the formation of comets outside our solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS has passed through the solar system three times in recent years.</li>
    <li>The Green Bank Telescope has a sensitivity capable of detecting signals as low as 0.1 watt.</li>
    <li>During the analysis, nine signals were identified but attributed to terrestrial sources.</li>
    <li>Benjamin Jacobson-Bell is affiliated with the University of California.</li>
    <li>The upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory is expected to discover more interstellar objects.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has been identified as the third interstellar visitor to pass through our solar system. The Green Bank Telescope, known for its exceptional sensitivity, was directed toward the comet to search for technological signals. The analysis resulted in the identification of nine signals, all of which were confirmed to be from Earth.</p>

<p>Despite initial modest expectations, researchers emphasized the importance of rigorous checks to differentiate between terrestrial and extraterrestrial emissions. The study reflects ongoing scientific interest in interstellar objects and their implications for understanding cosmic processes.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“These checks remain essential, despite initially modest expectations,” said Benjamin Jacobson-Bell, from the University of California.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The investigation into 3I/ATLAS aligns with a broader trend in astronomy to monitor interstellar objects for potential signs of artificial origins. Previous interstellar visitors have sparked similar inquiries, highlighting the scientific community's ongoing curiosity about the cosmos and the possibility of extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to examine the characteristics of interstellar objects like 3I/ATLAS to enhance understanding of cosmic phenomena. Future observations, particularly with the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, are anticipated to yield further discoveries in the field.</p>
