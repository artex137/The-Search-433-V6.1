      <h2>New image shows 3I/ATLAS' tail stretching further, intriguing scientists</h2>

<p>New images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS have shown its tail expanding as it travels through the inner solar system, according to observations made on November 10, 2025. The images, captured by Gianluca Masi, founder of the Virtual Telescope Project, reveal increased activity in the comet as it re-emerges from behind the Sun.</p>

<p>This development is significant for astronomers studying the comet's behavior and composition. Authorities and researchers are closely monitoring 3I/ATLAS as it continues to release gas and dust, which could provide insights into its origins and the conditions of its home star system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was observed at 11:31 p.m. EDT on November 10, 2025.</li>
    <li>The observation was made from Manciano, Italy, using robotic telescopes.</li>
    <li>The ion tail spanned at least 0.7 degrees in the northeast direction.</li>
    <li>The comet was 14 degrees above the eastern horizon during the observation.</li>
    <li>The images were composed of 18 separate 120-second exposures.</li>
    <li>The bright Moon was approximately 70 degrees away from the comet.</li>
    <li>This comet is the third confirmed interstellar object detected, following 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 10, 2025, Gianluca Masi captured images of 3I/ATLAS as it re-emerged from behind the Sun, revealing a larger ion tail and increased activity. The comet was observed during a nearly full Moon, which presented challenges due to lunar glare. However, Masi successfully achieved observation despite the conditions.</p>

<p>The next day, further observations were made, taking advantage of unusually good weather. The bright core of the comet was surrounded by a compact coma, and the sharply defined ion tail was prominent in the sky. This increase in activity suggested that the comet was ejecting gas and dust more vigorously due to solar heating.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “An extremely bright (almost full) Moon was setting, with the target just 10 degrees above the eastern horizon,” said Gianluca Masi, reflecting on the observation conditions.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “The comet was 12 degrees above the eastern horizon, with a bright Moon about 85 degrees from it,” Masi added, highlighting the visibility of the comet's tail.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable for being the third confirmed interstellar object detected, following 1I/'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. The comet is believed to originate from another star system, and its current observations could provide valuable data regarding the composition and conditions of that distant planetary system.</p>

<p>Previous studies of 3I/ATLAS suggested a high content of carbon dioxide ice, which may offer clues about its formation and the environment of its home star system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it travels through the solar system, analyzing the data collected from its increased activity. Future observations may yield more information about the comet's composition and origins.</p>
