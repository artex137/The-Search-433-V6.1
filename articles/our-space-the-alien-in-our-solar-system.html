      <h2>OUR SPACE: The alien in our solar system</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar visitor from outside our solar system, is making its closest approach near Mars in mid-September 2025. This comet, discovered by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS), is not expected to pose any threat to Earth.</p>

<p>The significance of 3I/ATLAS lies in its classification as the third known interstellar object observed. NASA and various space agencies, including the Perseverance and Curiosity rovers, are mobilizing their assets to gather data on this ancient celestial body, which could be nearly twice as old as our solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in mid-June 2025.</li>
    <li>It is making a close approach to Mars in mid-September 2025.</li>
    <li>NASA is deploying multiple assets, including the Perseverance and Curiosity rovers, for observations.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is classified as a comet, containing volatile icy elements.</li>
    <li>It is the third interstellar visitor ever confirmed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In June 2025, astronomers using the ATLAS project detected a moving object in the sky. After detailed observations, it was confirmed as an interstellar comet, leading to its designation as 3I/ATLAS. Since then, various space agencies have prepared to observe the comet during its closest approach to Mars.</p>

<p>On September 2025, Comet 3I/ATLAS is set to make its closest approach, allowing multiple space missions to gather data and analyze its composition.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We will never see this space rock again, so it’s a one-time-only chance to gather all the data we can,” said Beate Czogalla, Professor of Theater Design and a Solar System Ambassador for NASA.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS follows the discovery of ‘Oumuamua, the first confirmed interstellar object, in 2017. Unlike ‘Oumuamua, which was cigar-shaped, 3I/ATLAS is a comet with icy elements that create a tail as it approaches the sun.</p>

<p>Comets often leave behind debris trails that can result in meteor showers on Earth, a phenomenon caused when Earth passes through the fine dust particles shed by comets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As Comet 3I/ATLAS approaches Mars, space agencies will continue to track and observe the comet, collecting data that will be analyzed long after its departure from the solar system.</p>
