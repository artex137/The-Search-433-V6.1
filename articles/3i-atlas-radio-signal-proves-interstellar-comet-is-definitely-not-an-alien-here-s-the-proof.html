      <h2>3I/ATLAS Radio Signal Proves Interstellar Comet Is Definitely Not an Alien - Here's the Proof</h2>

<p>Astronomers have confirmed that the radio signals detected from the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS are natural in origin, ending weeks of speculation regarding its potential as an alien spacecraft. The confirmation follows observations made using the MeerKAT radio telescope array in South Africa on 24 October 2025, just after the comet reappeared from behind the Sun.</p>

<p>This discovery matters as it clarifies the nature of 3I/ATLAS and alleviates concerns about possible extraterrestrial technology. Experts have noted that the emissions correspond to known cometary processes, reinforcing the idea that the object is a typical comet rather than an artificial construct.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of radio signal detection: 24 October 2025</li>
    <li>Location of observations: MeerKAT radio telescope array, South Africa</li>
    <li>Frequencies of detected signals: 1.665 and 1.667 gigahertz</li>
    <li>Composition: hydroxyl radicals (OH molecules)</li>
    <li>Mass loss: 13% during its passage near the Sun</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 24 October 2025, astronomers detected radio emissions from 3I/ATLAS using the MeerKAT telescope. These signals indicated the presence of hydroxyl radicals formed by sunlight interacting with water vapour in the comet's coma. Initial excitement about the possibility of an alien probe was quickly tempered as scientists provided context for the emissions.</p>
<p>Subsequent analysis confirmed that the detected signals matched those typically associated with cometary outgassing, which is a common phenomenon among active comets.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It looks like a comet and it behaves like a comet. There is no reason to think it is something else.”</blockquote>
<p>— Planetary scientist, as reported by The Guardian.</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This recent analysis follows a pattern seen with previous interstellar objects, such as Oumuamua in 2017, which also sparked speculation about artificial origins. While 3I/ATLAS has shown unusual features, experts emphasize that such anomalies do not imply extraterrestrial technology.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to study 3I/ATLAS to better understand its composition and the mechanisms behind its unusual characteristics. No evidence suggests an artificial origin, and the comet remains a valuable subject for scientific inquiry into interstellar objects.</p>
