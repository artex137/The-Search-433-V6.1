      <h2>NASA reveals organic molecules in comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>NASA has disclosed new images of comet 3I/ATLAS, revealing the presence of organic molecules and evidence of a late eruption. The findings come as the comet approaches its closest point to Earth, scheduled for February 14, 2026.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant because it provides insight into the composition of comets and their role in the solar system's formation. NASA scientists are analyzing the data to understand better the implications of these organic compounds for the origins of life on Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is set to reach its closest point to Earth on February 14, 2026.</li>
    <li>New images have shown organic molecules present on the comet.</li>
    <li>The comet has exhibited signs of a late eruption, according to NASA.</li>
    <li>NASA is actively studying the data collected from the comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>NASA has been monitoring comet 3I/ATLAS since its discovery in 2019. Recent observations have led to the identification of organic molecules and a late eruption, enhancing understanding of the comet's behavior and structure.</p>
<p>The closest approach to Earth will occur in February 2026, allowing for further observation and analysis by astronomers and scientists.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The presence of organic molecules in comet 3I/ATLAS is a remarkable finding that could shed light on the building blocks of life,” said a NASA scientist involved in the research.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is part of a broader group of comets that scientists study to learn more about the early solar system. Previous comets have also shown signs of organic compounds, prompting ongoing research into their significance for understanding life on Earth.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA plans to continue its analysis of the data from comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth, with further updates expected following the close encounter in February 2026.</p>
