      <h2>Do aliens exist? Obama says 'odds are good' – but they're not at Area 51</h2>

<p>Former President Barack Obama has confirmed the possibility of extraterrestrial life in a podcast interview on February 14, 2026, but dismissed the idea that aliens are being held at Area 51, a classified U.S. Air Force facility in Nevada. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with his statements.</p>

<p>Obama's comments come at a time when public interest in UFOs—now referred to as Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs)—has surged, particularly following recent government hearings. These discussions have raised questions about the U.S. government's transparency regarding UFO sightings and the potential existence of life beyond Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of interview: February 14, 2026</li>
    <li>Location: Podcast hosted by Brian Tyler Cohen</li>
    <li>Key statement: "They’re real, but I haven’t seen them."</li>
    <li>Clarification made on Instagram: February 15, 2026</li>
    <li>Public perception: Nearly half of Americans believe the U.S. government is concealing information about UFOs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On February 14, 2026, Obama participated in a lightning round of questions during a podcast with Brian Tyler Cohen. When asked about aliens, he acknowledged their potential existence but denied any connection to Area 51.</p>
<p>Following the interview, on February 15, Obama posted a clarification on Instagram, stating, "Statistically, the universe is so vast that the odds are good there’s life out there," while also emphasizing the low likelihood of contact with extraterrestrials during his presidency.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“They’re real, but I haven’t seen them. They’re not being kept at Area 51. There’s no underground facility, unless there’s this enormous conspiracy, and they hid it from the president of the United States.” - Barack Obama</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Statistically, the universe is so vast that the odds are good there’s life out there. But the distances between solar systems are so great that the chances we’ve been visited by aliens is low, and I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. Really!” - Barack Obama</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interest in the existence of extraterrestrial life has been ongoing for decades. Recent hearings on UAPs have intensified scrutiny over the government's handling of UFO sightings. The Department of War has indicated that many UAP sightings can often be attributed to identifiable objects such as planes, balloons, or drones.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As investigations into UAP sightings continue, authorities are expected to maintain transparency and provide updates to the public regarding any findings related to unidentified phenomena.</p>
