      <h2>Alien comet? Everything we know about 3i/Atlas, the web phenomenon</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3i/Atlas is currently passing through our solar system, having been discovered by the ATLAS (Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System). This comet has generated significant interest and discussion among internet users and scientists alike due to its unusual characteristics and origin. There are no reported injuries or fatalities associated with 3i/Atlas.</p>

<p>This comet is noteworthy because it may have originated in the thick disk of the Milky Way, potentially making it older than the Solar System itself. Authorities, including NASA and the National Observatory, have stated there is no cause for concern regarding its trajectory, as it is safely passing at a distance of approximately 270 million kilometers from Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3i/Atlas discovered by ATLAS</li>
    <li>Current speed of approximately <strong>210,000 km/h</strong></li>
    <li>Passed at a safe distance of <strong>270 million kilometers</strong> from Earth</li>
    <li>Estimated age of at least <strong>7 billion years</strong></li>
    <li>Detected coma dominated by carbon dioxide (CO₂), water, and carbon monoxide (CO)</li>
    <li>Hyperbolic trajectory indicates a low chance of returning to the solar system</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3i/Atlas has traveled through the Milky Way and is currently on its way out of the solar system. Observations have revealed that as it approaches the Sun, its solid core is turning into gas, forming a coma of dust and gas. This process has allowed astronomers to gather unprecedented data about the comet's composition and origin.</p>
<p>The James Webb Space Telescope has played a crucial role in detecting the comet's unique chemical makeup, which differs significantly from other comets, suggesting a formation under different conditions.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“There is no cause for concern,” said representatives from NASA and the National Observatory regarding the comet's trajectory.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb raised a hypothesis about the comet's activity and shape, suggesting compatibility with alien technology, although this claim has been disputed by the majority of the scientific community.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3i/Atlas has sparked a mix of scientific inquiry and speculation across social media platforms. While many users have shared theories regarding its nature, the scientific community remains focused on understanding its origins and characteristics based on observational data.</p>
<p>This comet serves as a reminder of the ongoing exploration of our solar system and the intriguing objects that can be found within it.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3i/Atlas continues its journey out of the solar system, astronomers will continue to analyze the data collected from observations. Further studies may provide more insights into its unique composition and origins, but no immediate actions or investigations are planned as it poses no threat to Earth.</p>
