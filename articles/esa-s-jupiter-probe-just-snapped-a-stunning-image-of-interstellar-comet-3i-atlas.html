      <h2>ESA's Jupiter Probe Captures Stunning Image of Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>A European Space Agency (ESA) spacecraft has captured a new image of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS while en route to Jupiter. The image, taken by the JUICE probe, reveals significant activity around the comet. This marks the third known interstellar object detected in our Solar System.</p>

<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS is significant as it provides scientists with a rare opportunity to study a comet that may have originated from outside our Solar System. The full data set from the JUICE probe's instruments will not arrive on Earth until early 2026, prompting scientists to monitor the comet closely with various telescopes and spacecraft.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was identified by the ATLAS telescope system in Chile on 1 July 2025.</li>
    <li>JUICE probe captured the first image of the comet using its Navigation Camera on 2 November 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet has a hyperbolic orbit and is not part of our Solar System.</li>
    <li>The full scientific data from JUICE is expected to arrive in February 2026.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS has shown signs of activity, including a glowing halo and two tails.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 1 July 2025, the ATLAS telescope system in Chile first detected interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS. The JUICE probe, designed to investigate the icy moons of Jupiter, redirected its focus to the comet between 2 and 25 November 2025. On 2 November, the Navigation Camera of JUICE captured its first image of the comet, revealing significant activity.</p>

<p>Following the comet's closest approach to the Sun, known as perihelion, the JUICE probe observed the comet during a period of heightened activity.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The very clearly visible comet, surrounded by signs of activity, surprised us,” said the JUICE team. “Not only do we clearly see the glowing halo of gas surrounding the comet known as its coma, we also see a hint of two tails.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to the discovery of 3I/ATLAS, only two interstellar comets had been validated: 1I/'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. The rarity of such comets makes 3I/ATLAS a valuable subject for study, as it may provide insights into the building blocks of planetary systems beyond our own.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers are awaiting the arrival of data from all five scientific instruments aboard the JUICE probe. They aim to gather high-resolution images and analyze the comet's composition, which may reveal whether 3I/ATLAS contains unusual ices and materials not typically found in Solar System comets.</p>
