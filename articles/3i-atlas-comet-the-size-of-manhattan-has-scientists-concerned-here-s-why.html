      <h2>3I/ATLAS: Comet the size of Manhattan has scientists concerned – Here’s why</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, roughly the size of Manhattan, is set to reach its closest point to the Sun on Wednesday, 29 October 2025, according to NASA. The comet, measuring up to 5.6 kilometres in diameter, poses no threat to Earth, but its unusual behaviour has raised concerns among scientists.</p>

<p>This event matters because it will significantly alter the comet's appearance and composition. NASA has confirmed that the comet will pass just 1.4 astronomical units (about 210 million kilometres) from the Sun, slightly inside Mars’s orbit. Observations will provide valuable insights into the comet's reaction to solar energy and its chemical makeup.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered on 1 July 2025 by NASA’s ATLAS survey telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>Expected closest approach to the Sun: 29 October 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest distance to Earth: 1.8 astronomical units (about 270 million kilometres).</li>
    <li>Estimated speed upon detection: 221,000 kilometres per hour.</li>
    <li>Diameter: up to 5.6 kilometres.</li>
    <li>Monitoring by NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope, James Webb Space Telescope, and planetary probes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected on 1 July 2025. Since then, it has been travelling on a hyperbolic path through the solar system. NASA reports that the comet will reach perihelion on 29 October 2025, passing close to the Sun. After this encounter, it is expected to pass near Jupiter in March 2026 before disappearing from view by late 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “3I/ATLAS presents a rare opportunity for coordinated global observation,” said the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN), highlighting the scientific value of studying the comet under extreme solar conditions.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb remarked, “The object could weigh as much as 33 billion tons,” suggesting it is significantly more massive than previous interstellar visitors.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is classified as the third interstellar object ever detected. Previous objects, such as 2017’s ‘Oumuamua and 2019’s 2I/Borisov, have been less massive and displayed different characteristics. The unusual activity of 3I/ATLAS has sparked debate among scientists regarding its origin and nature.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun, studying its shape, brightness, and chemical composition. This ongoing observation will provide unprecedented insights into an object originating from beyond our solar system.</p>
