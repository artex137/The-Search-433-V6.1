      <h2>US Air Force pilot reports close encounter with ‘football-sized’ UFO in California</h2>

<p>A US Air Force pilot flying a Beechcraft 350 C reported a close encounter with a “football-sized” cylindrical unidentified flying object (UFO) during a secret flight in California on September 17, 2023. The incident occurred at approximately 2:30 p.m. as the pilot was operating the aircraft at an altitude of 20,000 feet, according to leaked audio of the communication with air traffic control obtained by NewsNation’s “Banfield.” No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This sighting has raised questions among experts and authorities regarding the nature of the object and its implications for air safety. The pilot, identified as “Troy 21,” mentioned that he was on a military-related flight involving the Department of Homeland Security, prompting further investigation into the incident.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Incident date: September 17, 2023</li>
    <li>Time of report: 2:30 p.m. PDT</li>
    <li>Aircraft type: Beechcraft 350 C</li>
    <li>Altitude: 20,000 feet</li>
    <li>Location: California, in controlled airspace</li>
    <li>Object description: Dark gray, cylindrical, approximately the size of a football</li>
    <li>Reported distance from aircraft: 10 feet under the right wing</li>
    <li>Air traffic controllers involved: Local air traffic control in Los Angeles</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>At around 2:30 p.m. on September 17, the pilot reported seeing a cylindrical object pass under his wing. He expressed uncertainty about whether it was a drone, despite the altitude being uncommon for such devices. The pilot stated that his sensor operator was attempting to locate the object on camera.</p>
<p>Approximately one minute later, he indicated that he saw an object on the jet’s air-to-air radar. About 40 seconds after that, another object was detected on radar 60 miles away, but it is unclear if it was the same object that passed under the aircraft.</p>
<p>Later in the recording, another air traffic controller mentioned a UFO sighting, noting that it had been “taken care of.” This controller subsequently reported the incident to the National UFO Reporting Center.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “This is going to sound weird, but I just had something pass underneath my wing. Maybe a football-sized object right under my wing,” said the pilot identified as “Troy 21.”
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “I’ve got my sensor operator looking for it on the camera right now, we’ll see if we can find it,” he added.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “There was a UFO reported here, but that’s all taken care of now,” said another air traffic controller.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident shares similarities with a previous sighting reported by former NASA astronaut Leroy Chiao, who described two cylindrical, metallic orbs passing under his wings while flying over Texas last summer. Chiao noted that the objects showed no visible means of propulsion and raised concerns about the presence of unidentified flying objects in controlled airspace.</p>
<p>The Pentagon has previously acknowledged the existence of unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), including a report of a small cylindrical object flying through controlled airspace in Iraq, which was made public in 2023.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities are investigating the sighting further, with reports filed with the National UFO Reporting Center. There are no disclosed timelines for the investigation or potential outcomes at this time.</p>
