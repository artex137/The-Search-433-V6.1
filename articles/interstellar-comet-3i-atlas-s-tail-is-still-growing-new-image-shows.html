      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS's tail is still growing, new image shows</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1 ATLAS) has shown a significant increase in its ion tail as it travels through the inner solar system, according to a new image captured by the Virtual Telescope Project in Manciano, Italy. The image was taken at 11:31 p.m. EDT on November 10 (0431 GMT on November 11) and reveals a longer and more structured ion tail, indicating heightened activity from the comet.</p>

<p>This development is important for astronomers as it provides a unique opportunity to study the behavior of an interstellar comet under the influence of solar radiation. The Virtual Telescope Project plans to continue monitoring 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the inner solar system, offering insights into its composition and the conditions of its origin.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Comet: 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1 ATLAS)</li>
<li>Date of image capture: November 10, 2023</li>
<li>Time of image capture: 11:31 p.m. EDT (0431 GMT November 11)</li>
<li>Location of observation: Manciano, Italy</li>
<li>Ion tail length: approximately 0.7 degrees across the sky</li>
<li>Previous detection: July 2023</li>
<li>Third confirmed interstellar object detected, following 1I/'Oumuamua (2017) and 2I/Borisov (2019)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected in July 2023. Since then, astronomers have been observing its trajectory and activity, noting changes in its tail and overall brightness.</p>
<p>The latest image, captured on November 10, shows a sharp ion tail and a compact coma, indicating that the comet is venting gas and dust more vigorously as it approaches the sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Exploiting the unusual good weather of this season, we imaged the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS again, recording a much more developed ion tail,” said Gianluca Masi, founder of the Virtual Telescope Project.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Looking at the picture, we see how the ion tail of 3I/ATLAS is clearly showing better and better,” Masi added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable as only the third confirmed interstellar object detected to date. Unlike its predecessors, this comet is bright enough for detailed study using ground-based telescopes. This allows scientists to gather information about the comet's composition and the conditions in the distant planetary system from which it originated.</p>
<p>The growing length and brightness of the ion tail suggest that the comet is releasing volatile materials, likely including carbon dioxide and dust, as it is heated by the sun.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The Virtual Telescope Project will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it journeys through the inner solar system, providing further images and data on its activity and composition.</p>
