      <h2>Stephen Hawking’s warnings about alien contact gain strength with the passage of comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>The passage of comet 3I/ATLAS through the Solar System has reignited discussions about the potential risks of contact with extraterrestrial civilizations. Discovered in July 2025 by the ATLAS telescope in Chile, the comet confirmed its interstellar origin due to its hyperbolic trajectory, making it the third confirmed interstellar visitor after ‘Oumuamua and Borisov. The comet’s unique chemical composition and behavior have prompted scientists to revisit warnings from physicist Stephen Hawking regarding the dangers of such encounters.</p>

<p>NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) have stated that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat of collision with Earth. The comet's closest approach occurred in December 2025, at a distance of 270 million kilometers. However, its journey through space raises questions about its nature and the implications of potential extraterrestrial contact, echoing Hawking's concerns about the risks of interacting with advanced alien cultures.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Comet 3I/ATLAS passed through the Solar System in December 2025 at a distance of 270 million kilometers from Earth.</li>
<li>Discovered in July 2025 by the ATLAS telescope in Chile.</li>
<li>Comet reached perihelion on October 30, 2025, at 210 million kilometers from the Sun.</li>
<li>Estimated speed of 60 km/s during its journey.</li>
<li>Age of the comet is estimated to be between 7.6 and 14 billion years.</li>
<li>NASA and ESA confirmed the comet poses no risk to Earth or Mars.</li>
<li>Ongoing observations are being conducted by missions such as Mars Express and the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025 by the ATLAS telescope in Chile. It reached its closest point to the Sun, known as perihelion, on October 30, 2025, at a distance of 210 million kilometers. The comet made its closest approach to Earth in December 2025, maintaining a safe distance of 270 million kilometers.</p>
<p>Throughout this period, NASA and ESA have conducted observations to gather data on the comet’s composition and behavior. Notably, the James Webb Space Telescope identified complex organic compounds in the comet’s coma, contributing to the scientific interest surrounding this interstellar object.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS poses no risk of collision with Earth. Its orbit has kept it at a safe distance throughout its passage,” said a NASA spokesperson.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The comet’s stable activity and unique chemical signature provide valuable insights into the formation of planetary systems,” stated an ESA representative.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discussion surrounding 3I/ATLAS has been intensified by the involvement of physicist Avi Loeb, who has suggested that certain anomalies in the comet’s behavior could indicate an artificial origin. His claims, while not widely accepted in the scientific community, have sparked debate about the nature of interstellar objects and the potential for extraterrestrial technology.</p>
<p>Stephen Hawking previously warned that contact with an advanced civilization could be dangerous, as their interests may not align with humanity's survival. He opposed efforts to send active messages into space, fearing that it could attract hostile entities.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and ESA will continue monitoring comet 3I/ATLAS until early 2026. Data collected will help scientists refine models of how interstellar objects behave and contribute to our understanding of distant planetary systems.</p>
