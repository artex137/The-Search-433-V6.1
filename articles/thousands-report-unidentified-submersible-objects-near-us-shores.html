      <h2>Thousands Report Unidentified Submersible Objects Near US Shores</h2>

<p>Thousands of sightings of Unidentified Submersible Objects (USOs) have been reported near U.S. coastlines since late 2022, with over 9,000 incidents documented by the Enigma app. California and Florida have emerged as hotspots for these sightings, with 389 and 306 reports respectively, as of August 2025.</p>

<p>This surge in reports has captured the attention of public and national security officials alike. The phenomenon, which includes glowing orbs and mysterious underwater lights, has prompted calls for serious government investigation, particularly given the U.S. military's acknowledgment of USOs, including an incident involving the USS Omaha in 2019.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Enigma app recorded over 9,000 USO sightings since late 2022.</li>
    <li>California: 389 sightings; Florida: 306 sightings.</li>
    <li>500 sightings occurred within 5 miles of the U.S. coast.</li>
    <li>USS Omaha incident documented in July 2019.</li>
    <li>Retired Navy Rear Admiral Tim Gallaudet has called for serious investigation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Reports of USOs have been increasing steadily since late 2022, coinciding with the launch of the Enigma app. The app has since become the largest database for unexplained aerial and submersible phenomena. In July 2019, the USS Omaha tracked a spherical object that vanished into the ocean, an incident later confirmed by Pentagon officials. By August 2025, sightings have surged, prompting discussions among military officials and lawmakers.</p>

<blockquote>“The fact that unidentified objects with unexplainable characteristics are entering US water space…is a sign that the government is not sharing all it knows about all-domain anomalous phenomena,” said Gallaudet in a March 2024 report.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Historical records suggest that USOs are not a new phenomenon, with accounts dating back centuries. Reports from medieval sailors and early naturalists describe luminous objects rising from or plunging into the sea. This historical context adds depth to the current wave of sightings and public interest in the topic.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the USO sightings are expected to continue as officials seek to understand the phenomenon better. The U.S. government has yet to disclose its full knowledge regarding these incidents, leaving many questions unanswered.</p>
