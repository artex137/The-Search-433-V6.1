      <h2>3I/ATLAS Lights Up Mars Sky As NASA Unlocks Clues to Its Origins</h2>

<p>NASA has unveiled images of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS taken during its close flyby of Mars in October 2023, marking a rare astronomical event. The comet passed within 30 million kilometres of the Red Planet, allowing multiple missions to capture unprecedented views.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it provides insights into the origins of the comet and the conditions of its formation. NASA has restored operations following a government shutdown, enabling scientists to analyze optical, ultraviolet, and surface-based observations of the comet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS passed within 30 million kilometres of Mars on 2 October 2023.</li>
    <li>NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO), MAVEN spacecraft, and Perseverance rover captured images of the comet.</li>
    <li>MRO's HiRISE camera produced images showing a glowing white smudge about 1,500 kilometres across.</li>
    <li>MAVEN observed the comet from 27 September to 7 October, revealing chemical details of the coma.</li>
    <li>Perseverance rover captured images of the comet on 4 October 2023.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will make its closest approach to Earth on 19 December 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 27 September 2023, the MAVEN spacecraft began observing 3I/ATLAS, producing detailed ultraviolet images until 7 October. The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter captured images of the comet on 2 October. The Perseverance rover took its first images on 4 October, marking the first time an interstellar object has been imaged from the Martian surface. The release of NASA's images follows a government shutdown that delayed access to the data.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Interstellar objects are still rare enough that we learn something new on every occasion. We're fortunate that 3I/ATLAS passed this close to Mars,” said Shane Byrne, principal investigator for HiRISE at the University of Arizona.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Shannon Curry, MAVEN's principal investigator at the University of Colorado Boulder, described the detections as “significant” and noted that analysis had only begun to scratch the surface of what the data might reveal.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object ever observed in our Solar System. Its close approach to Mars has provided a unique opportunity for NASA and other space agencies to study its characteristics and learn more about its origin, particularly in relation to conditions in distant star systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and its partners will continue to analyze the data collected from the comet as it approaches Earth in December 2025. This ongoing research aims to unlock further secrets about the formation and evolution of interstellar objects.</p>
