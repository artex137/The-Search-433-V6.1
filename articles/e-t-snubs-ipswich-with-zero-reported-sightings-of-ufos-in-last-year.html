      <h2>E.T. snubs Ipswich with ZERO reported sightings of UFOs in last year</h2>

<p>Suffolk police have reported no sightings of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) or unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) in Ipswich over the past year, according to data obtained through a Freedom of Information request. This lack of reports spans from December 2024 to November 2025.</p>

<p>The absence of UFO sightings is significant, particularly given Suffolk's historical reputation as a site for alien activity. Authorities have confirmed that there were no calls related to UFO sightings, disappointing ufologists who investigate such phenomena. A Suffolk police spokesman stated, "There were no calls located that related to sightings of UFOs and UAPs."</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>No reported UFO sightings in Ipswich from December 2024 to November 2025.</li>
    <li>Data obtained through a Freedom of Information request to Suffolk police.</li>
    <li>The most famous UFO sighting in the UK occurred in Rendlesham Forest in December 1980.</li>
    <li>Rendlesham Forest is approximately 15 kilometers east of Ipswich.</li>
    <li>The Rendlesham incident involved USAF personnel, including Lieutenant Colonel Charles I. Halt.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In December 1980, a series of unexplained lights were reported in Rendlesham Forest, close to RAF Woodbridge, which was then used by the US Air Force. This incident has been dubbed "Britain's Roswell" due to its notoriety and the involvement of military personnel.</p>
<p>Since that time, Suffolk has been considered a hotspot for UFO sightings, although recent data indicates a stark decline in reported incidents.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "There were no calls located that related to sightings of UFOs and UAPs." 
    — Suffolk police spokesman
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Rendlesham Forest incident remains one of the most famous UFO sightings in the UK, often compared to the Roswell incident in New Mexico. Despite this history, the recent lack of reported sightings suggests a significant change in public engagement with UFO phenomena in Ipswich.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>No ongoing investigations or future reports of UFO sightings have been disclosed by Suffolk police. The situation will continue to be monitored by local authorities and ufologists alike.</p>
