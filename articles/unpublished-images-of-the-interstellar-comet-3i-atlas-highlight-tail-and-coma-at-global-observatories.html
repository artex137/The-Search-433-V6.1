      <h2>Unpublished images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS highlight tail and coma at global observatories</h2>

<p>Astronomers from several countries have released new images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, showcasing its bright coma and extensive tail. The images were obtained through a coordinated effort involving ground-based and space observatories and were made public on January 3, 2026.</p>

<p>This release is significant as it enhances understanding of the comet's characteristics and its origins in the Milky Way. Authorities involved in the observation campaign have emphasized the importance of international collaboration in astronomical research.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet passed through perihelion in October 2025.</li>
    <li>It has an excess speed of approximately 58 km/s relative to the Sun.</li>
    <li>Current observations indicate a magnitude of +15.6, requiring specialized imaging equipment.</li>
    <li>The observation campaign involved telescopes in Hawaii, Chile, Spain, and the Canary Islands.</li>
    <li>Recent measurements have detected significant water production from the comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected in July 2025 by the ATLAS system in Chile. It reached perihelion in October 2025, safely approaching the Sun. As of January 2026, the comet remains visible to professional telescopes, although its brightness has decreased.</p>
<p>The coordinated observation campaign involved multiple telescopes capturing the comet from different angles, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of its structure and activity.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The recent images reveal jets of material and an asymmetric structure in the core, indicating active processes within the comet,” said a representative from one of the participating observatories.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object, following 1I/’Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Unlike 1I/’Oumuamua, which displayed no signs of activity, 3I/ATLAS shows a diffuse coma and tail, suggesting a more complex composition and behavior.</p>
<p>The observations of 3I/ATLAS provide a rare opportunity to study materials formed around another star, potentially billions of years ago, and compare them to local comets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it moves away from the Sun, gathering data for long-term studies of interstellar objects. The accumulated data will aid in understanding the nature of wandering objects in the galaxy.</p>
