      <h2>Avi Loeb Flags 'Concerning' 3I/ATLAS Anomalies, Urges NASA to Release Data</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist Dr. Avi Loeb has raised concerns about anomalies observed in the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, urging NASA to release relevant data. Dr. Loeb made his comments following the comet's perihelion passage on Wednesday and Thursday, during which he noted unusual brightening and a shift to blue wavelengths.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as it could contribute to the scientific understanding of interstellar comets. Dr. Loeb has contacted U.S. Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna, who has agreed to reach out to NASA for more information. Dr. Loeb emphasized the importance of sharing data for scientific practice, asserting that withholding information hampers research efforts.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar comet to be studied.</li>
    <li>The comet was discovered on 1 July 2023 by the NASA-funded ATLAS survey telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile.</li>
    <li>NASA has confirmed that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth, maintaining a distance of 240 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>The comet will move away from the solar system by early December 2023.</li>
    <li>It is expected to be faintly visible again to telescopes in the Northern Hemisphere on 19 December 2023.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 1 July 2023, 3I/ATLAS was discovered by the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile. The comet passed its closest point to the Sun on Wednesday and Thursday, prompting Dr. Loeb's observations of its anomalous brightening. He reported that instruments observing the Sun detected the comet's brightness exceeding expectations.</p>

<p>Following the perihelion, Dr. Loeb expressed his concerns about the data gap and contacted Congresswoman Luna for assistance in obtaining information from NASA.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The principal investigator is at the University of Arizona is not a NASA employee and moreover, it's time to share the data with the scientific community even if they don't want to make a press release,” said Dr. Loeb.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The politics of the day should not sabotage science. They have the data. They should share it with scientists,” he added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is significant not only for its status as the third interstellar comet discovered but also for the insights it may provide into comets from other solar systems. Astronomy and astrophysics professor Jason Wright noted the excitement within the scientific community regarding the potential findings from such comets.</p>

<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS follows a trend of increased interest in interstellar objects, with scientists eager to learn from these rare occurrences.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Congresswoman Luna plans to contact NASA for further information on 3I/ATLAS. Meanwhile, Dr. Loeb continues to advocate for the release of data to facilitate ongoing research and observations.</p>
