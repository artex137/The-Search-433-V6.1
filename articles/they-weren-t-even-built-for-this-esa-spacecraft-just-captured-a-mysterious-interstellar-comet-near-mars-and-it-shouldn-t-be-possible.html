      <h2>ESA Spacecraft Captures Interstellar Comet Near Mars</h2>
<p>On October 11, 2025, the European Space Agency (ESA) spacecraft has captured images of the interstellar comet known as 3I/ATLAS near Mars. This discovery has raised questions among scientists, as such an observation was not expected to be possible.</p>

<p>This event is significant for the scientific community, as it challenges current understanding of comet behaviour and interstellar objects. ESA officials have expressed excitement about the findings, stating they will further analyze the data to gain insights into the composition and origin of the comet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of discovery: October 11, 2025</li>
    <li>Object: Comet 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Location: Near Mars</li>
    <li>Agency involved: European Space Agency (ESA)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 11, 2025, ESA's spacecraft detected the comet, which is the first of its kind to be observed in this region. The data collected is currently under review by scientists to determine the implications of this discovery.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“They weren’t even built for this,” an ESA scientist remarked about the spacecraft's capabilities in capturing the comet’s images.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to this event, interstellar comets have been observed, but capturing one near Mars was not anticipated. The scientific community has been monitoring such objects to understand their origins and characteristics.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>ESA officials plan to conduct further analysis of the data collected from the spacecraft to understand the nature of 3I/ATLAS and its potential implications for future space exploration.</p>
