      <h2>3I/ATLAS: The Virtual Telescope Project Releases Fresh Images Of Fragmented Interstellar Comet Ahead Of Livestream</h2>

<p>The Tuscany-based Virtual Telescope Project 2.0 has released new images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, captured during a brief window of clear sky on an unspecified date. The project previously faced several days of bad weather, including rain and clouds, before managing to take photos of the comet, which was discovered on July 1, 2025.</p>

<p>This release is significant as it showcases the comet's fragmentation, which has intrigued scientists since its discovery. The Virtual Telescope Project has stated that a live telecast of the comet is planned for viewers worldwide, although it has been postponed due to weather issues.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Images captured from Manciano, Italy.</li>
    <li>Photos taken during a 10-minute clear window.</li>
    <li>Seven 60-second unfiltered exposures were used to create the images.</li>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS shows at least three fragments of its original nucleus.</li>
    <li>The live event has been postponed to October 25, 2023.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The Virtual Telescope Project released images of comet 3I/ATLAS after successfully capturing photos during a brief clear period. The comet was first discovered on July 1, 2025, and has been the subject of various studies and observations since then.</p>
<p>Following the release of these images, the project announced a live telecast scheduled for October 25, 2023, to share further insights about the comet with the public.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We had just the time to capture that handful of frames before clouds covered the whole sky,” said a representative from the Virtual Telescope Project. “We had less than 10 minutes of clear sky to capture new images of comet C/2025 K1 ATLAS, clearly detecting three fragments of the original nucleus and possibly a fourth one.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar visitor to enter the solar system, following previous discoveries that have sparked significant interest in astrobiology and planetary science. The ongoing research aims to understand the origins and characteristics of such celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The Virtual Telescope Project will focus on rescheduling the live telecast for October 25, 2023, to further share findings related to comet 3I/ATLAS with the global audience.</p>
