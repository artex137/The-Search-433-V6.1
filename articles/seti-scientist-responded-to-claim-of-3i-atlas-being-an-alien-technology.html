      <h2>SETI scientist responds to claim of 3I/ATLAS being an alien technology</h2>

<p>A new study has prompted a response from a scientist at the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) Institute regarding the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS. The comet, discovered in July 2025 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS), has been the subject of speculation about its potential extraterrestrial nature.</p>

<p>This response matters as it addresses ongoing discussions within the scientific community about the implications of 3I/ATLAS. The study, coauthored by Harvard astrophysicist Abraham Loeb, suggested that the comet could be an alien probe. However, SETI scientist A.K.M. Eahsanul Haque has countered this claim, emphasizing that there is no evidence to support the idea of alien technology associated with the comet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS discovered in July 2025</li>
    <li>Study coauthored by Abraham Loeb from Harvard University</li>
    <li>SETI scientist A.K.M. Eahsanul Haque published a response on Earth ArXiv</li>
    <li>Comet set to become invisible until late November/early December 2025</li>
    <li>ATLAS designed to detect extraterrestrial threats</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025 by the ATLAS telescope, which is specifically designed to identify threats to Earth from space. The comet's unusual characteristics led to a study exploring its possible extraterrestrial origins.</p>

<p>In a subsequent paper published on Earth ArXiv, Haque challenged the claims made by Loeb and his coauthors, arguing against the notion that the comet's orbital characteristics imply it is an alien technology.</p>

<p>The comet is expected to become invisible due to the Sun's glare from late November to early December 2025, limiting observations during this period.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>A.K.M. Eahsanul Haque stated, "The galactic disk, which is where most stars are, is nearly in line with the solar system's ecliptic plane." He expressed confidence that the trajectory of 3I/ATLAS is what would be expected from an interstellar comet expelled by another star.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Abraham Loeb has described the theory surrounding 3I/ATLAS as a "pedagogical exercise" and a "fun to explore," while urging authorities to remain prepared with planetary defenses.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discussions surrounding 3I/ATLAS highlight a broader trend in the scientific community regarding the search for extraterrestrial life and the interpretation of unusual celestial phenomena. The "Dark Forest" hypothesis, referenced in the earlier study, raises concerns about the potential for hostile actions by advanced civilizations.</p>

<p>Previous claims about extraterrestrial technology have sparked debate among scientists, with varying opinions on the validity of such theories.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Moving forward, scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches perihelion in late 2025. Observations during this time will be limited due to the Sun's glare, but researchers will analyze any data collected before and after this period.</p>
