      <h2>Relics of an abandoned future — the tangled story of Taiwan’s eerie UFO village</h2>

<p>On 17 February 2026, Wanli UFO Village, located on Taiwan’s northern coast, stands as a ghostly reminder of a future that never materialized. The village, featuring abandoned UFO-shaped homes, has remained deserted since 1980. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with the site.</p>

<p>This village matters as it symbolizes a unique intersection of Cold War geopolitics, economic aspirations, and retro-futuristic dreams. Authorities have not disclosed any current plans for the site, but it continues to draw attention as a cultural and historical curiosity.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Location: Wanli UFO Village, Taiwan</li>
    <li>Established: 1980</li>
    <li>Architect: Matti Suuronen</li>
    <li>Number of functional Futuros worldwide: fewer than 100</li>
    <li>Current status: Abandoned</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The origins of Wanli UFO Village trace back to the late 1960s when Finnish architect Matti Suuronen conceived the UFO-shaped homes as mobile, lightweight ski chalets. The designs were intended to address global housing challenges.</p>

<p>However, production ceased in 1973 due to economic volatility from the oil crisis, leaving fewer than 100 Futuros ever constructed. By 1980, Wanli UFO Village had been established, but it quickly fell into disrepair and has remained uninhabited.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The story of this forgotten UFO village is stranger than science fiction,” said Ruby Dalmer, who explored the village's history.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Wanli UFO Village is a product of Taiwan's complex history, particularly during the Cold War. After the Kuomintang (KMT) took control of Taiwan in 1949, the island struggled with its identity amidst rising tensions with the People’s Republic of China. The United States' military presence in Taiwan during the Cold War further influenced local culture and economy.</p>

<p>During this period, Taiwan experienced rapid economic growth, becoming one of the "Four Asian Tigers." However, the authoritarian regime of the KMT restricted travel, which led to increased domestic tourism and the rise of unique attractions like Wanli UFO Village.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities have not disclosed any specific plans for the future of Wanli UFO Village. Ongoing interest from tourists and historians may prompt discussions about preservation or redevelopment, but no formal investigations or initiatives are currently in progress.</p>
