      <h2>NASA's Latest 3I/ATLAS Images Show a Strange Feature of the Comet</h2>

<p>NASA has released high-resolution images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, captured by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter during its close approach to Mars in October 2023. The images, released on 19 November, have sparked scientific debate, particularly regarding anomalous plume trajectories identified by Harvard physicist Avi Loeb, who suggests they may indicate extraterrestrial technology, a claim NASA has rejected.</p>

<p>The release of these images matters because they provide the closest look yet at 3I/ATLAS, which is believed to have originated from outside the Solar System. NASA is actively investigating the comet using multiple instruments, aiming to understand its composition and origins better.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Images released on 19 November 2023</li>
    <li>Captured during the comet's close approach to Mars in early October</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is moving three times faster than the average speed of comets</li>
    <li>NASA is observing the comet through 12 different instruments</li>
    <li>Loeb claims plume trajectories point to potential extraterrestrial technology</li>
    <li>Nasa Associate Administrator Amit Kshatriya has refuted these claims</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In early October 2023, NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter captured images of 3I/ATLAS as it passed by Mars. On 19 November, the agency released the highest-resolution images yet of the comet, stirring interest in its unusual features.</p>

<p>Harvard physicist Avi Loeb has since highlighted irregularities in the comet's emissions, specifically the direction of its jets, which he argues differ from typical comet behavior. In response, NASA officials, including Associate Administrator Amit Kshatriya, have emphasized that 3I/ATLAS is a comet, dismissing the idea of it being an alien spacecraft.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "This object is a comet. It looks and behaves like a comet, and all evidence points towards it being a comet." 
    — Amit Kshatriya, NASA Associate Administrator
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    "Which gives me goosebumps to think about frankly, because that means that 3I/ATLAS is not just a window into another solar system; it's a window into the deep past." 
    — Tom Statler, NASA Planetary Science Division
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable for being the first known interstellar comet, having originated from outside the Solar System. Researchers believe it may be billions of years old, possibly older than the Sun. Its unique speed and trajectory have led to various hypotheses regarding its origin and composition.</p>

<p>Previous studies of comets have focused on their behavior within the Solar System, making 3I/ATLAS a significant subject for understanding interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA continues to observe 3I/ATLAS using multiple instruments to gather more data on its composition and trajectory. The agency will release further findings as the investigation progresses.</p>
