      <h2>Unidentified Flying Objects Reported Over Essex in the Past Decade</h2>
<p>Essex Police have recorded multiple reports of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) over the past decade, with sightings documented in accordance with National Standards of Incident Recording. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with these incidents.</p>

<p>Authorities have stated that while some reports may indicate potential aircraft in distress or illegal aircraft activity, many sightings reflect aerial phenomena that lack clear explanations. A spokesperson for Essex Police noted, "Although the purpose of the UFO incident type is to identify specific policing needs with regards to aircraft, some of these records may reflect sightings of alleged aerial phenomenon that elude obvious explanation."</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Reports span from 2015 to 2024.</li>
    <li>Locations include Braintree, Tendring, Colchester, and Clacton.</li>
    <li>Notable sightings include bright lights, unusual formations, and noise complaints.</li>
    <li>Essex Police classified these reports under non-policing matters.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2015, multiple reports emerged from Braintree and Tendring, including a bright orange light and a drone-like object with flashing lights. In 2020, Colchester residents reported three strange objects and 30 balls of light moving swiftly across the sky.</p>
<p>By 2021, witnesses noted 27 lights in a straight line with no audible sounds. The following year, reports included a stationary red light in Clacton. Most recently, in 2023, a metallic oval-shaped object was reported in Colchester, while a flare-like object was sighted in 2024.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The report of an alleged UFO has the potential to be an aircraft in distress or an instance of illegal aircraft activity,” said a spokesperson for Essex Police.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“She is concerned the police are going to think that she has gone mad but she has just seen another one go overhead,” read a statement from a Tendring resident.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>UFO sightings have been a topic of interest in various regions, with authorities often tasked with distinguishing between genuine threats and misidentified objects. The trend of reported sightings in Essex reflects a broader phenomenon of increasing public interest in aerial phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Essex Police will continue to document sightings in accordance with their policies, but no further investigations are expected unless reports indicate potential threats to public safety.</p>
