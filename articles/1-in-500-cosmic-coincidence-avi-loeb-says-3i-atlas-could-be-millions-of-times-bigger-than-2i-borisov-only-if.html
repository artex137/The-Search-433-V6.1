      <h2>1-in-500 cosmic coincidence? Avi Loeb says 3I/ATLAS could be millions of times bigger than 2I/Borisov, only if...</h2>

<p>NASA has reported the observation of a carbon dioxide cloud around interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, which is currently moving towards the inner solar system. The observations were made by NASA's SPHEREx space observatory between August 8 and August 12, 2023. Harvard scientist Avi Loeb has claimed that the absence of a water cloud indicates that 3I/ATLAS is unlikely to be a natural space rock.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it raises questions about the nature of 3I/ATLAS. Loeb has suggested that the object may not be a comet but rather an artificial construct sent by extraterrestrial beings. Authorities continue to analyze data from SPHEREx and other observatories to determine the object's characteristics and origins.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Observation dates: August 8–12, 2023</li>
    <li>Observatory: NASA's SPHEREx</li>
    <li>Claimed mass loss rate: 70 kilograms per second</li>
    <li>Diameter of 3I/ATLAS: 46 kilometres</li>
    <li>Comparison: 1 million times larger than interstellar comet 2I/Borisov</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>NASA's SPHEREx space observatory conducted observations of 3I/ATLAS from August 8 to August 12, 2023. During this time, a cloud of carbon dioxide was detected around the object, while no water cloud was observed. Loeb has stated that the absence of a water gas coma is puzzling given the object's proximity to the solar system's water ice line.</p>
<p>In a subsequent blog post, Loeb detailed his theories regarding the object's nature and trajectory, suggesting a purposeful design by an intelligent civilization.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "The reflected spectrum from the surface of 3I/ATLAS shows a mix of water and carbon dioxide ices combined with organics." He added, "The chances of such a random orientation happening are only one in 500."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the second known interstellar object to enter the solar system, following 2I/Borisov, which was detected in 2019. Loeb's theories about extraterrestrial life and artificial objects in space have drawn both interest and skepticism from the scientific community. His assertions about 3I/ATLAS challenge traditional views on the formation and behavior of comets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and other astronomical agencies will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS and analyze data from various observatories. Further studies may provide clarity on the nature of the object and its implications for our understanding of interstellar phenomena.</p>
