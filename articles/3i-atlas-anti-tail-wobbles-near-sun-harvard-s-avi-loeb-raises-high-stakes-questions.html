      <h2>3I/ATLAS Anti-Tail Wobbles Near Sun, Harvard's Avi Loeb Raises High-Stakes Questions</h2>

<p>An unexpected wobble has been observed in the 'anti-tail' of interstellar object 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun, prompting a call for investigation from Harvard University astrophysicist Professor Avi Loeb. The phenomenon was detected on 29 October 2025, during the comet's perihelion, raising significant questions about our understanding of cometary physics.</p>

<p>This observation matters because it challenges existing models of comet behaviour and has sparked intense scientific debate. According to Loeb, the anti-tail's change in orientation cannot be explained by conventional cometary physics alone. He emphasizes the need for rigorous analysis to understand the implications of this anomaly.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> 1 July 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Perihelion Date:</strong> 29 October 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to Earth:</strong> 19 December 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Key Figure:</strong> Professor Avi Loeb, Harvard University</li>
    <li><strong>Structure Observed:</strong> Anti-tail of 3I/ATLAS</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first discovered on 1 July 2025. As the comet approached its perihelion on 29 October 2025, astronomers expected typical cometary behaviour. Instead, they observed an unusual 'anti-tail' directed towards the Sun, which later exhibited a change in orientation.</p>
<p>The wobble has led to a debate among scientists about the nature of the structure, with some supporting Loeb's hypothesis of complex physical processes at play, while others argue it can be explained by established cometary physics.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The anti-tail's persistence and its wobble suggest a complexity beyond common models,” said Professor Avi Loeb. “We need to keep an open mind regarding these anomalies.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar visitor, following 1I/'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Each of these objects displayed unique features that have challenged traditional cometary science. Loeb's previous work regarding 'Oumuamua has positioned him as a proponent of alternative explanations for astronomical anomalies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>A coordinated suite of observations is planned as 3I/ATLAS nears its closest approach to Earth on 19 December 2025. Ground-based telescopes, space observatories, and ESA's JUICE spacecraft will aim to capture data on the object's activity, composition, and tail morphology.</p>
