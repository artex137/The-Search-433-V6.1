      <h2>Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS: NASA Data Reveals The Truth About Its Friday Fly-By</h2>

<p>NASA has confirmed that the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS will reach its closest approach to Earth on Friday, December 19, 2025, at approximately 1.8 astronomical units away, which is about 270 million kilometres. The comet, which is only the third confirmed interstellar object to enter our solar system, was discovered by a Chile-based telescope that is part of a NASA-funded network designed for early warnings of Earth-bound asteroids.</p>

<p>This event is significant for astronomers and the public alike due to the rarity of interstellar objects passing through our solar system. Observers have been tracking 3I/ATLAS since autumn as it travels through the constellation of Virgo, but it remains invisible to the naked eye and is challenging to capture with amateur telescopes.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Event:</strong> Closest approach of comet 3I/ATLAS</li>
  <li><strong>Date:</strong> December 19, 2025</li>
  <li><strong>Distance:</strong> Approximately 1.8 AU (270 million km or 170 million miles)</li>
  <li><strong>Location:</strong> Constellation of Virgo</li>
  <li><strong>Discovery:</strong> Chile-based telescope, part of NASA-funded network</li>
  <li><strong>Previous interstellar objects:</strong> 1I 'Oumuamua (2017), 2I Borisov (2019)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Since its discovery, 3I/ATLAS has been monitored by astronomers. The comet was first observed in autumn 2025, and its trajectory has been tracked as it approached our solar system.</p>
<p>On December 19, 2025, the comet will reach its closest point to Earth, triggering heightened public interest and discussions on social media.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Despite the inevitable demands for high-resolution, 'face-to-face' photos of the rock, NASA and other space agencies simply do not have the technology to take crisp portraits of an asphalt-dark object only a few miles wide at such a distance,” said a NASA spokesperson.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The arrival of 3I/ATLAS follows the notable interstellar objects 1I 'Oumuamua and 2I Borisov, which were observed in 2017 and 2019, respectively. The rarity of these encounters has captured the attention of both scientists and the public, leading to various theories and discussions, including unfounded claims of extraterrestrial origins.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS makes its closest approach, astronomers will take advantage of the opportunity to gather data before the comet continues its journey into interstellar space, never to return.</p>
