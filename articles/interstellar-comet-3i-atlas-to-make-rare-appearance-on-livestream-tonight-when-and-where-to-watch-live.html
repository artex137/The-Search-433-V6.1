      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS To Make Rare Appearance On Livestream Tonight</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS will be visible in a livestream hosted by The Virtual Telescope Project tonight at 11:15 pm ET. The comet, only the third known interstellar object to enter our solar system, has intrigued astronomers and sky-watchers since its discovery four months ago. There are no reported injuries or fatalities associated with the comet's appearance.</p>

<p>The livestream provides a unique opportunity for global viewers to observe the comet as it moves farther from the Sun. NASA is set to release high-resolution images of 3I/ATLAS next week, which are expected to clarify ongoing debates about its nature and trajectory.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Event:</strong> Livestream of comet 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Date:</strong> Tonight, 11:15 pm ET</li>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> Visible above the eastern horizon, constellation Virgo</li>
    <li><strong>Magnitude:</strong> +10.9 (too faint for naked eye)</li>
    <li><strong>Telescopes:</strong> High-powered telescopes in Manciano, Italy</li>
    <li><strong>Image Release:</strong> Expected next week from NASA</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered four months ago and has since drawn significant attention due to its unusual trajectory, which included close passes by Jupiter, Venus, and Mars. The comet's perihelion occurred last month. The Virtual Telescope Project has scheduled the livestream for tonight, allowing viewers to catch a glimpse of the comet in real-time.</p>

<p>NASA's high-resolution images of 3I/ATLAS are anticipated to be released as early as next week, following delays caused by a recent government shutdown.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Delaying scientific data due to bureaucracy is unnecessary,” said Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb. “The truth of 3I/ATLAS will emerge only through open data-sharing rather than speculation.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The appearance of 3I/ATLAS marks a significant event in the study of interstellar objects. The comet has sparked discussions about its origin and nature, with some speculating it could be an extraterrestrial spacecraft. This follows a trend of increased public interest in astronomical phenomena, fueled by influential figures in the tech industry.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following the livestream, viewers can expect the release of NASA's high-resolution images next week, which may provide further insights into the characteristics of 3I/ATLAS.</p>
