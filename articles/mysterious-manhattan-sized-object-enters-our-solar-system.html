      <h2>Mysterious Manhattan-sized object enters our solar system</h2>

<p>A mysterious object the size of Manhattan, designated 3I/Atlas, has been spotted by astronomers as it travels through our Solar System. The object, which is believed to originate from outside our Solar System, is currently moving at a speed exceeding 60 kilometres per second. It poses no threat to Earth and is located approximately 4.5 astronomical units (AU) from the Sun, or about 416 million miles (670 million kilometres).</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as 3I/Atlas is only the third known interstellar object detected, following 'Oumuamua in 2017 and comet 2I/Borisov in 2019. Authorities, including the NASA-funded ATLAS survey team, are actively studying the comet, which is expected to make its closest approach to the Sun on 29 October, providing a valuable opportunity for observation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object Name:</strong> 3I/Atlas (previously A11pl3Z)</li>
    <li><strong>Size:</strong> Estimated between 10 and 20 kilometres wide</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Over 60 kilometres per second</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Sun:</strong> Approximately 4.5 AU (416 million miles)</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to the Sun:</strong> 29 October 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery:</strong> Made by a Chile-based observatory in mid-June 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/Atlas was first made by a Chile-based observatory participating in the NASA-funded ATLAS survey in mid-June 2025. Since then, both professional and amateur astronomers have been racing to capture images and analyze the object before it exits the Solar System.</p>
<p>Astrafoxen, an astrophysics undergraduate student in California, has successfully captured remarkable images of the object using the Deep Random Survey telescope. This telescope is a collaboration of amateur astronomers from various countries, including the United States, Germany, and India.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Astrafoxen stated, “I was one of the people remotely operating the Deep Random Survey telescope.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The detection of 3I/Atlas marks a significant moment in astronomy, as it is only the third interstellar object ever observed. The previous discoveries, 'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have provided valuable insights into the composition of materials from other star systems, and scientists hope 3I/Atlas will do the same.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/Atlas as it approaches its perihelion on 29 October 2025, aiming to gather as much data as possible before it moves back into interstellar space.</p>
