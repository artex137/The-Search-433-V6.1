      <h2>Interstellar comet is making closest approach this week. What to know</h2>

<p>3I/Atlas, an interstellar comet, will reach its closest point to Earth on December 19, 2025, coming within approximately 170 million miles of the planet, according to Space.com. There are no reported injuries or fatalities associated with the comet’s approach.</p>

<p>This event is significant as 3I/Atlas is only the third interstellar object discovered in our solar system. Scientists first identified the comet in July 2025. Authorities are monitoring its trajectory as it approaches the sun and Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas will be closest to Earth on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>It will come within about 170 million miles of Earth.</li>
    <li>The comet was discovered in July 2025.</li>
    <li>It is the third interstellar object identified in our solar system.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, astronomers discovered the interstellar comet 3I/Atlas. Since its discovery, scientists have studied its path and characteristics as it approaches the solar system. On December 19, 2025, the comet will reach its closest point to Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/Atlas has captured the attention of astronomers worldwide, raising questions about its origins and composition,” said a representative from Space.com.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/Atlas adds to the growing list of interstellar objects identified in our solar system. Previous notable interstellar objects include 'Oumuamua and Comet 2I/Borisov, both of which sparked interest and research into the nature of such celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to observe 3I/Atlas as it approaches Earth, gathering data to better understand its properties and origins.</p>
