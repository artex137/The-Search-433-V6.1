      <h2>'The E.T. of Varginha': 30-Year Mystery of 'Alien' Sightings</h2>

<p>On January 20, 1996, three girls in Varginha, Brazil, claimed to have encountered an alien-like creature, sparking a mystery that continues to intrigue many. The girls described the being as having a heart-shaped face, large red eyes, three horns, and a shiny brown body, crouched beside a wall in a vacant lot. They reported the sighting to their mother, who said they thought they had seen the devil. The incident has gained renewed attention following recent testimonies, including that of a doctor who asserts he saw a non-human creature in his hospital.</p>

<p>The significance of this case has led to ongoing investigations by various authorities. The Brazilian Army conducted an official investigation shortly after the sighting, questioning witnesses and examining military logs. However, the official report dismissed the claims, attributing the sightings to misinterpretations during a violent summer storm. New testimonies presented recently have challenged this conclusion, reigniting public interest in the events that unfolded over three decades ago.</p>

<p>The Brazilian Army launched an investigation, interviewing military personnel and examining vehicle logs. The investigation concluded with a report that labeled the claims as false. In recent years, new testimonies have emerged, notably from Italo Venturelli, who claims he saw a non-human being in a local hospital.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>

<p>Recent developments, including the press conference organized by filmmaker James Fox, have brought new attention to the incident, highlighting ongoing public interest and the desire for further investigation.</p>
