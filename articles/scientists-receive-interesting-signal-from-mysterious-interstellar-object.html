      <h2>Scientists Receive Interesting Signal From Mysterious Interstellar Object</h2>

<p>Astronomers have detected intriguing radio signals from the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS as it reemerged from behind the Sun last week. The signals provide new insights into its chemical composition. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this discovery.</p>

<p>This finding is significant as it may support the theory that 3I/ATLAS is a comet shedding water as it approaches the Sun. Researchers are now analyzing the signals to learn more about the object’s characteristics and origins.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS reached its perihelion on October 29.</li>
    <li>It was at solar conjunction with Earth on October 24.</li>
    <li>Astronomers used the MeerKAT radio telescope at the South African Radio Astronomy Observatory.</li>
    <li>Previous attempts to detect signals from 3I/ATLAS in September were unsuccessful.</li>
    <li>Hydroxyl radicals were detected, indicating water molecules are present.</li>
    <li>The object is expected to pass within 53 million kilometers from Jupiter on March 16, 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 24, astronomers at the South African Radio Astronomy Observatory successfully detected radio signals from 3I/ATLAS using the MeerKAT radio telescope. This marked the first radio detection of the object, following two unsuccessful attempts in September.</p>

<p>3I/ATLAS reached its perihelion on October 29, when it was closest to the Sun. The object had also been at solar conjunction with Earth just days prior, which temporarily blocked it from view.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb, a Harvard astronomer and tracker of 3I/ATLAS, stated, “This is the first radio detection of 3I/ATLAS.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>Dennis Bodewits, a physics professor at Auburn University, commented, “When we detect water — or even its faint ultraviolet echo, OH — from an interstellar comet, we’re reading a note from another planetary system.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior observations by NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope had suggested that 3I/ATLAS is primarily composed of carbon dioxide ice, with water making up only four percent of its mass. However, astronomers previously detected hydroxyl gas, a sign of water, in ultraviolet spectrum data from NASA’s Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory.</p>

<p>These findings highlight the potential for studying the chemistry of planetary systems beyond our own, indicating that the ingredients for life may not be unique to Earth.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to study 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Jupiter in March 2026. NASA’s Juno spacecraft will search for radio signals from the object during its close pass.</p>
