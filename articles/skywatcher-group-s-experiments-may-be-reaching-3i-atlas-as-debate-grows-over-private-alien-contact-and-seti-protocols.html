      <h2>Skywatcher Group’s Experiments May Be Reaching 3I/ATLAS as Debate Grows Over Private Alien Contact and SETI Protocols</h2>

<p>Members of the Skywatcher Group have conducted nightly experiments in a secluded area of the American Southwest since earlier this year, claiming to summon aerial phenomena. The group, founded by Jake Barber, a former Air Force Special Operations veteran, utilizes a combination of low-frequency signaling technology and synchronized meditation techniques they refer to as “psionic calling.” The activities have sparked debate about their potential interaction with the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, which has exhibited several anomalies.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as researchers, both governmental and independent, are questioning whether the Skywatcher Group's experiments could unintentionally communicate with 3I/ATLAS. The object has shown unusual characteristics, including an “anti-tail” of particles directed toward the Sun, and unexplained variations in brightness. The discussion raises concerns about private groups engaging in potential extraterrestrial contact and the implications for existing protocols like SETI.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Location: American Southwest</li>
    <li>Founder: Jake Barber, former Air Force Special Operations veteran</li>
    <li>Technique: “Psionic calling” combining electronics and meditation</li>
    <li>Object of interest: 3I/ATLAS, detected earlier in 2025</li>
    <li>Notable anomalies: “Anti-tail” of particles, variations in brightness</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The Skywatcher Group has operated in the American Southwest since earlier this year, conducting nightly experiments to summon aerial phenomena. 3I/ATLAS was first detected in 2025, with researchers noting its unusual characteristics that differ from typical comets or asteroids.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The results are evidence of successful non-human contact,” said Jake Barber, referring to the visible lights and craft-like objects reported by the Skywatcher Group.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“To skeptics, they are coincidence, illusion, or something yet unexplained,” Barber added, acknowledging the divided opinions on their experiments.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The controversy surrounding the Skywatcher Group has intensified as more researchers consider the implications of their activities. The debate touches on broader themes of private engagement in extraterrestrial research and the need for established protocols, such as those governed by the SETI framework.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As discussions continue, researchers and authorities may further investigate the potential interactions between the Skywatcher Group's activities and 3I/ATLAS, assessing the implications for communication with non-human intelligence.</p>
