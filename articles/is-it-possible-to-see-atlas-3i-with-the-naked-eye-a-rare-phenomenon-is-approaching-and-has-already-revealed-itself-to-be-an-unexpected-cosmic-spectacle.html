      <h2>Is it possible to see ATLAS 3I with the naked eye? A rare phenomenon is approaching and has already revealed itself to be an unexpected cosmic spectacle.</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I ATLAS, identified in 2025, has sparked interest among the public and astronomers. It is the third object confirmed to cross the Solar System from outside, an event of significant scientific value. However, authorities have confirmed that 3I ATLAS is not visible to the naked eye.</p>

<p>This comet's trajectory and composition intrigue experts, but its low brightness has limited direct observation. Astronomers have noted that while 3I ATLAS remains invisible without telescopes, it represents an important opportunity to learn about distant planetary systems.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I ATLAS identified as an interstellar comet in 2025.</li>
    <li>It is the third confirmed object from outside the Solar System.</li>
    <li>The comet's brightness has remained too low for naked-eye visibility.</li>
    <li>C/2024 G3 (ATLAS), discovered in April 2024, achieved a brightness visible during the day.</li>
    <li>3I ATLAS follows a hyperbolic trajectory, passing close to the Sun before returning to deep space.</li>
    <li>3I ATLAS is cataloged as C/2025 N1.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In April 2024, astronomers discovered C/2024 G3 (ATLAS), which later became visible to millions due to its brightness. On January 13, 2025, this comet reached perihelion, its closest point to the Sun. Shortly after, it experienced nuclear fragmentation, leading to its partial disintegration.</p>
<p>In contrast, 3I ATLAS has not been visible. It has remained an object of study and interest for experts seeking to understand its origins and characteristics.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The rarity and value of interstellar visitors like 3I ATLAS offer crucial insights into the composition of distant planetary systems,” said an unnamed astronomer.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I ATLAS has sparked discussions in the astronomical community due to its interstellar nature. In comparison, C/2024 G3 (ATLAS) provided a spectacular visual experience, capturing public interest and media attention. The differences between these comets highlight the diversity of astronomical phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I ATLAS continues its journey through the Solar System, astronomers will monitor its path and collect data. Future observations may provide further insights into the characteristics of interstellar bodies.</p>
