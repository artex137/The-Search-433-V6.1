      <h2>Alleged NASA Leak Says 3I/ATLAS Sends Strange Pulses at Alien Search Frequency</h2>

<p>A viral claim has emerged online suggesting that an alleged NASA leak indicates interstellar object 3I/ATLAS is emitting unusual pulse waves at a frequency of 1,420 megahertz, the same frequency used by the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) to search for alien life. This claim has sparked renewed public interest in the possibility of extraterrestrial communication.</p>

<p>The allegations have gained traction through social media platforms, particularly TikTok, where videos have circulated discussing the supposed signals from 3I/ATLAS. Authorities in the scientific community are approaching these claims with caution, emphasizing that no peer-reviewed research or official confirmation has substantiated the reports of artificial radio waves from the object.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>3I/ATLAS is an interstellar object that entered the solar system after 'Oumuamua.</li>
  <li>The alleged signals are said to be at 1,420 MHz, a frequency associated with hydrogen emissions.</li>
  <li>No peer-reviewed studies or official NASA confirmations have verified these claims.</li>
  <li>Astronomers have detected hydroxyl absorption lines at 1,665 MHz and 1,667 MHz, linked to natural water molecules.</li>
  <li>The SETI Institute notes that 1,420 MHz is naturally active in the cosmos and may not indicate artificial signals.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been the subject of astronomical research since its discovery. The object has recently attracted attention due to claims that it is emitting structured radio pulse patterns.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, social media discussions intensified, particularly on platforms like TikTok, where users shared videos claiming to show the pulse sequence from 3I/ATLAS. These claims have not been substantiated by scientific evidence.</p>
<p>Experts have reiterated the need for caution regarding unverified signals, highlighting that extraordinary claims must be backed by extraordinary evidence.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“While 1,420 MHz remains a critical listening frequency, it is also naturally active in the cosmos,” said a representative from the SETI Institute. “Numerous natural sources can emit or absorb energy in this band.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“No confirmed radio transmission from the interstellar body has been detected beyond these absorption detections,” a report from WIRED noted.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The 1,420 MHz frequency, known as the hydrogen line, has long been a key focus for SETI researchers. It is considered a prime candidate for interstellar communication due to its universal nature and minimal interference from cosmic noise.</p>
<p>Previous unexplained cosmic radio signals, such as the 'Wow!' signal detected in 1977, have also drawn significant media attention and public intrigue regarding the search for extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Experts continue to monitor the situation, urging caution regarding the claims surrounding 3I/ATLAS. Investigations into the object will proceed, but as of now, no further evidence has emerged to support the assertion of artificial signals.</p>
