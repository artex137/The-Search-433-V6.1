      <h2>Interstellar visitor 3I/ATLAS pulls away from sun in shocking move</h2>

<p>Scientists have observed the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS making an unexpected maneuver as it approached the sun on October 29, 2023. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) reported that the object exhibited 'non-gravitational acceleration' during its closest approach, suggesting it has been pushed by an unidentified force.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it raises questions about the nature of 3I/ATLAS, which is largely believed to be a comet. Authorities are continuing to monitor the object closely as it exhibits unusual behavior, including increased brightness and a color change that deviates from typical comet characteristics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Date of closest approach:</strong> October 29, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Agency:</strong> NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)</li>
    <li><strong>Acceleration type:</strong> Non-gravitational</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Approximately 7.5 times faster than normal comets</li>
    <li><strong>Color change:</strong> Turned bluer than the sun at perihelion</li>
    <li><strong>Mass loss estimate:</strong> About 10 percent in one month</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 29, 2023, 3I/ATLAS reached its closest point to the sun, where it displayed unexpected acceleration not explained by gravity. As it neared the sun, astronomers observed the object becoming significantly brighter and changing color.</p>

<p>Harvard physicist Avi Loeb noted that these features, including a backward 'anti-tail' that shifted to a normal tail, suggest the object may not be an ordinary comet. He highlighted that the object’s unusual trajectory and chemical composition have sparked further investigation into its true nature.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The observed features are surprising but could be explained in both natural or artificial scenarios,” said Avi Loeb. “The blue color could be a signature of ionized carbon monoxide or a hot engine. The non-gravitational acceleration could be a result of cometary evaporation or technological propulsion.”
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is not the first time 3I/ATLAS has raised eyebrows in the scientific community. Loeb previously identified what he termed the ninth anomaly associated with the object. He calculated that the odds of all these strange occurrences happening simultaneously are one in 10 quadrillion.</p>

<p>Loeb has expressed concern that some scientists prioritize reputation over the potential implications of their findings. He emphasizes the need for open discourse about the object's unusual characteristics and their possible significance.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to observe 3I/ATLAS as it moves through the solar system, with particular attention to its mass loss and any changes in its trajectory. Upcoming observations in November and December may provide further insights into the object's behavior and composition.</p>
