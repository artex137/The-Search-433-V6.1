      <h2>Psychic Uri Geller claims Obama admitted UFOs – not at Area 51</h2>

<p>Uri Geller, a well-known psychic, has claimed that former U.S. President Barack Obama has admitted to the existence of UFOs, but not in the context of Area 51. Geller made the statement during an interview on October 30, 2023, in a discussion about UFOs and government disclosures.</p>

<p>This claim has drawn attention as it touches on ongoing public interest in UFO phenomena and government transparency. Authorities have not yet responded to Geller's comments, and it is unclear if any official investigations will follow.</p>
