      <h2>3I/ATLAS: Interstellar Comet or Alien Engine? Jets That Defy Physics Spark Global Debate</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has intrigued astronomers worldwide due to its unusual twin jets, which form stable plumes over millions of kilometres. Observations indicate that the comet has exhibited behaviours that challenge current understanding of cometary physics since it began its approach to the Sun in recent weeks. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This phenomenon has prompted debate among scientists regarding the nature of 3I/ATLAS. Authorities, including NASA and various research institutions, are examining data from multiple telescopes and spacecraft to understand the comet's behaviour and composition. Some scientists suggest that the anomalies could indicate an artificial origin, while others maintain it is a natural comet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Observation Date: 9 November 2025</li>
    <li>Location: Near the Sun, within the Solar System</li>
    <li>Composition: Dominated by carbon dioxide (CO₂), with detectable water (H₂O), carbon monoxide (CO), and dust</li>
    <li>Rotation Period: Approximately 16.16 hours</li>
    <li>Notable Feature: Jets extending over one million kilometres, remaining fixed</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first observed as it entered the Solar System, with various telescopes monitoring its trajectory. On 9 November 2025, long-exposure images captured the comet's jets, revealing their unusual stability and structure. Following this, scientists began detailed analyses of thermal, spectroscopic, and polarimetric data to understand its composition and behaviour.</p>

<p>Recent findings have included the identification of concentric heat rings surrounding the comet's nucleus. These observations have raised questions about whether the jets are driven by conventional solar heating or some other mechanism.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The stable jet alignment and the lack of expected jet smearing raise questions about the natural origin of 3I/ATLAS,” said Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“While we acknowledge the anomalies, the mainstream interpretation remains that 3I/ATLAS is a natural comet,” stated a NASA spokesperson.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The debate surrounding 3I/ATLAS is not unprecedented. Previous interstellar objects have sparked similar discussions, but none have exhibited the same level of puzzling behaviour. The scientific community continues to grapple with the implications of such findings on existing models of cometary behaviour and formation.</p>

<p>Research into comets, particularly those from interstellar origins, has evolved, leading to new theories about their composition and dynamics. 3I/ATLAS serves as a case study in the need for ongoing analysis and potentially revised frameworks.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to analyse data from multiple space missions, including the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and the James Webb Space Telescope. Targeted observations may be conducted to measure jet velocities and mass flux, which could help clarify whether the jets are natural or engineered. Until more data is available, the classification of 3I/ATLAS as a natural comet will remain the default position.</p>
