      <h2>Elon Musk weighs in on claims interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is an ‘alien spaceship’</h2>

<p>A mysterious interstellar comet, known as 3I/ATLAS, has sparked debate among astronomers, with Elon Musk sharing his thoughts on the matter. The SpaceX founder addressed the controversy after a Harvard scientist suggested the comet might not be naturally formed. NASA scientists have confirmed that 3I/ATLAS is the third known object to enter the solar system from outside its borders.</p>

<p>This discussion is significant as it raises questions about the nature of interstellar objects and whether they could be of artificial origin. NASA has stated that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth, but the unusual characteristics of the comet have led to varying interpretations among researchers.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was discovered by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) team in early July using the Hubble Space Telescope.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist, has proposed a 30–40 per cent chance that the comet could be of technological origin.</li>
    <li>The comet features a teardrop-shaped dust cloud around its icy core, approximately the size of Manhattan.</li>
    <li>Nasa has confirmed that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth.</li>
    <li>Elon Musk discussed the comet's chemical makeup on The Joe Rogan Experience, noting the presence of nickel vapour in its gas cloud.</li>
    <li>NASA’s Acting Administrator Sean Duffy has stated that there are “no aliens” and “no threat to life here on Earth.”</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In early July, the ATLAS team identified the comet 3I/ATLAS using the Hubble Space Telescope. Following its discovery, astronomers began analyzing its unusual features, including its tail and “anti-tail.” In a research paper, Avi Loeb suggested the possibility of a technological origin for the comet. Elon Musk later addressed these theories during an appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience, emphasizing the need for open-mindedness regarding the comet's nature.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“One thing I can say is, if I was aware of any evidence of aliens, Joe, you have my word that I will come on your show and reveal it. I keep my promises.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“It would be a very heavy spaceship if you made it all out of nickel. It would, like, obliterate a continent type of thing. Maybe worse.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“There are no aliens and no threat to life here on Earth.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discussion surrounding 3I/ATLAS is not the first of its kind. Previous interstellar objects, such as ‘Oumuamua, have also prompted debates regarding their origins and nature. The scientific community remains divided on the interpretation of such phenomena, with some advocating for a cautious approach that considers all possibilities.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to study 3I/ATLAS as it moves through the solar system. Investigations into its composition and behavior will provide further insights into whether it is a natural comet or something more unusual.</p>
