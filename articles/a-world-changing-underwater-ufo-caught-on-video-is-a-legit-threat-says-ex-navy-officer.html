      <h2>A ‘World-Changing’ Underwater UFO—Caught on Video—Is a Legit Threat, Says Ex-Navy Officer</h2>

<p>Retired U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Timothy Gallaudet has called for the U.S. government to investigate “unidentified submersible objects” (USOs), which he claims could pose a threat to maritime security. Gallaudet made these statements during a recent discussion about the connection between UFOs and USOs, highlighting a 2019 sighting off the coast of San Diego.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as it raises concerns over national security and the safety of naval operations. Gallaudet argues that the unexplored underwater environment is critical to understanding these phenomena and ensuring the security of maritime trade and military operations. He has published a paper titled, “Beneath the Surface: We May Learn More about UAP by Looking in the Ocean,” advocating for increased research into these sightings.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Timothy Gallaudet is a retired U.S. Navy Rear Admiral and former Chief Oceanographer.</li>
    <li>The 2019 sighting involved a Navy warship near San Diego.</li>
    <li>Gallaudet cites incidents of submarines crashing due to lack of knowledge about underwater hazards.</li>
    <li>He references a July 19, 2019, encounter involving the USS Omaha and a transmedium UAP.</li>
    <li>The USS Omaha recorded the UAP using an AN/KAX-2 electro-optical sensor.</li>
    <li>In 2013, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol filmed a UAP near Aguadilla, Puerto Rico.</li>
    <li>Gallaudet has served in various naval oceanography and meteorology commands since 1989.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 19, 2019, the USS Omaha, a Independence-class littoral combat ship, recorded a spherical UAP hovering above the Pacific Ocean. The crew used an AN/KAX-2 electro-optical sensor to capture the object, which eventually disappeared after making a splash as it entered the water.</p>

<p>In 2013, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol personnel captured footage of a spherical object near Aguadilla, Puerto Rico, which appeared to enter and exit the water at high speeds.</p>

<p>In 2022, the NOAA underwater exploration ship Okeanos Explorer discovered unusual holes on the North Atlantic seafloor at a depth of 1.6 miles, which scientists have been unable to explain.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Transmedium USOs and UAPs jeopardize U.S. maritime security.” 
    <strong>—Timothy Gallaudet</strong>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “Over three minutes, the object appears to fly at speeds between 40 and 120 miles per hour, enter and exit the Atlantic Ocean without any significant deceleration.” 
    <strong>—Timothy Gallaudet</strong>
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous incidents involving UAPs have raised questions about military preparedness and the safety of naval operations. Gallaudet's reflections on underwater phenomena highlight a growing interest in understanding how these unidentified objects may impact maritime security.</p>

<p>The U.S. Navy has begun to acknowledge the potential risks associated with UAPs and USOs, but comprehensive research into these phenomena remains limited.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Gallaudet's call for further investigation into USOs could lead to increased scrutiny of maritime security protocols and a push for more research into underwater phenomena related to UAPs.</p>
