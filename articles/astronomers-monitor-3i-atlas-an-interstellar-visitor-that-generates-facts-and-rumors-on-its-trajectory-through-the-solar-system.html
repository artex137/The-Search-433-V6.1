      <h2>Astronomers monitor 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar visitor that generates facts and rumors on its trajectory through the Solar System</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has completed its closest approach to Earth this week, reaching a distance of approximately <strong>270 million kilometers</strong> without posing any risk of collision. Discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile, the comet is the third confirmed visitor from beyond the Solar System, following ‘Oumuamua and Borisov.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it allows scientists to study the comet's composition and trajectory, providing insights into the formation of distant planetary systems. NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) are actively involved in capturing detailed images and data from various missions, including Hubble and James Webb telescopes.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach:</strong> 270 million kilometers from Earth</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Exceeds 200,000 km/h</li>
    <li><strong>Perihelion Date:</strong> October 29, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Core Diameter:</strong> Between 440 meters and 5.6 kilometers</li>
    <li><strong>Next Approach:</strong> Jupiter in March 2026</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers discovered 3I/ATLAS using the ATLAS telescope in Chile. Initial observations confirmed its active status, revealing a coma and diffuse tail. The comet reached perihelion on October 29, 2025, within the orbit of Mars, and began moving away from the Sun. Throughout its journey, various telescopes, including Hubble and James Webb, recorded data, capturing its unique characteristics and emissions.</p>
<p>Post-perihelion observations indicated increased activity, with jets and acceleration attributed to uneven gas sublimation. The comet will approach Jupiter in March 2026 before permanently leaving the Solar System.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The presence of atomic nickel and other elements suggests that 3I/ATLAS formed in an environment different from solar comets,” said an astronomer involved in the study.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“We have seen consistent observations confirming cometary features, and experts have rejected alien hypotheses, reinforcing evidence of natural behavior,” another scientist stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS adds to the growing understanding of interstellar objects and their origins. Previous visitors, such as ‘Oumuamua and Borisov, have provided valuable data that helps researchers understand the dynamics of distant planetary systems. Observations from multiple international missions have highlighted the advances in telescope technology and coordination in studying rare celestial phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following its current trajectory, astronomers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Jupiter. They will analyze data from various missions to further understand its composition and behavior before it exits the Solar System permanently.</p>
