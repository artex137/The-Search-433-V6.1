      <h2>NASA’s Perseverance rover captures mysterious interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS on Mars</h2>

<p>NASA’s Perseverance rover has photographed interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS during its flyby of Mars on October 3, 2025. The image has sparked debates about the comet's nature, with some suggesting it could be an alien spacecraft, while experts attribute its appearance to photographic artifacts.</p>

<p>The comet, first observed by NASA on July 1, 2025, measures approximately 46 kilometers in diameter and travels at about 60 kilometers per second. The opportunity to observe 3I/ATLAS from both Mars and Earth has generated significant interest among astronomers and space enthusiasts. NASA and independent observers are analyzing the raw data to discern between genuine interstellar phenomena and imaging effects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of flyby: October 3, 2025</li>
    <li>Diameter of comet: 46 kilometers</li>
    <li>Speed of comet: 60 kilometers per second</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: 1.8 astronomical units (about 170 million miles)</li>
    <li>First observed by NASA: July 1, 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, NASA first observed interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS. The comet’s unusual trajectory was noted as it follows a hyperbolic path, entering from deep space. On October 1, 2025, amateur astronomer Simeon Schmauß identified a faint light near the comet’s predicted location using data from Perseverance. On October 2, 2025, Stefan Burns compiled a nine-minute time-lapse from the rover’s Mastcam-Z images, showing a bright object rapidly crossing the Martian sky. The flyby occurred on October 3, 2025, generating global attention.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“After stacking 20 images from Mastcam-Z, I found a faint smudge of light in the constellation Corona Borealis near the predicted position,” said Simeon Schmauß, highlighting the potential significance of the observations.</blockquote>

<p>Experts have cautioned that the elongated shape observed in the image may result from the long exposure times used by the rover’s imaging system. “While intriguing to the public, these photographic quirks do not necessarily indicate extraterrestrial technology,” said an expert.</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is classified as the third confirmed interstellar visitor to the solar system, following ‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. The comet’s unusual speed and trajectory have led some, including Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb, to speculate about its origins, suggesting it may not be a natural object. However, most scientists attribute its characteristics to natural cometary processes.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and astronomers will continue to analyze the data from the Perseverance rover to verify the observations of 3I/ATLAS. Ongoing studies aim to deepen understanding of interstellar objects and their behaviors as they pass through the solar system.</p>
