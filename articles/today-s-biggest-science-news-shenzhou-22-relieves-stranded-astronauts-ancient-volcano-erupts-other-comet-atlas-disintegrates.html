      <h2>Comet 3I ATLAS Disintegrates as Scientists Observe in Real Time</h2>

<p>Scientists have reported that the comet C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) has begun to disintegrate, breaking into multiple pieces in the skies above Earth. The event has unfolded over the past week, with detailed observations captured between November 12 and November 20, 2025.</p>

<p>This disintegration is significant as it showcases the dynamic nature of comets and raises questions about the stability of these celestial bodies. Researchers are studying the breakup to understand the processes that lead to such events, which could provide insights into the composition and behavior of comets in general.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) has broken into three visible chunks, with a fourth piece not yet identified.</li>
    <li>The disintegration was observed from November 12 to November 20, 2025.</li>
    <li>The event was documented by astrophotographer Michael Jäger.</li>
    <li>The comet is not related to the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which is set for a close encounter with Earth on December 19, 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 12, 2025, astrophotographer Michael Jäger first captured images of comet C/2025 K1 (ATLAS). Over the next eight days, he documented the comet breaking apart into several distinct pieces. By November 20, the disintegration was confirmed, with scientists actively monitoring the event to gather data.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The breakup of C/2025 K1 is an extraordinary event that allows us to study the life cycle of comets,” said a spokesperson for the research team observing the disintegration.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comets are known to exhibit unpredictable behavior, and disintegration events have been observed in the past. The study of such occurrences helps scientists understand the physical and chemical processes affecting these bodies in space. The impending close approach of 3I/ATLAS adds further interest to the current observations.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor the remnants of C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) as they gather data that may lead to a better understanding of cometary behavior and composition. Further analysis will be conducted to determine the implications of this disintegration for future comet observations.</p>
