      <p class="byline">Published 2025-11-21 19:26 UTC</p>

      <h2>Icy core of 3I/ATLAS activates red coma during passage by Mars</h2>

<p>Astronomers have confirmed the detection of comet 3I/ATLAS, the third interstellar object to visit the Solar System, on July 1, 2025. The comet, which travels at a speed of 250,000 kilometers per hour, passed within 30 million kilometers of Mars on October 3, 2025, according to the Agência Espacial Europeia (ESA).</p>

<p>This event is significant as it allows scientists to analyze the comet's composition and understand more about its origins. ESA has deployed probes in Martian orbit to capture images of the comet's nucleus and coma. These observations are crucial because 3I/ATLAS follows a hyperbolic trajectory, preventing it from entering a permanent orbit around the Sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of detection: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Date of closest approach to Mars: October 3, 2025</li>
    <li>Speed: 250,000 kilometers per hour</li>
    <li>Minimum distance to Earth: 270 million kilometers on December 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Estimated core diameter: 300 meters to 5.6 kilometers</li>
    <li>Perihelion distance: 210 million kilometers from the Sun</li>
    <li>Instruments used: CaSSIS, Mars Express, Hubble, James Webb</li>
    <li>Next observation by Juice mission: November 2-23, 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS entered the inner Solar System in June 2025, with pre-discovery observations retrieved from telescopes like the Zwicky Transient Facility. The comet's orbit, characterized by an eccentricity greater than 6, confirms its extrasolar origin from the direction of the constellation Sagittarius.</p>

<p>On October 29, 2025, the comet reached perihelion, located between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, allowing for continuous monitoring by various telescopes. Initial observations indicated comet activity as early as May 2025, when the object was 6.4 astronomical units from the Sun.</p>

<p>NASA's Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory detected complex jets of gas and dust emerging from the comet's core after perihelion on October 30, 2025. The comet's brightness varied significantly, reaching magnitude 7-8 post-perihelion.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“These observations highlight the versatility of Martian missions in studying distant objects,” said a representative from ESA.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The data collected will help refine models of sublimation in interstellar comets,” noted a scientist involved in the research.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is compared to previous interstellar visitors like ‘Oumuamua, but it exhibits greater gaseous activity. The unique composition of the comet, with high proportions of carbon dioxide compared to water, suggests it formed in a cold region of its original star system.</p>

<p>Prior observations of comets typically show more water and less carbon dioxide. The ongoing study of 3I/ATLAS will provide insights into the formation and evolution of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA's Europa Clipper probe is scheduled to cross the comet's tail between October 30 and November 6, 2025, marking the first collection of interstellar material. ESA’s Hera mission will follow a similar path until November 1, allowing for in situ dust analysis. Observations will continue to refine our understanding of the comet as it fades from view in December 2025.</p>
