      <h2>NASA accused of hiding evidence about interstellar comet 3IATLAS</h2>

<p>Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb has claimed that NASA is withholding critical information regarding the interstellar comet 3IATLAS during a recent appearance on “The Joe Rogan Experience” podcast. Discovered by NASA's ATLAS telescope on July 1, 2025, 3IATLAS is the third observed interstellar object to enter our solar system. Loeb has suggested that there is a 40% chance the comet may be of alien technology.</p>

<p>This matter has raised concerns among scientists and observers, prompting calls for transparency from NASA. The agency has not confirmed any allegations of withholding data or images related to the comet, and has stated that 3IATLAS does not pose a threat to Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3IATLAS discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Perihelion is set for October 30, 2025, at 1.35 astronomical units from the sun.</li>
    <li>Loeb claims a 40% chance the comet is alien technology.</li>
    <li>The best image of 3IATLAS was taken on October 2, 2025, when it was 30 million kilometers from Mars.</li>
    <li>Nasa has not confirmed allegations of data withholding.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>NASA’s ATLAS telescope discovered 3IATLAS on July 1, 2025. The comet is scheduled to reach its perihelion on October 30, 2025. On October 2, 2025, Loeb noted that the best image of the comet was captured while it was 30 million kilometers from Mars. During the podcast, Loeb expressed concerns regarding NASA's lack of response to his requests for data.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Amazingly, the best image was obtained on Oct. 2, 2025, when 3I/ATLAS came within 30 million kilometers of Mars,” said Loeb.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“It’s much more likely not to be related to extraterrestrial intelligence but to terrestrial stupidity,” he added, regarding the lack of data availability.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Nasa has stated that the interstellar object does not pose a threat to Earth and could provide invaluable intel for future planetary protection.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is not the first time claims have been made regarding potential extraterrestrial origins of celestial objects. Previous discussions around interstellar phenomena have sparked debates in the scientific community, emphasizing the need for thorough investigation and open communication.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA is expected to continue monitoring 3IATLAS as it approaches its perihelion. The agency has not indicated any plans to address the allegations made by Loeb, and no further investigations have been announced at this time.</p>
