      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS to Be Visible in the US</h2>
<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS will be visible in the United States from early November to mid-December 2025, astronomers have announced. Discovered on July 1, 2025, the comet is unique as it does not orbit the Sun, making it only the third confirmed interstellar object recorded in our solar system.</p>

<p>This event is significant because 3I/ATLAS is estimated to be at least 7 billion years old, potentially making it twice as old as Earth. Scientists are eager to study this comet to gain insights into the materials from outside our solar system, as it offers a glimpse into the formation of other planetary systems.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Viewing Period:</strong> Early November to mid-December 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Perihelion:</strong> October 30, 2025, at 1.4 astronomical units (AU) from the Sun</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to Earth:</strong> December 19, 2025, at approximately 1.8 AU (about 269 million km)</li>
    <li><strong>Best Viewing Times:</strong> 90 minutes before sunrise</li>
    <li><strong>Visibility:</strong> Estimated magnitude of 12 to 18, requiring a large telescope</li>
    <li><strong>Optimal Viewing Regions:</strong> Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Southern California, Nevada, Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Kansas, Missouri, Illinois</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025. It will reach its closest point to the Sun on October 30, 2025, before passing Earth on December 19, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Objects like 3I/ATLAS offer a rare window into material from outside our solar system,” said a representative from the scientific community. “By studying its composition, motion, and behaviour, we hope to learn how such interstellar visitors compare to the comets that originated in our own solar system.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object to be recorded, following 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Such comets provide valuable information about the early solar system and the processes that formed it.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to observe 3I/ATLAS closely as it travels through our solar system, utilizing instruments on Mars rovers and orbiters to gather data while it is hidden from Earth. Further studies will focus on its composition and behaviour during its approach.</p>
