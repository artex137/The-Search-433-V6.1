      <h2>What’s the truth about the mysterious ‘alien’ space rock?</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has shown a significant increase in brightness as it has exited the solar system, according to researchers. Observations made in December 2025 by NASA's SPHEREx mission revealed this change following the comet's closest approach to the Sun.</p>

<p>This discovery matters as it has sparked theories about the comet's nature, including claims by Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb suggesting it could be an artificial alien probe. The scientific community is closely monitoring the comet’s behavior and composition, as it provides insights into the materials found in the early solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Observation date: December 2025</li>
    <li>Comet designation: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Previous name: A11pl3Z</li>
    <li>Research lead: Carey Lisse, Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory</li>
    <li>Deputy study lead: Yoonsoo Bach, Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute</li>
    <li>Significant brightening observed: two months after closest approach to the Sun</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, the Deep Random Survey telescope captured initial images of Comet 3I/ATLAS as it entered the solar system. Following this, the comet passed its closest distance to the Sun. By December 2025, NASA's SPHEREx space telescope observed a dramatic increase in the comet's brightness, attributed to the venting of water, carbon dioxide, and carbon monoxide.</p>

<p>Researchers have noted that the comet's brightening is linked to the sublimation of water ice and the release of carbon-rich materials from its surface.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Comet 3I/ATLAS was full-on erupting into space in December 2025, after its close flyby of the Sun, causing it to significantly brighten,” said Carey Lisse, lead researcher at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“We are now seeing the usual range of early solar system materials, including organic molecules, soot, and rock dust, that are typically emitted by a comet,” Lisse added.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Yoonsoo Bach stated, “Our unique space telescope is gathering unprecedented data from across the universe. But in this case, our galaxy delivered a piece of a faraway star system to us only a few months after launch.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable as only the third interstellar object discovered in our solar system. Its discovery has prompted discussions about the nature of interstellar objects and their potential implications for understanding the universe. The comet's unusual characteristics have led to significant scientific interest and debate.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to study Comet 3I/ATLAS to gather more data about its composition and behavior as it moves further away from the Sun. Future observations may provide further insights into the early solar system materials it contains.</p>
