      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Approaches Earth</h2>
<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is making its closest approach to Earth at 1 a.m. EST (0600 GMT) on Friday, December 19, 2025. The comet, which is approximately the size of Manhattan, has drawn significant attention from the scientific community as it travels at a comfortable distance of 170 million miles from our planet.</p>

<p>This event marks a rare opportunity for astronomers and the public alike to observe a celestial object that originated from beyond our solar system. NASA has engaged a fleet of instruments to capture images of the comet, as its visibility to the naked eye is limited. The comet's unusual characteristics have sparked discussions about its origins and composition.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is expected to reach its closest point to Earth at 1 a.m. EST (0600 GMT) on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>It was discovered by the NASA-funded ATLAS survey in Chile in July 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet is approximately 7 billion years old, according to theoretical physicist Michio Kaku.</li>
    <li>The comet is currently 170 million miles away from Earth.</li>
    <li>NASA has mobilized instruments, including the Europa Clipper spacecraft, to capture images of the comet.</li>
    <li>The comet is not visible to the naked eye, with a magnitude of approximately 9.5 to 11.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, the NASA-funded ATLAS survey in Chile discovered comet 3I/ATLAS. Since then, the scientific community has closely monitored its trajectory and characteristics. As the comet approaches Earth, astronomers have utilized instruments like the Europa Clipper's Ultraviolet Spectrograph to take images from a distance of 102 million miles.</p>
<p>Avi Loeb, an astrophysicist at Harvard, has provided updates on the comet’s behavior, noting it has not displayed any unusual activity during its flyby.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "So far, so good," regarding the absence of overtly artificial behavior from the comet. He added, “3I/ATLAS did not manoeuvre or display any unusual activity when it came closest to Earth.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loeb also remarked, "At this point, given all the data that we have, I would agree that it's most likely natural, but there are still a lot of things we don't understand about it."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This approach of 3I/ATLAS marks only the third time in history that a comet from outside the solar system has been observed. Previous visitors include 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. The study of such comets offers insights into the materials and conditions present in other star systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As comet 3I/ATLAS continues its journey, astronomers will continue to study its composition and behavior, utilizing various instruments until it fades from view. Observers can track the comet using the Virtual Telescope Project and smart telescopes positioned to view it in the constellation Leo, near the bright star Regulus.</p>
