      <h2>Michael Kueppers, ESA astrophysicist: “It’s almost impossible to know where 3I/ATLAS comes from”</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, discovered this summer and located approximately 190 million miles from Earth, has sparked significant public interest due to its unique origin outside our solar system. Michael Küppers, an astrophysicist with the European Space Agency (ESA), has provided insights into the comet's nature and the ongoing efforts to observe it.</p>

<p>The significance of 3I/ATLAS lies in its classification as the third interstellar comet discovered, offering a rare opportunity to study conditions from another star system. In response to its unexpected trajectory and composition, space agencies have initiated a special observation program to track and analyze the comet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in summer 2023.</li>
    <li>It is located approximately 190 million miles from Earth.</li>
    <li>The comet follows an eccentric trajectory with an eccentricity of 6.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar comet discovered, following 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov.</li>
    <li>ESA's JUICE satellite is positioned to observe the comet during its perihelion.</li>
    <li>Observation campaigns have been launched by the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified in summer 2023. As it approached perihelion, scientists noted its unique characteristics, including its high speed and active behavior. The ESA and other space agencies initiated observation programs to gather data on the comet's composition and trajectory.</p>

<p>During its perihelion, the comet accelerated unexpectedly, a phenomenon explained by the reaction force from gas and dust expelled as the ice in its nucleus sublimates. This has provided scientists with an opportunity to study its behavior closely.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This is a unique event – something we rarely get to see – so there’s a lot of scientific and public fascination,” said Michael Küppers.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Observation, usually from Earth, is our only option,” Küppers added, emphasizing the importance of tracking such objects.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS follows the identification of 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017, which garnered significant attention as the first interstellar object observed passing through our solar system. The second, 2I/Borisov, received less public interest, likely due to the pandemic. The ongoing fascination with 3I/ATLAS reflects a growing interest in interstellar research and the potential insights these objects provide about other star systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Space agencies will continue to gather data on 3I/ATLAS during its observation campaign, aiming to learn more about its composition and physical characteristics. Future missions, such as ESA's Comet Interceptor planned for 2028 or 2029, will further enhance our understanding of comets from both our and other solar systems.</p>
