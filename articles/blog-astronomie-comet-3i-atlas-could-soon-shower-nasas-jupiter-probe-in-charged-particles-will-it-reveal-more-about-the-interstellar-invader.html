      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS May Affect NASA's Europa Clipper Probe</h2>

<p>NASA's Europa Clipper spacecraft could soon encounter charged particles from the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, according to researchers from the European Space Agency. The potential interaction is expected to occur between October 30 and November 6, 2025, as 3I/ATLAS approaches its closest point to the sun.</p>

<p>This event is significant because it presents a rare opportunity to directly sample material from an interstellar comet. Researchers have highlighted the importance of studying cometary bodies, which act as time capsules containing material from their formation billions of years ago. However, the ongoing U.S. government shutdown raises concerns about whether the Europa Clipper's instruments can be activated in time to make the necessary measurements.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS will reach perihelion on October 29, 2025, at a distance of 126 million miles (200 million kilometers) from the sun.</li>
    <li>Europa Clipper is currently over 186 million miles (300 million kilometers) from the sun.</li>
    <li>The alignment for potential particle detection will occur between October 30 and November 6, 2025.</li>
    <li>The U.S. government shutdown may impact the activation of Europa Clipper's instruments.</li>
    <li>Researchers Samuel Grant and Geraint Jones have developed a program called Tailcatcher to predict ion tail crossings.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On August 27, 2025, the comet 3I/ATLAS was imaged by the Gemini South telescope. Researchers have since predicted that charged particles from the comet's ion tail could intersect with NASA's Europa Clipper spacecraft as it travels towards Jupiter. The comet will reach perihelion on October 29, 2025, and Europa Clipper will be in position to potentially detect these particles between October 30 and November 6, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We study cometary bodies because they act as time capsules, sealing in material from their formation billions of years ago,” said Samuel Grant of the Finnish Meteorological Institute.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Sampling the tail in this way is the closest we can currently get to a direct sample of such an object, and thus a different part of the galaxy,” Grant added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous successful predictions of ion tail crossings have been made using the Tailcatcher program, such as the detection of ions from the comet C/2019 Y4 by the European Space Agency's Solar Orbiter spacecraft in 2020. The upcoming Comet Interceptor mission, set to launch in 2029, aims to sample the coma and head of an interstellar or long-period comet.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the situation develops, it remains unclear if the U.S. government shutdown will be resolved in time for Europa Clipper to make the measurements. If the spacecraft can be activated, the findings may provide valuable insights into the composition of interstellar comets compared to those from our own solar system.</p>
