      <h2>This Comet Suddenly Started Spinning Backward Near the Sun, and Scientists Don’t Know Why</h2>

<p>Comet 41P/Tuttle-Giacobini-Kresák has exhibited unusual spinning behavior as it approaches the sun, with astronomers noting a significant change in its rotation from March to May 2017. The comet's rotation slowed from approximately 20 hours to 46 hours before it appeared to stop and then reverse direction. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this celestial event.</p>

<p>This phenomenon is significant because it challenges existing theories about comet behavior and raises questions about the nature of smaller comets in the solar system. Researchers are studying Comet 41P closely, particularly as it is expected to return to the sun in 2028. NASA's Swift satellite and the Hubble Space Telescope have provided critical data for this analysis.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 41P/Tuttle-Giacobini-Kresák slowed its rotation from 20 hours to 46 hours between March and May 2017.</li>
    <li>By December 2017, the comet was spinning once every 14 hours in the opposite direction.</li>
    <li>The comet is expected to return near the sun in 2028.</li>
    <li>NASA's Swift satellite and Hubble Space Telescope have been used to study its behavior.</li>
    <li>Research suggests that smaller comets may be rarer than previously thought.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In March 2017, Comet 41P/Tuttle-Giacobini-Kresák began to slow its rotation from about 20 hours to 46 hours. By May 2017, the comet appeared to stop spinning altogether. In December 2017, astronomers reported that the comet had reversed its spin, rotating once every 14 hours. This unusual behavior has caught the attention of researchers.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Comets seem to know we are watching and are performing tricks for our entertainment,” said astronomer David Jewitt from the University of California, Los Angeles, in reference to the unusual behavior of Comet 41P.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comets are remnants from the early solar system and can exhibit dramatic changes in rotation and behavior as they approach the sun. While rotational changes are not uncommon, the scale of Comet 41P's change is particularly striking, as it shifted by dozens of hours rather than minutes. This finding may lead to new insights about the lifecycle of smaller comets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to monitor Comet 41P as it approaches the sun again in 2028. They aim to observe its behavior closely, especially with upcoming surveys from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile, to better understand the dynamics of comets and their potential to disintegrate due to rapid spinning.</p>
