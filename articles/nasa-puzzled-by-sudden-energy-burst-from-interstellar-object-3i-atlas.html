      <h2>NASA Puzzled by Sudden Energy Burst from Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Astronomers are on high alert after interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has streaked into the Solar System, unleashing a surge of energy and gas unlike anything seen before. The comet, travelling at over 200,000 km/h, has surprised scientists with its carbon dioxide-rich emissions and hyperbolic path, which ensures it will never return.</p>

<p>This event matters because 3I/ATLAS could contain material older than the Sun itself, offering a rare glimpse into the birthplaces of other worlds. Observations from NASA and the James Webb Space Telescope suggest the comet's unusual composition could change our understanding of how planets form around distant stars.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered on July 1, 2025, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS).</li>
    <li>Travelling at over 209,000 km/h (130,000 mph) as it approaches perihelion on October 29.</li>
    <li>Will pass about 200 million kilometres (126 million miles) from the Sun.</li>
    <li>Third confirmed interstellar object after ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov.</li>
    <li>Emissions include intense releases of gas, dust, and traces of nickel and cyanide.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been observed to behave like a comet, a frozen body of gas and dust. In recent weeks, space telescopes and ground-based instruments detected a sharp rise in the object's emissions, including a significant increase in carbon dioxide compared to water vapour.</p>
<p>NASA reported that the comet began outgassing while still about 6.4 astronomical units (approximately 960 million kilometres) from the Sun, an area where solar heating typically does not trigger sublimation. This unusual activity has led to further scrutiny by scientists.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Even comets in our solar system can brighten suddenly if a pocket of ice sublimates and drives off dust,” a NASA spokesperson said, dismissing claims of alien origin.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “These are time capsules that seal in material from their formation billions of years ago,” NASA noted regarding interstellar objects like 3I/ATLAS.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object to pass through the solar system, following ‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. The unusual light emissions and activity have led to speculation about the object's nature, but most researchers caution against interpreting this as evidence of intelligence.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is expected to become more active as it approaches perihelion later this month. Its ion tail may intersect with NASA's Europa Clipper spacecraft, allowing scientists to sample particles from another star system, presenting an unprecedented opportunity for study.</p>
