      <h2>Earliest images of mysterious interstellar object reveal alien solar system origins</h2>

<p>Scientists have released new images of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, revealing its unusual behavior as it travels through our solar system. Researchers from Michigan State University (MSU) announced the findings on September 20, 2025, indicating that the object was emitting gas and dust months before its official discovery in July.</p>

<p>This discovery matters because it suggests that 3I/ATLAS may have originated from a solar system with different conditions than our own. The findings could provide insights into the formation of planets and comets in other star systems. Scientists are using the data to better understand the object's composition and behavior as it approaches the sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was officially discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Images revealing its activity were taken between May 7 and June 2, 2025.</li>
    <li>The object was approximately 558 million miles from the sun when it began emitting gas.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will make its closest approach to Mars on October 3, 2025.</li>
    <li>It will reach its closest point to Earth on December 17, 2025, at about 223 million miles away.</li>
    <li>The study has been published in the Astrophysical Journal Letters.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Researchers have utilized images from NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) to track 3I/ATLAS. The object was first detected in TESS images taken in early May 2025. By July 1, 2025, it was officially discovered, revealing its unusual characteristics.</p>
<p>As scientists analyzed the TESS images, they noted that 3I/ATLAS appeared brighter than expected, indicating gas emissions months before it reached the inner solar system. This behavior is atypical for comets, which usually begin to emit gases as they near the sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS gives us an opportunity to study other solar systems up close and personal, without actually needing to visit them,” said Adina Feinstein, assistant professor of physics and astronomy at MSU.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Capturing as many observations from this prediscovery period... is essential to our understanding of how these objects 'turn on' as they approach our sun,” stated John Noonan, a postdoctoral fellow at Auburn University.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The behavior of 3I/ATLAS challenges existing knowledge about comets in our solar system. Traditional comets primarily release water vapor and carbon dioxide as they approach the sun. The unusual activity of 3I/ATLAS suggests it may contain a different composition, potentially including carbon-based ices that vaporize at lower temperatures.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to study 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth. Further observations will help clarify its chemical makeup and the implications for understanding other solar systems.</p>
