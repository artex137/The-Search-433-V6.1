      <h2>Alien Talk Fades Around Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS as New Searches Find No Signals and Images Turn Green</h2>

<p>On January 7, 2026, astronomers have reported no evidence of radio “technosignatures” from interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS during a search conducted with the Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia. The new findings indicate that the comet, which is currently on a one-time trajectory through the solar system, is likely a natural object rather than an artificial spacecraft.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as 3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed object to have entered the solar system from interstellar space. It is now moving away from the Sun, and as it recedes, it will become fainter, limiting future observational opportunities. Researchers connected to the Breakthrough Listen project have emphasized the importance of understanding this comet as they prepare for more interstellar objects expected to be flagged in future sky surveys.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of the Green Bank Telescope search: January 7, 2026</li>
    <li>Distance of 3I/ATLAS from the Sun at closest approach: approximately 203 million km (126 million miles)</li>
    <li>Closest pass to the Sun occurred on November 6, 2025</li>
    <li>Previous interstellar visitors: 1I/‘Oumuamua (2017), 2I/Borisov (2019)</li>
    <li>New image from Gemini North telescope taken on November 26, 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 6, 2025, NASA’s Europa Clipper spacecraft used its ultraviolet spectrograph to observe 3I/ATLAS after its closest approach to the Sun. On November 26, 2025, the Gemini North telescope captured an image of the comet displaying a green hue due to gases boiling off as it warmed. Finally, on January 7, 2026, the Green Bank Telescope search yielded no signs of alien technology from the comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We all would have been thrilled to find technosignatures coming from 3I/ATLAS, but they’re just not there,” said Benjamin Jacobson-Bell of the University of California, Berkeley.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“We’re still scratching our heads about some of the things we’re seeing,” said Kurt Retherford, principal investigator for the Europa Clipper instrument.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has garnered significant attention due to its rarity as an interstellar visitor. The previous confirmed interstellar objects, 1I/‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have contributed to a growing interest in understanding such phenomena. The current findings from the Green Bank Telescope and other instruments may help establish a baseline for identifying and studying future interstellar comets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue analyzing data from the Europa Clipper and the European Space Agency’s JUICE mission to gain further insights into 3I/ATLAS. The Breakthrough Listen study remains to be peer-reviewed, and ground-based observers will monitor the comet for any late outbursts as it dims.</p>
