      <h2>New images of interstellar object 3I/ATLAS reignite debate over whether it is a comet or something artificial</h2>

<p>Fresh observations of interstellar object 3I/ATLAS have reopened a scientific debate regarding its true nature, as new photographs show the object emerging intact after its close pass behind the sun. The images, captured on November 11 by the Nordic Optical Telescope in Spain's Canary Islands, have prompted Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb to reiterate his claim that the object may be artificial, while many astronomers maintain that it behaves like a typical comet.</p>

<p>This ongoing discussion is significant for the field of astrophysics as it challenges existing theories about the behavior of interstellar objects. Authorities continue to analyze the observations to determine the object's composition and behavior, as well as its implications for understanding similar celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Observation date: November 11, 2023</li>
    <li>Location: Nordic Optical Telescope, Canary Islands, Spain</li>
    <li>Key figure: Avi Loeb, Harvard astrophysicist</li>
    <li>Current status of 3I/ATLAS: Intact after solar perihelion</li>
    <li>Additional observations: Hydroxyl absorption lines detected by MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In late October 2023, the MeerKAT radio telescope detected hydroxyl absorption lines from 3I/ATLAS, indicating water molecules breaking apart in sunlight. On November 11, new images from the Nordic Optical Telescope showed the interstellar object intact after its closest approach to the sun.</p>

<p>Avi Loeb has argued that the powerful jets observed streaming from ATLAS suggest it could be an engineered spacecraft rather than a natural comet, challenging prevailing views in the scientific community.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The jets appear far too powerful for a nucleus of its estimated size. Solar energy alone could not produce such large-scale outflows without requiring a surface area larger than Manhattan,” said Avi Loeb regarding his observations of 3I/ATLAS.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “The survival of ATLAS is exactly what I expected. Based on estimates from Hubble observations, ATLAS likely has a nucleus up to a few kilometres in size,” stated Darryl Seligman, an astronomy professor at Michigan State University.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This debate follows previous discussions surrounding the nature of interstellar objects. Loeb's hypotheses about 3I/ATLAS have sparked interest and skepticism in the scientific community, particularly concerning the classification of celestial bodies and their origins.</p>

<p>While some experts support Loeb's view, the majority remain unconvinced, attributing the object's behavior to natural comet activity rather than artificial origins.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to study 3I/ATLAS and its characteristics, aiming to resolve the ongoing debate about its nature. Further observations and analyses are expected to shed light on this scientific mystery.</p>
