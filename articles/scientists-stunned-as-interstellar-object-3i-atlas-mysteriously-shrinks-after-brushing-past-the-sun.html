      <h2>Scientists stunned as interstellar object 3I/ATLAS mysteriously shrinks after brushing past the Sun</h2>

<p>NASA scientists have reported that interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has unexpectedly shrunk by 13% after its close encounter with the Sun last month. This event occurred just weeks before the object's closest approach to Earth, scheduled for December 19, 2025.</p>

<p>This unusual phenomenon has raised questions among researchers about the nature of 3I/ATLAS. Harvard Professor Avi Loeb, who has been studying the object since summer, stated that the shrinkage correlates with a sudden change in its trajectory as it neared the Sun. The implications of this event could challenge current understanding of comet behavior and the origins of 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS shrank by 13% after passing near the Sun in October 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth is expected on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>NASA scientists confirmed the shrinkage and absence of a comet tail on November 5, 2025.</li>
    <li>Professor Avi Loeb has suggested the object might be an alien spacecraft.</li>
    <li>A telescope in Chile detected a sudden increase in the object's speed.</li>
    <li>NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory stated the object's movement cannot be explained by solar gravity.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In October 2025, 3I/ATLAS passed close to the Sun, leading to a reported shrinkage of 13%. Following this event, NASA released images on November 5, 2025, showing no comet tail or gas trails. On December 19, 2025, the object is expected to make its closest approach to Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“For a typical comet, this should have resulted in a massive coma with dust and gas… pointing away from the Sun,” said Professor Avi Loeb. “No such tail is visible in the new images from November 5, 2025.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The odds of 3I/ATLAS showing 10 strange anomalies at the same time are astronomical,” Loeb added, highlighting the object's unusual behavior.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been under scrutiny since its discovery, with scientists observing its behavior as it travels through the solar system. The object has shown multiple anomalies, including an "anti-tail" that points toward the Sun, which is atypical for comets. Such characteristics have prompted discussions about the possibility of an artificial origin.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists and space watchers are eagerly awaiting the close approach of 3I/ATLAS on December 19, 2025, which may provide further insights into the object's true nature and clarify the ongoing debate about its origins.</p>
