      <h2>3I/ATLAS: Interstellar visitor back again? Hubble image, times to spot – all you need to know</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has returned to the spotlight following a new image released by NASA from the Hubble Space Telescope, taken on November 30. The image confirms that the comet remains active after its recent passage near the Sun and assists astronomers in refining its trajectory through the inner solar system.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as 3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object ever observed. Each new image allows scientists to study the composition and behavior of icy bodies from other star systems, comparing them to comets formed around our own Sun. NASA and other space agencies are currently monitoring the comet's path closely.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>New Hubble image captured on November 30.</li>
    <li>Perihelion measured at approximately 1.4 AU (just inside Mars’ orbit).</li>
    <li>Current distance from Earth is hundreds of millions of kilometers.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth is expected around December 19.</li>
    <li>Best viewing times: 
        <ul>
            <li>North America: 4:00–6:00 am ET</li>
            <li>UK/Europe: 05:00–07:00 GMT</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>NASA's Hubble Space Telescope captured a fresh image of 3I/ATLAS on November 30, confirming its ongoing activity after its solar flyby. In September, NASA’s Psyche spacecraft provided multispectral snapshots that helped refine the comet’s trajectory. The European Space Agency's JUICE mission also detected signs of the comet's activity as it brightened this season.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The new Hubble image shows a compact, bright nucleus wrapped in a soft, slightly lopsided coma,” NASA reported. “Background stars appear as streaks because Hubble tracked the comet’s motion—another sign that 3I/ATLAS is still active well after its solar flyby.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is significant as it is only the third interstellar object confirmed by astronomers. Previous observations of interstellar comets have provided insight into the differences between these bodies and those formed in our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches its closest point to Earth, astronomers will continue to monitor its trajectory and activity, providing updates on its visibility and characteristics.</p>
