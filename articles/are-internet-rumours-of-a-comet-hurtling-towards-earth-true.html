      <h2>Are internet rumours of a comet hurtling towards Earth true?</h2>

<p>Space agencies have confirmed that the comet 3I/ATLAS poses no danger to Earth, despite widespread conspiracy claims circulating on social media. The comet was detected by NASA’s ATLAS telescope on July 1, 2025, and has since sparked alarm among users who suggest it is on a collision course with our planet.</p>

<p>The significance of these claims has prompted investigations by various agencies, including the European Space Agency (ESA), which have reiterated that 3I/ATLAS does not threaten Earth or any other celestial bodies. NASA has noted that the comet will safely pass at a distance far greater than the distance between Earth and the Sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS detected by NASA on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth was approximately 270 million kilometres on July 21, 2025.</li>
    <li>Comet travels at around 210,000 kilometres per hour.</li>
    <li>Diameter estimated between 440 metres and 5.6 kilometres.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun is expected on October 30, 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Rumours began circulating on September 29, 2025, after the New York Post published a story titled: “‘Massive’ comet hurtling toward us is larger than previously thought, could be alien tech, scientist says: ‘It could change everything for us’.” The article prompted social media users to share and amplify claims of a potential threat.</p>

<p>On September 30, 2025, a meeting of US military leaders, chaired by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, led to further speculation about military readiness regarding the comet.</p>

<p>Investigations by Al Jazeera’s fact-checking agency, SANAD, confirmed that the comet poses no threat to Earth, countering claims of military movements and international coordination to intercept it.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“NASA confirms that 3I/ATLAS poses no danger to Earth,” the agency stated. “The closest distance to Earth was more than 2.5 times that between Earth and the Sun.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“This comet presents a rare opportunity for scientists to study an interstellar visitor as it passes through our solar system,” NASA added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to the emergence of 3I/ATLAS, similar concerns had arisen regarding other celestial bodies, but investigations consistently showed that such objects usually pose minimal risk to Earth. Space agencies regularly monitor near-Earth objects to assess any potential threats.</p>

<p>The spread of misinformation regarding 3I/ATLAS highlights ongoing challenges in public understanding of astronomical phenomena and the importance of credible sources in disseminating information.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun, providing ongoing updates to the public and scientific community. There are currently no investigations or charges pending related to the spread of misinformation about the comet.</p>
