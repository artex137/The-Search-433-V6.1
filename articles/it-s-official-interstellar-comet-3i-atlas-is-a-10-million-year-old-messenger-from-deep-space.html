      <h2>It’s official – Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS is a 10-million-year-old messenger from deep space</h2>

<p>Astronomers in Spain have confirmed that comet 3I/ATLAS is an interstellar object that has traveled through the galaxy for over 10 million years before passing close to the Sun. The comet poses no threat to Earth and has sparked excitement among scientists eager to study its origins.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant because 3I/ATLAS offers insights into the formation of distant star systems and the early universe. Researchers are now racing to gather data about the comet, which is only the third confirmed interstellar object, following ‘Oumuamua and comet 2I/Borisov.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first spotted on July 1 from a Chilean observatory.</li>
    <li>The comet's closest approach to Earth is approximately 270 million kilometers (168 million miles).</li>
    <li>It has traveled through the galaxy for over 10 million years.</li>
    <li>This object is the third confirmed interstellar object.</li>
    <li>The research was conducted by astronomers at the CITIC research center at the University of A Coruña.</li>
    <li>The European Space Agency's Gaia mission provided stellar data for the research.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, astronomers at a Chilean observatory first detected comet 3I/ATLAS. Initial observations indicated that its trajectory was hyperbolic, confirming it originated from outside the solar system. Following this, a team from the CITIC research center in Spain used advanced simulations to trace the comet's path back through 10 million years of cosmic history.</p>

<p>Utilizing data from the Gaia mission, the researchers reconstructed the comet's trajectory and identified its likely origin in the galaxy. This analysis has enhanced understanding of interstellar objects and their significance in the study of the universe.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “3I/ATLAS is a cosmic time capsule — a frozen piece of the early Universe preserved for billions of years,” said astronomer Pérez Couto from CITIC.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I/ATLAS, only two interstellar objects had been confirmed: ‘Oumuamua in 2017 and comet 2I/Borisov in 2019. These discoveries have prompted increased interest in the study of interstellar materials and their implications for understanding the formation of stars and planets.</p>

<p>The study of comets like 3I/ATLAS provides a unique opportunity to investigate the chemical makeup of ancient star systems, potentially revealing how the building blocks of life may be found across the galaxy.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze data collected from 3I/ATLAS as it travels through the solar system. The European Space Agency and other institutions are prioritizing the study of interstellar objects to better understand the history and formation of the universe.</p>
