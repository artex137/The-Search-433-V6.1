      <h2>3I/ATLAS Survived Perihelion as Single Body — Harvard's Loeb Questions Its Origin</h2>

<p>An interstellar visitor, Comet 3I/ATLAS, has held together as it passed closest to the Sun on 29 October 2025. This unusual resilience has surprised scientists, prompting new questions about its origins from noted astrophysicist Avi Loeb of Harvard University.</p>

<p>The survival of 3I/ATLAS during its perihelion challenges previous assumptions about the structural integrity of comets. Loeb suggests that the characteristics of 3I/ATLAS may indicate it is not a typical natural comet, sparking renewed debate among researchers about its formation and nature.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS passed perihelion on 29 October 2025.</li>
    <li>Images from the Nordic Optical Telescope were taken on 11 November 2025.</li>
    <li>Observations on 9 November 2029 revealed plumes extending up to one million kilometres towards the Sun.</li>
    <li>The mass flow of the comet is estimated at five billion tonnes each month.</li>
    <li>Loeb calculated that vaporising CO₂ ice requires 3 × 10<sup>18</sup> Joules of energy.</li>
    <li>The estimated surface area necessary for this absorption exceeds 1,600 square kilometres.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS has a maximum diameter of 5.6 kilometres as observed by the Hubble Space Telescope.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 29 October 2025, Comet 3I/ATLAS passed closest to the Sun, an event known as perihelion. Following this, new images were captured on 11 November 2025, revealing that the comet remained intact. On 9 November 2029, further observations showed significant outflow plumes extending in both directions.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "The fact that 3I/ATLAS remains a single body is surprising for a natural comet," highlighting the unusual nature of the interstellar object.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loeb also noted, "This fundamental disparity compels us to reassess the composition and structure of the interstellar visitor."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The survival of comets during close encounters with the Sun is typically rare. Most comets disintegrate due to intense heat and gravitational forces. The case of 3I/ATLAS raises questions about the physical characteristics and potential origins of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Ongoing research will continue to investigate the composition and structure of 3I/ATLAS. Scientists are expected to conduct further observations and analyses to better understand this interstellar object's unique properties and origins.</p>
