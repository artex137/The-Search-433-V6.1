      <h2>3I/ATLAS Radio Signal Detections Offer New Confirmation of What Many Astronomers Have Been Saying for Months</h2>

<p>New radio detections from the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS have confirmed its natural origin, according to the South African Radio Astronomy Observatory. The observations were made on October 24, 2023, using the MeerKAT radio telescope located in the Northern Cape province of South Africa.</p>

<p>This development adds to the growing body of evidence supporting the comet's natural characteristics, amid ongoing discussions about its unusual trajectory. The findings help clarify debates surrounding the object and its possible technological origins, particularly following its non-gravitational acceleration observed during its closest approach to the Sun last month.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Date of observations: October 24, 2023</li>
  <li>Location: MeerKAT radio telescope, Northern Cape, South Africa</li>
  <li>Frequency of hydroxyl absorption detected: 1665 and 1667 MHz</li>
  <li>Previous attempts at detection: September 20 and 28, 2023</li>
  <li>Next significant event: Comet will pass within 53 million kilometers of Jupiter in March 2024</li>
  <li>NASA's Juno spacecraft will attempt further observations during this pass</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On September 20 and 28, 2023, scientists made two attempts to detect radio signals from 3I/ATLAS, but no observable signals were recorded. On October 24, the MeerKAT telescope successfully detected hydroxyl absorption lines associated with the comet, confirming its ongoing sublimation and solar-driven outgassing.</p>

<p>The comet's closest approach to the Sun occurred last month, leading to renewed interest in its behavior and origin. The recent observations provide further evidence that 3I/ATLAS is exhibiting normal cometary activity.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The new MeerKAT data offers the latest reinforcement of the mainstream scientific consensus: 3I/ATLAS is acting like a comet,” said Micah Hanks, Editor-in-Chief and Co-Founder of The Debrief.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has generated interest among astronomers due to its unusual trajectory and characteristics. Hydroxyl radicals, detected through the recent observations, are commonly associated with cometary behavior and are formed when ultraviolet radiation breaks down water vapor released during sublimation. This behavior aligns with what astronomers expect from comets heating up near the Sun.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists plan to continue monitoring 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Jupiter in March 2024. This upcoming pass presents a unique opportunity for further observations, particularly with NASA’s Juno spacecraft aimed at detecting low-frequency radio emissions from the comet.</p>
