      <h2>Top Scientist Jacques Vallée Says UFO Databases Logged 260,000 Sightings and 'Non-Human Creatures'</h2>

<p>Jacques Vallée, a prominent computer scientist and astronomer, has stated that databases linked to a defence intelligence programme have logged approximately 260,000 UFO sightings and hundreds of reports of non-human creatures. Vallée made these claims in a video recorded at the request of filmmaker James Fox, highlighting the significance of this information.</p>

<p>This revelation is significant as it comes from Vallée, who has been involved in UFO investigations for decades and helped develop the data systems used to track these sightings. The implications of his findings may prompt further scrutiny from authorities and the scientific community regarding unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP).</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>260,000</strong> screened UFO sightings logged in defence intelligence databases.</li>
    <li>Reports include hundreds of incidents involving non-human creatures.</li>
    <li>Vallée worked on the data system as a member of a scientific team at Bigelow Aerospace.</li>
    <li>New environmental data collected from historic cases in New Mexico and France.</li>
    <li>Vallée serves on the scientific advisory board of France's national space studies centre.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Several years ago, Jacques Vallée initiated a system of databases used by a Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA) programme at Bigelow Aerospace. Vallée, as a cleared member of a scientific team, contributed to the study of UFO and UAP phenomena.</p>
<p>In a recent video, Vallée revealed the scale of the data warehouse, which contains 260,000 filtered reports of anomalous objects and hundreds of reports about non-human entities. He highlighted significant historical cases, including incidents from 1945 in San Antonio, New Mexico, and the 1965 Valensole case in France, which remain officially unidentified.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The value of the system lay in its multinational and historical scope,” Vallée said, emphasizing the importance of comparing modern cases with older incidents across different countries.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Data segmentation has held research back for decades,” Vallée stated, advocating for executive action to relax classification rules.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Vallée's claims shed light on the ongoing interest and investigation into UFO phenomena, particularly as governments around the world become more transparent about their findings. His references to specific historical incidents underscore the belief that tangible evidence may exist, despite official classifications preventing wider access to this information.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Vallée's statements may prompt calls for further investigation and potential declassification of related documents. The scientific community and authorities may need to reconsider their approach to studying unidentified aerial phenomena in light of this new information.</p>
