      <h2>George H. W. Bush 'Knew' Humans Made Contact With Aliens in 1964, Bombshell New Documentary Claims</h2>

<p>A new documentary titled <em>The Age of Disclosure</em> alleges that former U.S. President George H. W. Bush was informed about human contact with aliens as early as 1964. The film premiered on Amazon Prime on November 21 and features astrophysicist Eric Davis, who claims Bush shared this information during a conversation in 2003, a decade after his presidency.</p>

<p>The documentary raises significant questions about government transparency regarding unidentified flying objects (UFOs) and extraterrestrial life. It claims that a top-secret operation known as "The Legacy Program" has been retrieving UFOs for approximately 80 years, with involvement from various government agencies, including the CIA and the U.S. Air Force.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Documentary premiered on November 21, 2023.</li>
    <li>Eric Davis, a former advisor on the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP), makes claims about Bush.</li>
    <li>Incident reportedly occurred at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico in 1964.</li>
    <li>Three spaceships were allegedly seen approaching the base.</li>
    <li>Bush was informed of an alien encounter after his presidency in 2003.</li>
    <li>Hal Puthoff, another AATIP member, claims multiple types of extraterrestrial beings exist.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 1964, three spaceships reportedly approached Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico. According to Eric Davis, an alien emerged from one of the crafts and interacted with military and CIA officials. This information allegedly reached George H. W. Bush, who was told he did not have a "need-to-know" during his presidency from 1989 to 1993. In 2003, a decade after leaving office, Bush confided in Davis about the encounter.</p>

<p>The documentary discusses "The Legacy Program," which is said to have been operational for around 80 years and is involved in UFO retrieval. Hal Puthoff, another contributor, mentions that not all recovered alien bodies are the same type, suggesting a variety of extraterrestrial beings.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "One of them landed on the tarmac and a non-human entity deboarded the craft that landed and interacted with uniformed Air Force and civilian CIA personnel," Eric Davis stated.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "I think that there’s this assumption that presidents can walk into the Oval Office on day one and say: 'Alright, take me to Roswell, show me the alien bodies...'" said Marco Rubio, U.S. Secretary of State.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This documentary adds to a growing body of evidence and claims regarding UFOs and government secrecy. Previous incidents, including the alleged UFO crash in Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947, have fueled public interest and speculation about extraterrestrial life. The Legacy Program, as described in the documentary, suggests that information about UFOs has been withheld from U.S. presidents over the years.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>It remains unclear what further investigations or official responses may arise from the documentary's claims. The discussion around UFOs and government transparency continues to evolve, with potential implications for future policies and public understanding of extraterrestrial encounters.</p>
