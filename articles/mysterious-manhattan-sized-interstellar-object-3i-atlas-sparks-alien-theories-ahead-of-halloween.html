      <h2>Mysterious Manhattan-Sized Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS Sparks Alien Theories Ahead of Halloween</h2>

<p>3I/ATLAS, the third known interstellar object, has been observed since July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile. This enormous comet, measuring approximately 3 to 5 miles across, has captured the attention of astronomers and sparked speculation about its potential origins.</p>

<p>The significance of 3I/ATLAS lies in its unusual size and hyperbolic orbit, which indicates it has come from outside the Solar System. NASA and various international missions are currently monitoring the object, which will pass closest to the Sun on October 30, 2025, at a distance just inside Mars's orbit.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Location of Discovery:</strong> ATLAS survey telescope, Chile</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to the Sun:</strong> October 30, 2025, at ~1.4 AU (130 million miles)</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to Earth:</strong> ~1.8 AU (170 million miles)</li>
    <li><strong>Estimated Mass:</strong> ~33 billion tons</li>
    <li><strong>Size:</strong> Nucleus up to ~3.5 miles (5.6 km) across</li>
    <li><strong>Speed upon Entry:</strong> ~61 km/s (137,000 mph)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile. Following its discovery, archived images confirmed its hyperbolic trajectory, indicating it did not originate in the Solar System. NASA has classified it as the third interstellar visitor, following 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019.</p>
<p>The comet is expected to reach perihelion on October 30, 2025, and will continue to be visible through September 2025. After passing the Sun, it will cross near Jupiter's orbit by March 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “3I/ATLAS is behaving like a normal comet and poses no threat to Earth,” said NASA scientists. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “No one knows where the comet came from. It’s like glimpsing a rifle bullet for a thousandth of a second. You can’t project that back with any accuracy,” stated David Jewitt, leader of the Hubble team.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to the discovery of 3I/ATLAS, the only known interstellar objects were 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov. The study of these objects has opened new avenues for understanding the composition of celestial bodies beyond our Solar System.</p>
<p>Despite some speculation about its origins, most astronomers agree that 3I/ATLAS behaves like a typical comet, containing water ice and a high proportion of carbon dioxide.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches perihelion, NASA and other space agencies will continue to monitor its trajectory and composition. Future observations are planned, particularly as it passes near Mars and Jupiter, providing opportunities to study this interstellar comet from various angles.</p>
