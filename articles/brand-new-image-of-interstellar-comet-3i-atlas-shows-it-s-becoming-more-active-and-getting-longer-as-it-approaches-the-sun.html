      <h2>Brand new image of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS shows it's becoming more active and getting longer as it approaches the Sun</h2>

<p>A new image of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has revealed increased activity and a longer tail as it approaches the Sun. The image was captured on 27 August 2025 by astronomers and students using the Gemini South telescope at Cerro Pachón in Chile. No injuries or fatalities have been reported related to this astronomical event.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it enhances understanding of the comet's composition and behavior as it travels through the inner Solar System. Authorities involved in the observation, including the University of Hawai‘i Institute for Astronomy and NSF NOIRLab, have emphasized the importance of public engagement in scientific research.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on 1 July 2025.</li>
    <li>It is only the third known comet to originate from beyond our Solar System.</li>
    <li>The image was captured using the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS).</li>
    <li>The public outreach initiative involved students from Hawai‘i and La Serena, Chile, and participants from Europe, New Zealand, and South America.</li>
    <li>The program was led by Karen Meech, an astronomer at the University of Hawai‘i Institute for Astronomy.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first discovered by the ATLAS survey telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile, on 1 July 2025. Since then, it has been observed by various powerful telescopes, including the Very Large Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope. The latest image was captured on 27 August 2025, showing notable changes in the comet's tail and coma as it approaches the Sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "The primary objectives of the observations were to look at the colours of the comet, which provide clues to the composition and sizes of the dust particles in the coma, and to take spectra for a direct measure of the chemistry," said Karen Meech.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "As 3I/ATLAS speeds back into the depths of interstellar space, this image is both a scientific milestone and a source of wonder," Meech added. "It reminds us that our Solar System is just one part of a vast and dynamic galaxy — and that even the most fleeting visitors can leave a lasting impact."
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable for being the third comet identified as originating from outside the Solar System. Its observations have provided valuable insights into the similarities between comets from different origins, suggesting shared formation processes. This information is crucial for cometary scientists studying the evolution of comets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey, it is expected to make close passes of the Sun, Earth, Mars, and Jupiter. Observations will continue, providing further data on its trajectory and chemical composition as it becomes visible to rovers and orbiters at Mars and Jupiter over the coming months.</p>
