      <h2>UFO researcher claims Pope is ‘preparing’ for first contact with aliens this year</h2>

<p>A British filmmaker has suggested that the Vatican may be preparing for a potential encounter with extraterrestrial beings, with the Pope possibly addressing humanity's "first contact" with aliens within the next year. UFO investigator Mark Christopher Lee has claimed he obtained "rare access" to the Vatican's private archives to examine historical records of unexplained events related to potential interactions with alien life forms.</p>

<p>This assertion raises questions about the Catholic Church's stance on extraterrestrial life and its implications for faith. Authorities within the Vatican have not confirmed these claims but have a history of discussing the compatibility of belief in extraterrestrial beings with Christian doctrine.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Mark Christopher Lee has gained access to the Vatican's private archives.</li>
    <li>Lee is examining historical records for insights into alien interactions.</li>
    <li>The Pope could potentially address first contact within the next year.</li>
    <li>In 2008, Father Gabriel Funes stated that intelligent beings could exist elsewhere in the universe.</li>
    <li>Pope Leo XIV's astronomer is prepared to baptize an alien.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Mark Christopher Lee has recently gained access to the Vatican's private archives and started his research into unexplained phenomena. He has expressed his belief that the Catholic Church is considering the implications of discovering extraterrestrial life. In 2008, Father Gabriel Funes proposed that such beings could exist, and more recently, Father Richard D'Souza indicated that theology may need to adapt if contact with intelligent life occurs.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "I've been given rare access to the Vatican's secret archives. I'll be looking for any historical references to unexplained phenomena, spiritual encounters, or anything that could shed light on humanity's possible contact with intelligent life beyond Earth." 
    — Mark Christopher Lee
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "They are all part of God's creation. The question would be how to reach them or how they would reach us." 
    — Father Richard D'Souza
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Vatican has a history of discussing the existence of extraterrestrial life. Father Gabriel Funes has previously written that the existence of intelligent beings made by God elsewhere in the universe does not conflict with Christian beliefs. This perspective suggests an openness within the Church to the idea of life beyond Earth.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Mark Christopher Lee plans to continue his research into the Vatican's archives, aiming to uncover how prepared the Catholic Church is for potential contact with extraterrestrial beings.</p>
