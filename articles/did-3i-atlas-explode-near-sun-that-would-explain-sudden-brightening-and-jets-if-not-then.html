      <h2>Did 3I/ATLAS explode near Sun? That would explain sudden brightening and jets. If not, then...</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS may have exploded near the Sun, according to observations that show sudden brightening and jets emanating from the object. The brightening occurred during its perihelion, leading to speculation about its composition and behavior. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with this astronomical event.</p>

<p>This development matters because it raises questions about the nature of 3I/ATLAS and its potential origins. Harvard scientist Avi Loeb has suggested that if the comet did not explode, it could imply it is an unnatural object. Authorities and scientists are monitoring the situation closely, with ongoing observations expected to clarify the comet's behavior as it approaches Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS brightened significantly at perihelion, losing mass at an unprecedented rate.</li>
    <li>According to the Webb telescope, the comet lost 150 kilograms of mass per second on August 6, 2025.</li>
    <li>Current observations indicate a mass loss of about 2 million kilograms per second.</li>
    <li>Recent images show jets shooting out in at least seven directions.</li>
    <li>Michael Buechner and Frank Niebling reported that sunward jets measure 0.95 million kilometres, while the tail jet is approximately 2.85 million kilometres long.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is estimated to have a mass of 33 billion tons.</li>
    <li>More detailed observations are expected by late November and early December.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On August 6, 2025, 3I/ATLAS exhibited a mass loss of 150 kilograms per second, as recorded by the Webb telescope. Following this, the comet was observed to have an extraordinary mass loss rate at perihelion, approximately 2 million kilograms per second. Recent photographs captured strange jets emerging from the comet in multiple directions.</p>
<p>As the comet continues its approach towards Earth, scientists anticipate clearer observations by late November and early December, when it will be closer to our planet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "Since the surface-to-mass ratio scales inversely with the characteristic radius of fragments, an increase in surface area by a minimum factor of 16 requires that 3I/ATLAS broke into at least 16 equal pieces, and likely many more."</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loeb further expressed concern, saying, “Houston, we have a problem” if the natural comet hypothesis holds true.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to this event, 3I/ATLAS was noted for its unusual characteristics, including a mass significantly greater than 1I/`Oumuamua. The discovery of jets and the sudden brightening have drawn comparisons to the comet Shoemaker-Levi 9, which fragmented after being disrupted by Jupiter's gravity in 1994.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth. Further investigations will focus on the nature of the jets and the potential implications of its mass loss. More definitive data is expected to emerge by early December, aiding in the understanding of this interstellar object.</p>
