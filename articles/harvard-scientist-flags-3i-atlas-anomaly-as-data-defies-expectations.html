      <h2>Harvard Scientist Flags 3I/ATLAS Anomaly as Data Defies Expectations</h2>

<p>A leading astrophysicist from Harvard has raised concerns about the unusual behaviour of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, stating that new data challenges existing models. Professor Avi Loeb, head of Harvard's Institute for Theory and Computation, made his remarks following observations of the object during its perihelion on 29 October 2025, about 1.36 AU from the Sun, approximately 203 million kilometres away.</p>

<p>This revelation is significant as it suggests that the object is exhibiting non-gravitational acceleration, which could have implications for our understanding of physics. Authorities, including NASA, are closely monitoring 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth, with plans to collect more data during its closest fly-by on 19 December 2025.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Perihelion date: 29 October 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from the Sun at perihelion: 1.36 AU (approximately 203 million kilometres)</li>
    <li>Observed acceleration: 135 km day<sup>-2</sup> radially; 60 km day<sup>-2</sup> transversely</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: 19 December 2025</li>
    <li>Key researcher: Professor Avi Loeb, Harvard University</li>
    <li>NASA report by engineer: Davide Farnocchia</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 29 October 2025, 3I/ATLAS reaches perihelion and displays anomalous acceleration. This observation is documented in a report by NASA engineer Davide Farnocchia. Following this, Professor Loeb raises concerns about the object's behaviour, suggesting it may not conform to known physical principles.</p>

<p>In early November 2025, instruments such as ESA's Juice spacecraft are expected to detect potential gas plumes from the object. The Hubble and James Webb space telescopes will then observe 3I/ATLAS during its closest approach to Earth on 19 December 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It is a bad professional practice for theoretical astrophysicists to conclude that the data must be wrong just because they do not have a theoretical explanation for it,” said Professor Loeb during a recent address to young astrophysicists at Harvard.</blockquote>

<blockquote>NASA planetary scientist Tom Statler stated, “3I/ATLAS looks like a comet in just about every way. Most astronomers prefer compositional or structural explanations over technological ones.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object to visit our solar system. Previous objects, such as 'Oumuamua, have sparked similar debates regarding their origins and characteristics. Loeb's previous work on 'Oumuamua suggested it could have been an alien probe, a claim that remains controversial within the scientific community.</p>

<p>The ongoing discussion about 3I/ATLAS reflects a broader trend in astronomy, where unexplained phenomena challenge existing theories and encourage open inquiry.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey, astronomers worldwide are preparing to gather more data during its December fly-by. The results could provide insight into the object's composition and behaviour, helping to clarify whether its acceleration is due to natural processes or something more extraordinary.</p>
