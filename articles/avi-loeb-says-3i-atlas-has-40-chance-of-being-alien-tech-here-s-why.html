      <h2>Avi Loeb Says 3I/ATLAS Has 40% Chance of Being Alien Tech—Here's Why</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist Dr. Avi Loeb has asserted that the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has a 40% chance of being alien technology, raising significant interest within the scientific community. Loeb's claim comes as 3I/ATLAS approaches its perihelion, the closest point to the Sun, expected around 29 October 2023. This assertion has sparked debate as the object will be obscured from Earth-based telescopes due to the Sun's glare.</p>

<p>This matter is critical as it challenges the prevailing view of 3I/ATLAS as a natural comet. Authorities and scientists are now closely monitoring the object for any changes in trajectory or behaviour that could support Loeb's claims. The scientific community remains divided, with many insisting 3I/ATLAS is merely a strange comet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Size:</strong> Approximately 5.6 kilometres wide</li>
    <li><strong>Expected Perihelion:</strong> 29 October 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Chance of Being Alien Tech:</strong> 40% according to Dr. Avi Loeb</li>
    <li><strong>Observation Tools Used:</strong> James Webb and SPHEREx telescopes</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Dr. Avi Loeb has publicly stated the 40% probability of 3I/ATLAS being alien technology based on a series of anomalies observed in the object. These anomalies include its unusual chemical composition, a gas plume with a high carbon dioxide content, and a trajectory aligned with the ecliptic plane.</p>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches its perihelion, it will be obscured by the Sun, leading to heightened scrutiny of its behaviour and trajectory. Loeb has suggested that this timing might facilitate a technological manoeuvre that would be hidden from view.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“There is only one place where that is known to exist and that is in industrially produced nickel alloys,” Loeb stated, referring to 3I/ATLAS's unique chemical signature.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“If its composition is not found in nature, it must, by definition, be artificial,” Loeb added, emphasizing the implications of the object's anomalies.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The scientific community has largely classified 3I/ATLAS as a natural comet, despite its peculiar characteristics. Loeb's arguments have introduced a new perspective, suggesting that the object's properties could indicate artificial origins. This is not the first time an astronomical object has sparked debate regarding its nature, but the stakes are perceived to be higher given the possibility of contact with extraterrestrial technology.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches its closest point to the Sun, scientists will monitor for any changes in its trajectory or velocity. Any significant alterations could substantiate Loeb's claims and lead to further investigation into the nature of the object.</p>
