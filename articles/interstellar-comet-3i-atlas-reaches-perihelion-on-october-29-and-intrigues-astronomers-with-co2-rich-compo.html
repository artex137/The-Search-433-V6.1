      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS reaches perihelion on October 29</h2>

<p>Nasa has confirmed the perihelion of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which is set to occur on October 29, 2025, as the comet approaches the Sun at a distance of 210 million kilometers. The comet, detected on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile, is the third interstellar object recorded to pass through the Solar System.</p>

<p>This event is significant for astronomers as 3I/ATLAS, traveling at a speed of 209,000 kilometers per hour, exhibits intense activity with jets of dust and gas forming a tail approximately 10,000 kilometers long. Its carbon dioxide-rich composition challenges existing cometary formation models and suggests origins from distant cold regions. NASA has activated observation protocols to analyze the comet's evolution during its passage.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS detected on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile.</li>
  <li>Perihelion occurs on October 29, 2025, at a distance of 210 million kilometers from the Sun.</li>
  <li>Comet travels at a speed of 209,000 km/h.</li>
  <li>Comet displays a tail approximately 10,000 kilometers long.</li>
  <li>Initial detection by ATLAS confirmed the comet's activity on July 2, 2025.</li>
  <li>Observations from the Hubble Telescope indicate a nucleus diameter ranging from 300 meters to 11 kilometers.</li>
  <li>Dust production rate estimated at 30 kg per second in July 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was initially detected on July 1, 2025, with confirmation of its activity on July 2. Telescopes in Chile and Spain captured images revealing a diffuse coma. Preliminary studies indicated heightened carbon dioxide levels, challenging traditional cometary models.</p>
<p>The comet passed near Mars on October 3, 2025, at a distance of 28 million kilometers, observed by the Trace Gas Orbiter and Perseverance probes. As it approaches perihelion, NASA coordinates with the International Asteroid Warning Network for continuous monitoring.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
  “The atypical composition reinforces studies on galactic evolution,” said Tom Statler, chief scientist at NASA. “We emphasize that there are no risks associated with this comet, and our focus remains on scientific advances.”
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The designation "3I" marks this comet as the third confirmed interstellar object, following 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Its hyperbolic orbit confirms its trajectory external to the Solar System, with entry recorded in May 2025. Observations from NASA's TESS satellite detected early activity during this phase.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>After perihelion in October, 3I/ATLAS will cross Jupiter's orbit and become unobservable from ground telescopes in December 2025. NASA and ESA's Juice probe are set to conduct further observations, while data from this event will contribute to global catalogs of interstellar objects.</p>
