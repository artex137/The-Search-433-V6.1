      <p class="byline">Published 2025-12-13 04:39 UTC</p>

      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS shows a growing green glow as its chemistry evolves</h2>

<p>Recent observations have revealed that interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is exhibiting a faint green glow as it moves through the Solar System, with scientists monitoring its changes and chemical activity. The updates were provided by teams from the European Space Agency (ESA), NASA, and the Gemini North Observatory around mid-December 2025.</p>

<p>This observation is significant because 3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object recorded in our Solar System, following 1I/‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Scientists are using various telescopes to study the comet's behavior while they still have the opportunity, as it will not return once it leaves the Solar System.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS entered the Solar System from interstellar space.</li>
    <li>It was observed emitting X-rays for the first time on December 3, 2025.</li>
    <li>The latest images showing a green glow were taken on November 26, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet is currently about 280 million kilometers away from Earth.</li>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is shedding gas and dust as it moves away from the Sun.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 26, 2025, images captured by the Gemini North telescope in Hawai‘i showed the comet with a diffused green light around its coma. This observation occurred shortly after the comet became visible again following its passage behind the Sun.</p>

<p>On December 3, 2025, ESA's XMM-Newton space telescope detected 3I/ATLAS in X-rays for the first time, observing it for nearly 20 hours. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the comet's composition and behavior.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This type of green emission is commonly seen in many comets,” said a researcher from the Gemini Observatory, referring to the observed green glow from diatomic carbon, or C₂.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“No single telescope can tell the whole story,” a NASA spokesperson noted, emphasizing the importance of combining different observational methods.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“This is a rare chance to study material from another star system before it is gone,” stated an ESA scientist regarding the limited observing window for 3I/ATLAS.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is unique as it is not bound by the Sun's gravity and is not formed within the Solar System. Its behavior and chemical changes differ from typical comets, making it an important subject for scientific study. The green glow suggests active gas release, which is a key indicator of the comet's chemical evolution.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it moves outward from the Sun. Ongoing observations will focus on its chemical composition and behavior, providing valuable insights before the comet leaves the Solar System.</p>
