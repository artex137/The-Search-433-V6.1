      <h2>NASA's 'Training Exercise' Over 3I/ATLAS Sparks Fear of Hidden Interstellar Threat</h2>

<p>NASA has launched a global training exercise focusing on the unpredictable comet 3I/ATLAS, prompting concerns about an undisclosed threat, according to reports from various sources. The initiative, which aims to improve the tracking of this dynamic celestial body, has raised alarms among some astronomers and online communities regarding the true nature of the exercise.</p>

<p>The International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) has organized this campaign to enhance the capabilities of astronomers worldwide in accurately tracking comets. The urgency surrounding this training has led to speculation that it may be a response to a real threat rather than a routine scientific exercise. The situation is compounded by unusual reports related to the comet, including claims of engine-like sounds and warnings from prominent astrophysicists.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet:</strong> 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1)</li>
    <li><strong>Training registration deadline:</strong> November 7, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Workshop date:</strong> November 10, 2025, at 15:00 UTC</li>
    <li><strong>Campaign kick-off:</strong> November 25, 2025, at 15:00 UTC</li>
    <li><strong>Observing window opens:</strong> November 27, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Observing window closes:</strong> January 27, 2026</li>
    <li><strong>Close-out teleconference:</strong> February 3, 2026, at 15:00 UTC</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The IAWN has provided a structured timeline for the training exercise:</p>
<ul>
    <li>November 10, 2025: Comet Campaign Workshop at 15:00 UTC.</li>
    <li>November 25, 2025: Campaign kick-off at 15:00 UTC.</li>
    <li>November 27, 2025: Observing window opens.</li>
    <li>December 9, 2025: Mid-campaign check-in teleconference at 15:00 UTC.</li>
    <li>January 27, 2026: Observing window closes.</li>
    <li>February 3, 2026: Close-out teleconference at 15:00 UTC.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The primary goal of the campaign is to introduce methods for improving astrometry from comet observations,” said an IAWN spokesperson.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “Only those participants that attend the workshop can participate in the campaign,” the organization stated, noting the mandatory nature of the training.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This training exercise comes amid a backdrop of unusual reports regarding 3I/ATLAS. Claims from a purported ESA whistleblower have suggested that the comet may produce engine-like sounds, while a Harvard astrophysicist has warned that the discovery could 'change everything.' Such statements have fueled public speculation about the real purpose of the IAWN campaign.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The IAWN's campaign aims to refine techniques for tracking comets and improve global planetary defence capabilities. As astronomers prepare for the mandatory training, the scientific community and the public remain watchful for any developments regarding the comet and its implications.</p>
