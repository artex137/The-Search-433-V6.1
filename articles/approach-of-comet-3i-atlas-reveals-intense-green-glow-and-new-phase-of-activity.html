      <h2>Approach of Comet 3I/ATLAS Reveals Intense Green Glow and New Phase of Activity</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has displayed an intense green glow as it approaches Earth, reaching its closest point on December 19, 2025, at a distance of approximately 270 million kilometers. Observations confirm this celestial body is in a phase of heightened activity following its perihelion, which occurred in October 2025.</p>

<p>This event is significant for astronomers worldwide, who are closely monitoring the comet's behavior to enhance understanding of its chemical composition and origins from outside the Solar System. The vibrant green hue of the comet is attributed to diatomic carbon molecules, which are excited by solar radiation, indicating a vigorous sublimation of ices in its core.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date of closest approach:</strong> December 19, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Earth:</strong> 270 million kilometers (approximately 1.8 astronomical units)</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Over 200,000 kilometers per hour</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery:</strong> July 2025 by the ATLAS research system</li>
    <li><strong>Previous color:</strong> Predominantly reddish in August 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Current activity:</strong> Increased brightness and gas release</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025. Observations in August revealed a reddish color, indicating a dust-dominated coma. Following its perihelion in October, the comet underwent a significant transformation, displaying a green hue due to the release of diatomic carbon.</p>
<p>On November 26, 2025, the Gemini North telescope confirmed the comet's active state and the presence of a greenish glow. The comet is expected to reach its closest proximity to Earth on December 19, 2025, before continuing its journey into interstellar space.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "The vibrant green hue observed in comet 3I/ATLAS’ coma is a direct result of the abundant presence of diatomic carbon, known as C2," said an astronomer involved in the observations.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "The heating caused by solar radiation induces the direct sublimation of the ices present in the comet’s nucleus," the astronomer added.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object, following 'Oumuamua and Borisov. Its icy nucleus and active state are significant for studying the composition of comets from outside the Solar System. Previous observations of comets have shown similar behavior when heated by the Sun, leading to changes in brightness and color.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to observe 3I/ATLAS as it moves further from the Sun and into interstellar space. They anticipate potential additional bursts of material as the comet cools and reacts to solar heat, providing further insights into its characteristics and behavior.</p>
