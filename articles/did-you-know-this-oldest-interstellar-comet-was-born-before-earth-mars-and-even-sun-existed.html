      <h2>Did You Know? This Oldest Interstellar Comet Was Born Before Earth, Mars And Even Sun Existed</h2>

<p>NASA scientists have confirmed that interstellar comet 3I ATLAS, now passing through our solar system, is approximately seven billion years old, making it older than the Sun itself. The comet was discovered on July 1, 2025, by NASA’s Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System telescope in Chile.</p>

<p>This discovery matters because it offers a rare opportunity to study pre-planetary material from another star system. Comet 3I ATLAS has shown active water sublimation and unusual behavior, prompting further investigation by astronomers and scientists worldwide.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovered:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Location of discovery:</strong> Chile</li>
    <li><strong>Estimated age:</strong> 7 billion years</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to Earth:</strong> December 19, 2025, at approximately 270 million kilometers</li>
    <li><strong>Water loss:</strong> About 40 kilograms per second</li>
    <li><strong>Observation facilities:</strong> Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, Sabadell Observatory (Spain), Lowell Observatory (Arizona)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, NASA’s Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System telescope discovered comet 3I ATLAS in Chile. The comet has since been confirmed to originate from outside our solar system, indicating a hyperbolic trajectory. In early November 2025, the comet reappeared from behind the Sun with a bright green coma, but its tail was not visible due to its alignment away from Earth.</p>

<p>Subsequent observations revealed that the tail was still present but oriented such that it could not be seen from our planet. The green hue observed is attributed to diatomic carbon C₂ molecules reacting with ultraviolet radiation from the Sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This object behaves like a cosmic time capsule carrying pristine material from before our Sun was born,” said Dr. Zexi Xing, lead scientist from Auburn University.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The Sun's UV rays are effectively burning the comet's surface, giving it that eerie emerald color,” said astronomer Qicheng Zhang.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I ATLAS is the third known interstellar visitor to travel through our solar system, following ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Its unique characteristics have sparked speculation regarding its origin, with some scientists suggesting an artificial origin. However, NASA and ESA maintain that 3I ATLAS is a natural remnant of another star system's formation process.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Skywatchers can expect to see 3I ATLAS in the eastern pre-dawn sky through November and December 2025, particularly near Venus and the bright star Spica in the constellation Virgo. Observations will continue as scientists study this ancient traveler and its implications for our understanding of the solar system's history.</p>
