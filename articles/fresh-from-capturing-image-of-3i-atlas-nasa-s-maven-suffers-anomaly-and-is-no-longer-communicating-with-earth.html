      <h2>Fresh From Capturing Image Of 3I/ATLAS, NASA's MAVEN Suffers "Anomaly" And Is No Longer Communicating With Earth</h2>

<p>NASA's Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) orbiter has lost communication with Earth following an unknown "anomaly" that disrupted contact with NASA’s Deep Space Network. The loss of signal occurred on December 6, 2023, but no injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This incident is significant as MAVEN has played a crucial role in studying Mars's atmosphere and has recently made important discoveries, including the detection of "sputtering" in the Martian atmosphere. NASA is currently investigating the anomaly and has not disclosed specific details about the situation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>MAVEN launched in November 2013 and entered Mars's orbit in September 2014.</li>
    <li>The spacecraft lost communication with NASA on December 6, 2023.</li>
    <li>MAVEN had recently captured an image of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS.</li>
    <li>The orbiter's mission was extended until September 2025.</li>
    <li>NASA’s Deep Space Network is responsible for communicating with interplanetary missions.</li>
    <li>Telemetry indicated all subsystems were functioning normally before the loss of signal.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>MAVEN was launched in November 2013 and successfully entered Mars's orbit in September 2014. For over a decade, it has provided valuable data on the Martian atmosphere. On December 6, 2023, the orbiter lost communication with Earth after an anomaly occurred, following a period where all systems appeared to be functioning normally. NASA has initiated an investigation into the loss of signal.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Telemetry from MAVEN had showed all subsystems working normally before it orbited behind the Red Planet. After the spacecraft emerged from behind Mars, NASA’s Deep Space Network did not observe a signal,” NASA said in a statement this week.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The MAVEN team has a strong record of innovation in addressing engineering challenges to extend the mission and add capability,” MAVEN Project Manager Rich Burns at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center said in 2022.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>NASA has experienced communication losses with interplanetary probes in the past, including a brief loss of contact with Voyager 2 in 2023, which was resolved shortly after. Such occurrences are not uncommon in deep space missions, and NASA typically finds ways to reestablish communication with its spacecraft.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA is currently investigating the anomaly affecting MAVEN and will provide updates as more information becomes available. The spacecraft remains an important asset for ongoing research about Mars.</p>
