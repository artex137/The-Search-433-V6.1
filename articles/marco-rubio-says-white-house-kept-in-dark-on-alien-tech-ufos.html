      <h2>Marco Rubio Says White House Kept In Dark On Alien Tech, UFOs</h2>

<p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio has revealed that rogue government elements have concealed information about alien contact from U.S. presidents for decades. This disclosure occurred in a new documentary titled <em>The Age of Disclosure</em>, which will stream on Prime Video beginning November 21.</p>

<p>This revelation raises significant concerns about national security and transparency regarding unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs). Authorities are now scrutinizing decades of secrecy surrounding government projects related to UFOs and their potential implications for military operations.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Documentary titled <em>The Age of Disclosure</em> to stream on Prime Video starting November 21.</li>
    <li>Marco Rubio is 54 years old and serves as the U.S. Secretary of State.</li>
    <li>Over 1,600 sightings of UAPs logged by the Pentagon's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office in the last four years.</li>
    <li>Congress has held three public hearings on UFOs since 2022, featuring testimonies from military whistleblowers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In recent years, the U.S. government has shifted towards greater transparency regarding UFOs, moving away from decades of secrecy. Rubio's comments in the documentary highlight the extent of this concealment. The Pentagon has documented over 1,600 UAP sightings since the establishment of its All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office.</p>

<p>Since 2022, Congress has conducted three public hearings, showcasing testimonies from military personnel about encounters with unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We've had repeated instances of something operating in the airspace over restricted nuclear facilities – and it's not ours,” Rubio said.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“This was pretty shocking to hear someone of Rubio's level making that allegation,” said Dan Farah, producer and director of the documentary.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“For someone of Rubio's level to make that accusation in public with such certainty says a lot about what's been kept secret for decades from everyone – and, apparently, even the president,” stated Dr. Bill Birnes, author of <em>UFOs and the White House</em>.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The U.S. government's recent openness about UFOs marks a significant departure from a long history of secrecy and cover-ups. The emergence of the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office and the increase in public hearings signal a shift towards accountability in addressing UAP sightings.</p>

<p>Military sources have reported that many UFOs exhibit behaviors that defy the laws of physics, raising questions about their origin and intent.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>In light of these revelations, investigations into past government projects related to UFOs are expected to intensify. The implications of Rubio's claims may lead to further inquiries about national security and military readiness regarding unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>
