      <h2>French astronomer claims to work on comet 3I/ATLAS from 230 million miles away</h2>

<p>Laura-May Abron, a French-American astronomer, has stated that she works on comet 3I/ATLAS, which is currently 230 million miles from Earth. Abron made the claim in a Reddit post shared on r/Astronomy, where she detailed her observations and imaging of the comet using a medium-sized telescope.</p>

<p>The announcement has sparked interest in the scientific community, as 3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object to be observed in our solar system. Astronomers are encouraged to track and analyze the comet while it is still visible, according to Abron.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Earth:</strong> 230 million miles</li>
    <li><strong>Astronomer:</strong> Laura-May Abron</li>
    <li><strong>Telescope Used:</strong> Vaonis Vespera II-X and a 22-inch Dobsonian telescope</li>
    <li><strong>Location of Observations:</strong> Southern California</li>
    <li><strong>Observation Technique:</strong> Stacked 300 individual 10-second exposures</li>
    <li><strong>Brightness:</strong> Brighter than previous interstellar visitors, 'Oumuamua and Borisov</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Since its discovery, comet 3I/ATLAS has generated various theories and speculation regarding its origin. Laura-May Abron has shared her observations through social media, specifically on Reddit, where she encouraged others to engage in observing the comet. She utilized advanced techniques to capture images of the comet, demonstrating the capabilities of modern astronomical practices.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “I work on comet 3I/ATLAS, which I recently imaged with a Vaonis and observed through a medium-sized telescope,” Laura-May Abron stated in her Reddit post.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “Reach out to your local astronomical society if you don't have a big scope,” Abron advised fellow astronomy enthusiasts.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable for being the third confirmed interstellar object observed in our solar system. Its origin outside the Sun’s gravitational influence has attracted both scientific interest and public speculation. Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has contributed to discussions about such phenomena, fostering public fascination with interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Abron’s observations will continue as long as conditions allow. Astronomers and enthusiasts are encouraged to utilize similar techniques for tracking and imaging the comet while it remains visible. Further collaboration with professional observatories, including recent runs at Gemini Observatory, may enhance understanding of comet 3I/ATLAS.</p>
