      <h2>Comet 3I/Atlas to Pass Near Earth on December 19</h2>
<p>On December 19, the comet designated 3I/Atlas will pass approximately 270 million kilometers from Earth, according to NASA. This distance is nearly 700 times the average distance between Earth and the Moon. There have been no reports of injuries or fatalities associated with this event.</p>

<p>This pass offers a significant opportunity for astronomers to study the comet's composition using powerful telescopes. Although the comet will not be visible to the naked eye, various online resources will allow interested observers to track its trajectory in real time.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event Date: December 19</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth: Approximately 270 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Visibility: Not visible to the naked eye</li>
    <li>Tracking Resources: The Sky Live and 3Iatlaslive</li>
    <li>Live Broadcasts: Available on YouTube</li>
    <li>Data Source: NASA's Eyes on the Solar System project</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/Atlas has been consistently observed as it travels through the solar system. Astronomers have noted its stable behavior, which suggests that it will continue on its current path without significant changes leading up to its December 19 pass.</p>
<p>As the date approaches, various platforms will provide updates on the comet's position and trajectory, ensuring that interested observers can prepare accordingly.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The comet has exhibited consistent behavior thus far, suggesting that this trend will continue as it travels through the solar system,” NASA officials stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This event is part of a series of notable celestial occurrences that have captured the interest of both professional and amateur astronomers. The use of advanced tracking tools and public engagement through live broadcasts has become increasingly common in the field of astronomy.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As December 19 approaches, astronomers and interested observers will continue to monitor the comet's trajectory through available online resources. Live simulations and updates will remain accessible to the public, facilitating engagement despite the ongoing U.S. government shutdown.</p>
