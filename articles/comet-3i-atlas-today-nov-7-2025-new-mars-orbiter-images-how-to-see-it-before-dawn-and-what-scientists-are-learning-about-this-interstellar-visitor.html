      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Observed Again as It Re-emerges from Behind the Sun</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has re-emerged from behind the Sun and is now visible to astronomers in the pre-dawn sky, according to updates from multiple space agencies on November 7, 2025. The comet, also known as C/2025 N1 [ATLAS], poses no threat to Earth as it travels on a hyperbolic trajectory at roughly 210,000 km/h.</p>

<p>Authorities are mobilizing to study 3I/ATLAS, the third confirmed interstellar object ever seen. New images from the Tianwen-1 Mars orbiter and tracking tools for the public have been released, enhancing efforts to understand the comet's composition and behavior after its closest approach to the Sun on October 29, 2025.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Perihelion:</strong> October 29, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to Earth:</strong> December 19, 2025, at approximately 270 million km</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> 210,000 km/h</li>
    <li><strong>Observational Tools:</strong> JPL Horizons, TheSkyLive, NASA’s Eyes on the Solar System</li>
    <li><strong>Latest Imagery:</strong> Captured by Tianwen-1 and ESA’s ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey in Chile. It was confirmed as an interstellar object shortly after. The comet passed approximately 30 million km from Mars on October 3, 2025, during which ESA’s ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter and Mars Express attempted to capture images. Following its perihelion on October 29, it was hidden from Earth’s view. As of early November, the comet has become observable again in the pre-dawn sky.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS is a natural, CO₂-rich interstellar comet that just rounded the Sun,” said a representative from ESA. “New imagery and tracking tools make it easier than ever to follow this interstellar visitor.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object confirmed by scientists, following 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. The study of such objects provides insights into the formation and evolution of planetary systems outside our own.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As observations continue, scientists expect to analyze more calibrated results in the coming weeks. The ESA's JUICE spacecraft plans to collect data in November, with results anticipated on Earth in early 2026.</p>
