      <h2>Remembering that time a jet disappeared chasing a UFO over Lake Superior</h2>

<p>On November 23, 1953, an interceptor jet piloted by Felix Moncla disappeared while pursuing an unidentified flying object over Lake Superior, near the Soo Locks. The aircraft, which had radar operator Robert L. Wilson on board, has never been recovered, and its disappearance remains a mystery.</p>

<p>The incident, known as the Kinross Incident, has garnered attention over the years, particularly as interest in Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs) has grown. Authorities from both the United States and Canada have conducted investigations into the case, but no definitive answers have emerged about the fate of the aircraft or its crew.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of incident: November 23, 1953</li>
    <li>Location: Over Lake Superior, near the Soo Locks</li>
    <li>Pilot: Felix Moncla</li>
    <li>Radar operator: Robert L. Wilson</li>
    <li>Speed of pursuit: Up to 800 km/h (500 mph)</li>
    <li>Search efforts: Conducted by the U.S. and Canadian Air Forces</li>
    <li>Status: Aircraft and occupants never found</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On the evening of November 23, radar operators at Sault Ste. Marie detected an unknown object in restricted airspace. An F-89C interceptor took off from Kincheloe Air Force Base to investigate the object, which was reportedly changing course and difficult to track. For approximately 30 minutes, Moncla pursued the object at high speeds.</p>

<p>As the two blips on the radar screen representing the jet and the unknown object merged, they were approximately 70 miles off the Keweenaw Peninsula. Shortly after merging, the blip representing the jet vanished from the radar, and attempts to contact Moncla were unsuccessful.</p>

<p>A search and rescue operation by U.S. and Canadian Air Forces began but yielded no results. The U.S. Air Force later suggested that the jet crashed while pursuing a Canadian aircraft that had strayed off course, a claim denied by the Royal Canadian Air Force.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Moncla’s gravestone states he disappeared ‘intercepting a UFO over Canadian Border,’” according to reports on the incident.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Kinross Incident is part of a broader history of UFO sightings in Michigan, particularly during the 1960s. The term Unidentified Flying Object has since evolved into Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena, reflecting a shift in how these incidents are discussed and investigated.</p>

<p>In recent years, interest in UAPs has surged, leading to increased scrutiny of past incidents and calls for transparency from governmental agencies regarding their findings.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the Kinross Incident remain open, and organizations like the Open Skies Project continue to explore theories surrounding the disappearance while working to preserve historical sites related to the event.</p>
