      <h2>Non-Gravitational Acceleration of Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS Explained In New Study</h2>

<p>A new study has explained the non-gravitational acceleration of comet 3I/ATLAS, our third confirmed interstellar visitor, which was first spotted on July 1, 2025, as it passed through the Solar System. The findings aim to eliminate the need for "non-natural hypotheses" regarding the comet's behavior.</p>

<p>This research is significant as it provides a conventional explanation for the comet's acceleration, which has previously raised questions among astronomers. The study, conducted by Florian Neukart of the Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science, suggests that ordinary outgassing of volatiles could account for the changes in velocity observed in 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first observed on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Non-gravitational acceleration measured at perihelion distance of 1.36 astronomical units (203 million kilometers).</li>
    <li>Radial acceleration of 135 kilometers per day squared.</li>
    <li>Transverse acceleration of 60 kilometers per day squared.</li>
    <li>Detection of hydroxyl (OH) molecules on October 24, indicating water release.</li>
    <li>Paper authored by Florian Neukart has not yet been peer-reviewed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers detected comet 3I/ATLAS on an escape trajectory through the Solar System. Observations confirmed its classification as an interstellar comet, exhibiting typical cometary behavior, including a nucleus, coma, and tails.</p>
<p>During its approach to the Sun, signs of non-gravitational acceleration were noted. A preprint paper by Neukart, published recently, proposes that this acceleration can be explained by conventional outgassing of volatiles.</p>
<p>On October 24, 2025, the MeerKAT radio telescope detected hydroxyl (OH) molecules in the comet's atmosphere, indicating that it is currently releasing water.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Our results show that a conventional volatile-driven mechanism reproduces both the magnitude and the direction of the acceleration for realistic active fractions and jet collimation,” Neukart explained in the paper.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“These results eliminate the need for non-physical or exotic explanations and define thermophysical limits for natural acceleration mechanisms in interstellar comets,” Neukart added.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“This means that the comet is currently releasing water, which is expected for a comet that just passed its closest passage to the Sun,” Dr. Cyrielle Opitom stated regarding the detection of hydroxyl molecules.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable as it is the third confirmed interstellar object to visit our Solar System. Previous interstellar objects have raised questions about their origins and behavior, leading to various hypotheses, some of which have been deemed non-natural or exotic.</p>
<p>The findings in Neukart's study aim to clarify these questions by providing a more conventional explanation for the comet's acceleration, potentially impacting future research on interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further observations of 3I/ATLAS are necessary to test the proposed model of acceleration and to gather more data as the comet becomes more visible to optical telescopes. Researchers are expected to continue monitoring its behavior in the coming weeks.</p>
