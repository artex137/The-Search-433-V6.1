      <h2>What Would Happen If 3I/ATLAS Hits Earth? Experts Say Impact Would Be Catastrophic</h2>

<p>Astronomers and space agencies worldwide are monitoring 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar object discovered on 1 July 2025 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope in Chile. NASA has confirmed that 3I/ATLAS poses no immediate threat to Earth, but concerns have arisen regarding its unusual trajectory and behaviour. Scientists are investigating potential consequences of a hypothetical impact scenario.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as it highlights the importance of preparedness for cosmic threats. Although 3I/ATLAS is not currently on a collision course, its inclusion on the global planetary-defence monitoring list indicates that researchers are using it to test responses to future threats.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> 1 July 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to Earth:</strong> Approximately 1.8 astronomical units (≈ 270 million km)</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Point to the Sun:</strong> Scheduled for 30 October 2025 at about 1.4 AU (≈ 210 million km)</li>
    <li><strong>Size:</strong> Diameter estimated between 440 metres and 5.6 kilometres</li>
    <li><strong>Classification:</strong> Comet, not an asteroid</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on 1 July 2025 by the ATLAS telescope in Chile. NASA confirmed its trajectory and behaviour, indicating no collision risk. The object will reach its closest point to the Sun on 30 October 2025, at a distance of approximately 1.4 AU from the Sun.</p>

<p>Despite the lack of immediate danger, its unique characteristics have prompted scientists to assess potential impacts if it were on a collision course with Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Current data show no collision risk,” NASA stated regarding 3I/ATLAS.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The consequences of a large object striking Earth would be severe,” according to WION.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is classified as a comet due to its activity and outgassing, which distinguishes it from asteroids. This classification is important for understanding its composition and behaviour, which may offer insights into other star systems.</p>

<p>While 3I/ATLAS is not a threat, its study enhances our knowledge of cosmic risks and aids in developing early-warning systems for potential future impacts.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and other space agencies will continue to observe 3I/ATLAS to refine their impact prediction models and improve planetary defence strategies. Although there are no immediate threats, ongoing research will help prepare for any future cosmic risks.</p>
