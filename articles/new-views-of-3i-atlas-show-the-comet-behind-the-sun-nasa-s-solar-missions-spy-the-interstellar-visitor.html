      <h2>New views of 3I/ATLAS show the comet behind the Sun. NASA's solar missions spy the interstellar visitor</h2>

<p>NASA's solar-observing spacecraft have captured images of comet 3I/ATLAS as it passed behind the Sun from Earth's perspective in October 2025. The interstellar comet, formed about 7 billion years ago, is currently traveling through our Solar System and has recently reemerged into view as of late November 2025.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as astronomers race to gather information about 3I/ATLAS before it exits the Solar System. NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) have utilized various missions to enhance their understanding of the comet's properties and trajectory during this unique opportunity.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS passed behind the Sun in October 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet formed approximately 7 billion years ago.</li>
    <li>NASA’s STEREO observed the comet from 11 September to 2 October 2025.</li>
    <li>ESA’s Trace Gas Orbiter has captured images to help recalculate the comet's trajectory.</li>
    <li>PUNCH tracked the comet from 28 September to 10 October 2025.</li>
    <li>SOHO observed 3I/ATLAS from 15 to 26 October 2025.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was observed at distances exceeding 358 million km (222 million miles) from Earth.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>NASA’s STEREO mission began observing comet 3I/ATLAS from 11 September to 2 October 2025. STEREO utilized a stacking imaging technique to enhance visibility, capturing the comet as a hazy white blob against the background. Following this, ESA’s PUNCH spacecraft tracked the comet from 28 September to 10 October 2025, successfully capturing its tail despite its faintness.</p>

<p>The Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) observed 3I/ATLAS from 15 to 26 October 2025. SOHO, which has a history of spotting comets, managed to view the comet from over twice the distance between Earth and the Sun. These observations have provided valuable data about the comet’s size and composition.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We’re really pushing the limits of the system,” said Kevin Walsh of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, who led PUNCH’s observations of the comet.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interstellar comets like 3I/ATLAS offer scientists a rare opportunity to study celestial bodies formed around distant stars. The ongoing observations from multiple space missions highlight the advancements in imaging techniques that allow for better visibility of such faint objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As comet 3I/ATLAS continues its journey through the Solar System, scientists will analyze the data collected from these observations to enhance their understanding of the comet's properties and trajectory. Further updates on the comet's visibility and characteristics are expected as it moves closer to its exit from the Solar System.</p>
