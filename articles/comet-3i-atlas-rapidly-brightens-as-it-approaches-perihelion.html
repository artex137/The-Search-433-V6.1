      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Rapidly Brightens as It Approaches Perihelion</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has rapidly brightened as it approaches perihelion, scheduled for October 29. Observations indicate that the comet is currently detectable, with no injuries or fatalities reported.</p>

<p>This brightening is significant as it marks the comet’s closest approach to the sun. Researchers and amateur astronomers are utilizing spacecraft data to track its path. Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third recorded interstellar comet, providing valuable insights into the origins and characteristics of such celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Perihelion scheduled for October 29, 2023</li>
    <li>Brightness reported at magnitude 11 on October 18</li>
    <li>Estimated brightness may reach magnitude 9 at perihelion</li>
    <li>Traveling at speeds exceeding 130,000 mph (210,000 km/h)</li>
    <li>Estimated maximum width of about 3.5 miles (5.6 kilometers)</li>
    <li>First discovered in July 2023</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has been under observation since its discovery in July 2023. On October 18, amateur astronomer Worachate Boonplod reported the comet's brightness and visibility using NOAA's GOES-19 weather satellite. Other missions, including NASA's PUNCH and the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), have joined in monitoring efforts. Findings regarding the comet's rapid brightening were published on arXiv on October 28, just before its perihelion.</p>

<blockquote>“The comet appears notably bluer than the sun, supporting theories that gas emissions have significantly contributed to its brightness,” researchers stated in their findings.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable for being the third known interstellar comet to traverse the solar system. Its speed surpasses that of any previously recorded solar system object, hinting at an extensive journey potentially spanning billions of years. Some astronomers suggest it could be one of the oldest comets observed, estimated to be around 3 billion years older than the solar system itself.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA anticipates that Comet 3I/ATLAS will become observable from Earth again by early December 2023. It may also be visible to spacecraft orbiting Jupiter during its close approach in March 2026.</p>
