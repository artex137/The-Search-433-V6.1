      <h2>Double cosmic treat: 2 dazzling comets set to swing by Earth this month</h2>

<p>Sky-watchers can look forward to two comets making their closest approaches to Earth this month. Comet C/2025 A6 Lemmon and Comet C/2025 R2 SWAN will both be visible in October, providing a rare celestial display for observers.</p>

<p>This event matters as it offers a unique opportunity to see ancient travelers from the solar system’s outskirts. Astronomers, including Quanzhi Ye from the University of Maryland, have highlighted the brief visibility of these comets due to their long, oval-shaped orbits.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet SWAN will pass closest to Earth on October 20, at a distance of 24 million miles (38.6 million km).</li>
    <li>Comet Lemmon will follow on October 21, at a distance of 55 million miles (88.5 million km).</li>
    <li>Comet SWAN was discovered on September 10; Comet Lemmon was spotted on January 3.</li>
    <li>SWAN is best seen shortly after sunset; Lemmon is best visible just before sunrise.</li>
    <li>SWAN will fade soon after its closest approach, while Lemmon is expected to brighten through early November.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet C/2025 R2 SWAN was discovered on September 10, 2023, during its close approach to the sun. Comet C/2025 A6 Lemmon was spotted earlier on January 3, 2023. Both comets will make their closest approaches to Earth on October 20 and 21, respectively.</p>

<p>On October 6, the Virtual Telescope Project captured an image of Comet SWAN, showcasing its characteristic green gas and trailing tail. As the month progresses, both comets will be visible in the night sky.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “SWAN is best seen in early evening shortly after sunset,” explained Quanzhi Ye, associate research scientist at the University of Maryland’s astronomy department, in an email.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “It was too faint and distant initially to show the dramatic tails visible now,” said Carson Fuls, director of the Catalina Sky Survey, regarding the discovery of Lemmon.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comets like SWAN and Lemmon are long-period comets, with orbits that span 200 years or more. They likely originated near giant planets like Jupiter before being nudged into the distant Oort Cloud, where they have remained frozen for billions of years. These comets contain organic compounds that provide insights into the early solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Observers should take advantage of the brief visibility of these comets in October. After their closest approaches, Comet SWAN will fade quickly, while Comet Lemmon is expected to remain visible for a longer period before disappearing behind the sun.</p>
