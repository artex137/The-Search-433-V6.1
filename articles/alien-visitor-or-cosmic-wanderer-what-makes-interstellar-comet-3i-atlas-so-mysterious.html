      <h2>Alien visitor or cosmic wanderer? What makes interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS so mysterious</h2>

<p>China's Tianwen 1 Mars probe has captured images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS during its close pass by Mars from October 1 to October 4, 2025. The China National Space Administration (CNSA) has released these images, marking a significant milestone in planetary science.</p>

<p>This event is important as it offers a rare glimpse of a celestial body that originated beyond our solar system. The encounter has attracted global attention, prompting NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) to redirect their Mars missions to observe the comet. Researchers aim to gather data that could provide insights into the comet's composition and trajectory.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS approached Mars between October 1 and 4, 2025.</li>
    <li>The images were taken from a distance of nearly 29 million kilometres.</li>
    <li>The comet is the third confirmed interstellar object to pass through our solar system.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS has displayed unusual behaviour, including unexpected acceleration.</li>
    <li>It is composed of approximately 4% water by mass.</li>
    <li>The mission is part of Tianwen 1’s extended operations, serving as a test for future deep-space missions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 1, 2025, Tianwen 1 began capturing images of comet 3I/ATLAS. The imaging continued until October 4, during which the spacecraft utilized its High-Resolution Imaging Camera (HiRIC) to photograph the comet. CNSA reported that the data collected revealed a clear view of the comet's bright nucleus and its vast coma.</p>
<p>The mission has been acknowledged as a significant technical test ahead of the upcoming Tianwen 2 asteroid-sampling mission, showcasing the spacecraft's ability to detect and image faint celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This experiment demonstrated the spacecraft’s capability to detect and image faint, fast-moving celestial bodies,” said a representative from CNSA.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“While 3I/ATLAS is most likely natural, exploring remote possibilities of artificial origin remains a scientifically interesting exercise,” stated Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object to visit our solar system, following ‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. The comet's peculiarities, including its chemical composition and acceleration, have spurred scientific inquiry into the nature of interstellar objects.</p>
<p>The temporary delay of NASA's high-resolution images from its Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, due to a US government shutdown, has sparked discussions about transparency in space exploration. NASA has emphasized that the comet poses no threat to Earth.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As comet 3I/ATLAS continues its journey into deep space, scientists will analyze the data collected from various missions. The findings may provide new insights into the composition and structure of interstellar objects.</p>
