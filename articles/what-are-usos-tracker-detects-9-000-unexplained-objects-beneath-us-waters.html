      <h2>What Are USOs? Tracker Detects 9,000 Unexplained Objects Beneath US Waters</h2>

<p>A notable increase in underwater anomalies has emerged along U.S. coastlines, with the tracking app Enigma recording more than 9,000 sightings of Unidentified Submersible Objects (USOs) since its launch in late 2022. These sightings have raised concerns among defence officials, as they describe mysterious glowing objects appearing and disappearing in U.S. waters. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>The significance of these findings has prompted authorities to consider the implications for national security. Enigma claims to have logged over 30,000 unexplained events, with a growing number of reports detailing objects hovering above or plunging into the water. Experts are calling for further investigation into these phenomena, suggesting they could involve advanced military technology or unknown natural occurrences.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Enigma has recorded over 9,000 USO sightings within 16 kilometres of U.S. shorelines.</li>
    <li>California leads with 389 reports, followed by Florida with 306.</li>
    <li>More than 150 reports describe objects hovering or submerging in water.</li>
    <li>Enigma claims to have logged over 30,000 unexplained events since late 2022.</li>
    <li>Retired U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Tim Gallaudet has warned about the implications for national security.</li>
    <li>Gallaudet testified before the U.S. House Oversight Committee in late 2024.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Since the launch of the Enigma app in late 2022, reports of USOs have surged dramatically. By the end of 2024, over 9,000 sightings have been documented within 10 miles of U.S. coastlines. Retired Rear Admiral Tim Gallaudet has publicly raised concerns about the implications of these sightings for national security, citing a particular incident involving the USS Omaha in 2019.</p>

<p>During this incident, the USS Omaha tracked a spherical object over the Pacific Ocean near San Diego, which then plunged into the ocean without leaving a trace. The Pentagon later verified this footage.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The fact that unidentified objects with unexplainable characteristics are entering U.S. water space and the Department of Defense is not raising a giant red flag is a sign that the government is not sharing all it knows.” 
    — Tim Gallaudet, Retired U.S. Navy Rear Admiral
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “We know more about the surface of Mars than our own deep sea.” 
    — Tim Gallaudet
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>USOs are aquatic counterparts to UFOs and UAPs, defined as any object detected underwater that cannot be identified. Historical sightings have been reported for centuries, with accounts describing objects exhibiting unusual speeds and behaviours. Gallaudet's recent statements have reignited discussions about the need for comprehensive investigations into these phenomena, particularly given their potential ties to military technology.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities are expected to continue monitoring USO sightings and may initiate further investigations into the implications for national security. The growing number of reports has prompted renewed calls for transparency and research into these unexplained phenomena.</p>
