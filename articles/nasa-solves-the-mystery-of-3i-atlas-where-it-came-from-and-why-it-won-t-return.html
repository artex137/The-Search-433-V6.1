      <h2>NASA Solves The Mystery Of 3I/ATLAS: Where It Came From And Why It Won't Return</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet known as 3I/ATLAS has been confirmed as only the third of its kind, detected in early July 2025 by the NASA-funded ATLAS telescope system. Initial analyses have determined that it follows a hyperbolic orbit, indicating it does not belong to the Solar System and is merely passing through.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it helps scientists understand the origins of celestial bodies and provides insights into the formation of planets outside our solar system. NASA has stated that the comet poses no threat to Earth and its trajectory will take it back into interstellar space after its passage through the Solar System.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Detected: Early July 2025</li>
    <li>Origin: Interstellar space, near the constellation Sagittarius</li>
    <li>Comet type: Third confirmed interstellar comet</li>
    <li>Trajectory: Hyperbolic orbit, will not return for at least 80 million years</li>
    <li>Comet composition: Active coma with dust, water vapor, and carbon dioxide</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected by the ATLAS telescope system in early July 2025. Following its detection, NASA conducted initial analyses that confirmed its hyperbolic orbit. Observations from both ground-based and space-based telescopes verified its active coma, ruling out extraordinary scenarios regarding its nature.</p>

<p>Scientists believe that 3I/ATLAS could be an extremely ancient object, formed billions of years ago in another region of the Milky Way. Its unique trajectory means it will not return to the Solar System for at least 80 million years.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS is a remarkable find. Each interstellar object offers valuable information about the composition and formation processes of planets outside our solar system,” said a NASA spokesperson.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I/ATLAS, only two interstellar comets have been confirmed. These objects provide critical insights into the formation of celestial bodies beyond our Solar System, which cannot be obtained through other means. The scientific community has shown great interest in such discoveries as they enhance our understanding of the universe.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>No further observations of 3I/ATLAS are expected, as its trajectory will lead it back into interstellar space, with another close approach not anticipated for at least 80 million years.</p>
