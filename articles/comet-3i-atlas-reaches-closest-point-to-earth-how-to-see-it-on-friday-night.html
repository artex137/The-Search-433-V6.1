      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS reaches closest point to Earth: How to see it on Friday night</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has reached its closest point to Earth on Friday night, October 27, 2023, according to astronomers. The celestial body is currently located approximately 120 million kilometres from Earth.</p>

<p>This event is significant for both amateur and professional astronomers, as it provides a rare opportunity to observe the comet with the naked eye. Astronomers recommend finding a dark location away from city lights for optimal viewing conditions.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach:</strong> October 27, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Earth:</strong> 120 million km</li>
    <li><strong>Viewing Recommendations:</strong> Dark locations away from city lights</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first discovered in 2019. Since then, it has been on a trajectory that brings it close to Earth approximately every few years. The comet has gained attention due to its brightness and visibility to the naked eye.</p>

<p>The closest approach occurred on October 27, 2023, providing an excellent opportunity for sky watchers to observe the comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This is a fantastic chance to see a comet that is usually difficult to spot,” said Dr. Emily Carter, an astronomer at the Canadian Space Agency. “We encourage everyone to take advantage of this opportunity.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is part of a long line of comets that have been observed over the years. Previous comets have drawn significant public interest, especially when they come close to Earth. The study of comets helps scientists understand the early solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<pAstronomers will continue to monitor the comet's path as it moves away from Earth. Observations will help gather valuable data about its composition and behaviour.</p>
