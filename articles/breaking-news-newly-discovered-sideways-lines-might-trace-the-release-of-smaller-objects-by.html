      <h2>Newly-Discovered Sideways Lines Might Trace the Release of Smaller Objects by Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>A new image of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has revealed unusual sideways lines extending from it, suggesting the potential release of smaller objects. The image was captured at 4:15 UTC on November 20, 2025, by researchers M. Jäger, G. Rhemann, and E. Prosperi. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it raises questions about the nature of the object and its behavior. Scientists are currently analyzing the image to determine whether the lines represent actual jets of gas or dust from the comet, or if they are merely an optical illusion caused by a satellite streak. Further monitoring will help clarify these findings.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Observation time: 4:15 UTC, November 20, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth: 326 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Image dimensions: 16.7 arcminutes, equivalent to 1.6 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Length of sideways jets: Approximately one million kilometers</li>
    <li>Rotation period of 3I/ATLAS: 16.16 hours</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 2, 2025, a HiRISE image captured the initial stages of 3I/ATLAS's breakup. This image showed an X-pattern around the object, indicating potential fragmentation.</p>
<p>On October 29, 2025, 3I/ATLAS reached perihelion, its closest approach to the Sun. This event likely influenced the subsequent release of smaller components.</p>
<p>On November 20, 2025, the new image revealed the sideways lines, prompting further investigation into their origins.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The simplest explanation for these straight and narrow sideways jets is that they are lines highlighting the trail of gas or dust associated with the linear path of small mini-objects that departed from 3I/ATLAS,” said M. Jäger.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “If the mini-objects started their journey near perihelion, they traversed a distance of a million kilometers in 22 days,” noted G. Rhemann.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified as an interstellar object, making its behavior particularly intriguing to scientists. Previous research has shown that comets can break apart due to tidal forces from the Sun, but the exact mechanisms remain under study.</p>
<p>The recent findings add to the growing body of evidence suggesting that 3I/ATLAS may have complex interactions with its environment, which could include the release of materials that provide insight into its composition and origin.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS and analyze the new image to determine the nature of the sideways lines and the objects they may represent. Further observations will help clarify whether these components are natural or technological in origin.</p>
