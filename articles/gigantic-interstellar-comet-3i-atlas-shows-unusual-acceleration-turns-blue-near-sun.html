      <h2>Gigantic interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS shows unusual acceleration, turns blue near Sun</h2>

<p>A large comet named 3I/ATLAS has exhibited signs of unusual acceleration and has turned blue as it nears the Sun, according to scientists. The comet, first spotted this summer, made its closest approach to the Sun on October 30, 2025.</p>

<p>This phenomenon is significant as it raises questions about the comet's composition and behavior. NASA and international partners, including the European Space Agency (ESA), are currently monitoring the comet using spacecraft-based instruments, as it is not visible from Earth due to its position behind the Sun. Direct observations from Earth are expected to resume in early December.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first observed in summer 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun occurred on October 30, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet is expected to pass closest to Earth on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>NASA and ESA are monitoring the comet with spacecraft instruments.</li>
    <li>Visibility from Earth is limited as the comet is currently behind the Sun.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected in the summer of 2025. It approached the Sun on October 30, where it exhibited unusual acceleration and a blue hue. As of now, astronomers cannot observe it from Earth, but it is expected to reappear in early December 2025.</p>

<p>ESA's Juice spacecraft is scheduled to observe the comet on November 2 and November 25, 2025, to gather further data.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“For a natural comet, this blue color is very surprising.”</blockquote>
<p>Avi Loeb, astrophysicist at Harvard University, commented on the unusual characteristics of the comet.</p>

<blockquote>“@NASA's observations show that this is the third interstellar comet to pass through our solar system. No aliens. No threat to life here on Earth.”</blockquote>
<p>Sean Duffy, Acting Administrator of NASA, addressed speculation regarding the comet's nature.</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is the third interstellar comet observed in our solar system, following previous discoveries. The unusual characteristics of 3I/ATLAS, particularly its acceleration and color, are prompting increased scientific scrutiny and interest.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS from spacecraft until it becomes visible again in December. Observations during its closest approach to Earth on December 19 will help confirm whether it is a natural comet or an artificial object.</p>
