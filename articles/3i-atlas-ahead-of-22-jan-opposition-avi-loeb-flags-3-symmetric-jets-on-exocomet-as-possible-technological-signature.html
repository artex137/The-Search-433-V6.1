      <h2>3I/ATLAS: Ahead Of 22 Jan Opposition, Avi Loeb Flags 3 Symmetric Jets On Exocomet As Possible Technological Signature</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has identified three symmetric jets on the exocomet 3I/ATLAS, which is currently in the solar system and will exit in a few months. Discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS observatory, 3I/ATLAS is the third recorded interstellar object, following 1I/Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to the comet.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it raises questions about the nature of the jets and whether they may indicate technological activity. Authorities, including astronomers and space agencies, are continuing to gather data from various probes and observatories observing 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS observatory.</li>
    <li>Passed by the Sun on October 27, 2025, during an event known as perihelion.</li>
    <li>Three jets are separated by 120 degrees and extend 25,000 kilometers.</li>
    <li>A fourth anti-tail extends 10 times farther toward the Sun.</li>
    <li>Loeb has documented 18 anomalies in 3I/ATLAS.</li>
    <li>The jet structure wobbles periodically by +/-20 degrees every 7.1 hours.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, marking its entry into the solar system. It passed perihelion on October 27, 2025, during which astronomers began observing jets emanating from the object. In a recent blog post, Loeb reported his findings on the jets and their symmetry, which he has documented in 24 images captured by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope.</p>

<p>Loeb's observations suggest that the jets may behave like beams from a rotating lighthouse, with the rotation axis oriented close to the Sun's direction. His findings have prompted further inquiry into the nature of the jets and their implications for understanding the exocomet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The symmetric 120-degree angular spacing between the 3 mini-jets is astounding! It is hard to imagine such a symmetry in a natural macroscopic object,” said Avi Loeb.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “A key question is: are three symmetric mini-jets the minimum viable configuration of propulsion devices to reorient an object in three-dimensional space?” Loeb added.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS adds to the growing body of knowledge regarding interstellar objects, following the previous discoveries of 1I/Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. The characteristics of 3I/ATLAS, particularly the anomalous properties noted by Loeb, have sparked interest and speculation among scientists about the possibility of technological signatures in space.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches its exit from the solar system, further observations and analyses will be conducted to explore the nature of the jets and their implications. Researchers, including Loeb and his colleagues, are expected to continue investigating the anomalies associated with this exocomet.</p>
