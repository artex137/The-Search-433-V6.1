      <h2>NASA breaks the mystery of 3I/ATLAS: theories about its origin continue</h2>

<p>NASA has announced a live event today at 3:00 p.m. ET to share unprecedented images of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, which has generated numerous theories about its origin since its discovery on July 1, 2025. While the majority of scientists classify it as a comet, some experts, including Harvard University astronomer Avi Loeb, have not ruled out the possibility that it could be a spacecraft or technological apparatus.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it aims to clarify the nature of 3I/ATLAS amid ongoing public speculation. NASA has consistently maintained that 3I/ATLAS is a comet, the third interstellar object discovered by humanity, detected by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS). The agency has encouraged the public to ask questions during the event.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event Date: Today, November 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Event Time: 3:00 p.m. ET</li>
    <li>Discovery Date: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Detection System: Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS)</li>
    <li>Number of known interstellar objects: Three</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope system. Since its discovery, it has sparked widespread debate among scientists regarding its classification.</p>
<p>NASA has consistently referred to the object as a comet, but some experts have challenged this view. In particular, Avi Loeb has presented various anomalies that he believes suggest a technological origin.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb has stated, "The trajectory of 3I/ATLAS was very precise so that it was 'unobservable' from Earth."</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loeb has also remarked, "The nucleus of the supposed comet is a million times more massive than that of the two interstellar objects discovered so far by mankind."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS adds to the growing interest in interstellar objects, particularly following the detection of the 'wow signal' in 1977, which also sparked considerable scientific debate. Theories surrounding the nature of such objects often delve into the realms of both science and science fiction.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA’s live event will provide new images and hopefully address some of the questions surrounding 3I/ATLAS. The agency has invited public inquiries to further engage with the ongoing discussion about the object's origin.</p>
