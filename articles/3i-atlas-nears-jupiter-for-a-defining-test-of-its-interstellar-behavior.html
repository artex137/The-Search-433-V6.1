      <h2>3I/ATLAS Nears Jupiter For a Defining Test of Its Interstellar Behavior</h2>

<p>Interstellar object 3I/ATLAS is approaching its closest encounter with Jupiter, scheduled for March 2026, as scientists prepare to study the effects of the planet’s immense gravitational and magnetic fields on the comet's trajectory and behavior.</p>

<p>This encounter is significant because it may confirm whether 3I/ATLAS adheres to established physics or continues to defy expectations. Researchers from NASA and other space agencies are closely monitoring the object, which has already exhibited unusual features, including persistent jets and a unique sunward anti-tail. Data indicates that 3I/ATLAS will not collide with Jupiter, but its high-speed passage through the planet's gravitational sphere of influence will provide vital insights into its structural integrity and behavior.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Event:</strong> Closest approach of 3I/ATLAS to Jupiter</li>
    <li><strong>Date:</strong> March 2026</li>
    <li><strong>Object:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Agencies Involved:</strong> NASA, Hubble Space Telescope team</li>
    <li><strong>Current Status:</strong> Approaching Jupiter for study</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been under observation since its discovery, revealing various unique characteristics. As it nears Jupiter, scientists anticipate measuring its trajectory alterations and other effects resulting from the planet’s gravity and magnetic field.</p>

<p>In March 2026, 3I/ATLAS will pass through Jupiter’s gravitational field at high speed, allowing researchers to observe any changes in the comet's motion and brightness. This encounter will serve as a critical test of existing comet models.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The value of the encounter lies in precision measurements rather than spectacle,” said astronomers involved in the study. “Even small deviations in motion, rotation, or brightness can carry significant scientific weight.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous encounters with Jupiter have shown that comets often experience altered trajectories and changes in activity levels. These observations are crucial for understanding the internal makeup of such celestial objects. 3I/ATLAS represents an opportunity to test these models in ways that Earth-based experiments cannot replicate.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following the encounter in March 2026, scientists will analyze the data collected to refine their understanding of interstellar objects and improve models predicting the behavior of future celestial visitors.</p>
