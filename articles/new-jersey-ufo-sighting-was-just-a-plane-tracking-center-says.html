      <h2>New Jersey UFO Sighting Was Just A Plane, Tracking Center Says</h2>

<p>ROXBURY TOWNSHIP, N.J. – A UFO sighting reported on December 19 has been confirmed as a misidentified commercial aircraft, according to the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC). The sighting occurred around 5:09 p.m. and lasted approximately 22 seconds, with no injuries or fatalities reported.</p>

<p>This clarification matters as it addresses local curiosity surrounding unidentified flying objects. NUFORC's investigation emphasizes the importance of accurate identification of aerial phenomena, particularly as such sightings can often be attributed to natural or man-made sources.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of sighting: December 19</li>
    <li>Time of sighting: 5:09 p.m.</li>
    <li>Location: Roxbury Township, Morris County, New Jersey</li>
    <li>Duration of sighting: Approximately 22 seconds</li>
    <li>Case number: 194836</li>
    <li>Investigation conclusion: Misidentified commercial aircraft</li>
    <li>NUFORC file closure date: December 29</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On December 19 at 5:09 p.m., a lone witness reported seeing a “bright yellow perfect circle” hovering over Roxbury Township. The witness estimated the object’s size to be around 700 feet and claimed it was about seven miles away.</p>

<p>The sighting lasted roughly 22 seconds before the object disappeared from view. Following the report, NUFORC investigators analyzed the light’s speed and trajectory, concluding it matched that of a high-altitude airliner reflecting sunset glare.</p>

<p>NUFORC classified the case as “Aircraft – Probable” and closed the file on December 29, as no additional witnesses or radar anomalies were reported.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The light’s speed and trajectory matched that of a high-altitude airliner,” said a NUFORC investigator regarding the December sighting.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident highlights a common issue during early dusk hours in winter, when low-angle sunlight can illuminate aircraft at cruising altitude, leading to mistaken reports. Similar incidents have been documented in various regions where environmental conditions create unusual visual effects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<pNo further investigations are planned, as NUFORC has closed the case. The center will continue to monitor and evaluate future reports of unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>
