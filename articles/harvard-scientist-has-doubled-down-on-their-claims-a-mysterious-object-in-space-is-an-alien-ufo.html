      <h2>Harvard scientist claims interstellar object is an alien UFO</h2>

<p>Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist, has reiterated his assertion that a mysterious object in space, designated 3I/Atlas, is an alien UFO rather than a natural phenomenon. The object, which astronomers spotted in July 2025, is currently on a trajectory to fly past Jupiter, Mars, and Venus later this year.</p>

<p>This claim has sparked debate within the scientific community, which largely considers 3I/Atlas to be a comet. Loeb's continued insistence on the object's extraterrestrial origins raises questions about the nature of unidentified flying objects and the potential for alien life beyond Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object 3I/Atlas spotted by astronomers in July 2025.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb claims it is an alien spaceship.</li>
    <li>Most astronomers classify it as a comet.</li>
    <li>3I/Atlas will pass by Jupiter, Mars, and Venus later in 2025.</li>
    <li>Loeb previously speculated about the interstellar object Oumuamua in 2017.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, astronomers identified 3I/Atlas as it approached the solar system. Most of the scientific community has since identified it as a comet. However, Avi Loeb has argued that the light emitted from the object is not merely sunlight but rather light from within an alien spaceship.</p>

<p>This is not Loeb's first controversial claim regarding unidentified flying objects. In 2017, he suggested that Oumuamua could be alien technology due to its unusual trajectory.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The light emanating from the ‘comet’ is not sunlight reflecting off it, but light coming from inside the alien spaceship itself,” said Avi Loeb.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The debate surrounding 3I/Atlas reflects ongoing tensions between mainstream astronomy and researchers who propose more speculative theories about extraterrestrial life. Loeb’s claims have garnered both support and criticism, illustrating the divide in perspectives on unidentified flying objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/Atlas approaches the inner solar system, astronomers will continue to track its trajectory. Further observations may provide more data to clarify its nature and origins, while discussions regarding the possibility of alien life are likely to persist.</p>
