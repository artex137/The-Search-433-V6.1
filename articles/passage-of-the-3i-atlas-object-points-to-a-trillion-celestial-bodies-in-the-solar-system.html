      <p class="byline">Published 2025-12-30 01:56 UTC</p>

      <h2>Passage of the 3I/ATLAS object points to a trillion celestial bodies in the solar system</h2>

<p>The scientific community has confirmed new data about 3I/ATLAS, the third officially recorded interstellar object crossing our solar system. Researchers from Projeto Galileu and Universidade of Harvard analyzed images captured by the Telescópio Espacial Hubble, detailing the nature and trajectory of this cosmic visitor first discovered on July 1, 2025. The findings indicate that this celestial body presents a unique opportunity to study materials formed in other stellar systems.</p>

<p>The passage of 3I/ATLAS is significant as it provides astronomers with a sample of the chemical composition from regions distant from the Via Láctea, aiding the validation of theoretical models regarding planet and comet formation in extrasolar environments. Authorities are now focused on further analysis of the object’s trajectory and composition, which may reshape our understanding of the solar system's dynamics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovery date: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Perihelion: October 29, 2025, at a distance of 203 million kilometers from Sol</li>
    <li>Estimated number of similar bodies in the solar system: up to 1 trillion</li>
    <li>Mass of a 1-kilometer diameter object: approximately 1 billion tons</li>
    <li>Latest image captured: December 28, 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers discovered 3I/ATLAS, marking its entry into the solar system. The object approached its closest point to Sol, known as perihelion, on October 29, 2025. This event allowed scientists to observe its interactions with solar radiation, leading to the release of gases and dust.</p>
<p>The most recent data, including a detailed image captured on December 28, 2025, showed a significant feature known as the "antitail," indicating intense activity as the icy surface of 3I/ATLAS reacted to solar radiation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This discovery reinforces the theory that planetary formation processes are universal,” said a spokesperson from Projeto Galileu. “The detection of 3I/ATLAS is not an isolated event but part of a vast population of interstellar objects.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The detection of interstellar objects has increased due to advances in monitoring technology. 3I/ATLAS joins an exclusive list of confirmed interstellar visitors, including 1I/’Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, which were discovered in 2017 and 2019, respectively. Each of these objects has contributed to a growing understanding of the diversity of celestial bodies in the galaxy.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers are advocating for the establishment of observatories in the northern hemisphere to ensure comprehensive monitoring of interstellar objects. Future projects may include the installation of a 100-meter optical interferometer on the surface of Lua, which could provide unprecedented resolution for studying interstellar visitors.</p>
