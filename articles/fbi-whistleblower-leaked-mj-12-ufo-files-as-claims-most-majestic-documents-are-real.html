      <h2>FBI Whistleblower 'Leaked MJ-12 UFO Files' as Claims Most Majestic Documents Are Real</h2>

<p>A former CIA insider, Scotty Newton Miler, has claimed that the majority of the MJ-12 documents, also known as Majestic-12, are authentic. Miler made this assertion during a recent revelation, stating that these documents, which have been controversial since their emergence in the 1980s, contain credible information regarding extraterrestrial phenomena. The claims have resurfaced following recent declassifications of related documents by the National Archives.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as it could suggest that the U.S. government has engaged in a long-term suppression of information regarding extraterrestrial activity. Authorities, including the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, are currently examining the implications of these claims and the potential for a CIA cover-up.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Scotty Newton Miler, former CIA insider, claims MJ-12 documents are authentic.</li>
    <li>Documents first surfaced in December 1984 with a package received by Jamie Shandera.</li>
    <li>Recently declassified material from the Trump administration has reignited interest in MJ-12.</li>
    <li>Claims include specific files like the A.A.W.S.A.P. B.A.A.S.S. report are legitimate.</li>
    <li>House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform is investigating the claims.</li>
    <li>References within the documents suggest interstellar visitation may date back 12,000 years.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The MJ-12 documents first appeared in mid-December 1984 when Jamie Shandera received an unmarked package containing undeveloped film. The film revealed classified briefing documents related to a government program studying extraterrestrial phenomena. In 1985, Shandera and ufologist William Moore uncovered the 'Cutler-Twining memo' in the National Archives, which supported the authenticity of the initial leak.</p>

<p>Public awareness of the documents increased in 1987 when British ufologist Timothy Good received a copy from an alleged intelligence source. Moore and Shandera later released their findings to the press, despite the skepticism of mainstream sources. The debate over the MJ-12 documents has intensified after President Donald Trump’s Executive Order 14176 led to the declassification of related documents in January 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“These papers were intended strictly for high-level SCI-F access and were never meant for public consumption,” said Miler, asserting that there was a deliberate suppression campaign by the CIA.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Dr. James Lakatski, who accessed the original S.A.P. documents, confirmed that the 'Kona Blue' report referred to historical events, supporting Miler's claims.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The MJ-12 documents have faced skepticism since their emergence, with mainstream agencies such as the FBI and the Air Force labeling them as fakes. However, the recent corroboration from credible insiders like Miler indicates that these denials may have been part of a broader disinformation strategy.</p>

<p>If Miler's claims are validated, they could challenge prevailing narratives about government transparency and the history of extraterrestrial encounters.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform are ongoing, focusing on the implications of Miler's assertions and the potential for further declassifications of related documents.</p>
