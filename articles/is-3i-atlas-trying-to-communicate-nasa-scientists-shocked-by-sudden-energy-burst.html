      <h2>Is 3I/ATLAS Trying to Communicate? NASA Scientists Shocked by Sudden Energy Burst</h2>

<p>Astronomers have raised concerns after interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS entered the Solar System, releasing an unprecedented surge of energy and gas. The comet, travelling at over <strong>200,000 km/h</strong>, was first discovered on <strong>July 1, 2025</strong>, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) survey. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to the comet's activity.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as 3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar visitor to the Solar System, following ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. NASA and the James Webb Space Telescope have indicated that the comet’s composition could provide insights into planet formation around distant stars. The comet is expected to reach its closest point to the Sun, or perihelion, on <strong>October 29</strong>, passing approximately <strong>200 million kilometres</strong> from the Sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered on July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Travelling at over 200,000 km/h (130,000 mph)</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun on October 29, 2025</li>
    <li>Expected to pass 200 million kilometres (126 million miles) from the Sun</li>
    <li>Carbon dioxide-rich emissions detected, unlike any previously studied comet</li>
    <li>Outgassing detected while 6.4 astronomical units (roughly 960 million kilometres) from the Sun</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On <strong>July 1, 2025</strong>, astronomers discovered 3I/ATLAS through the ATLAS survey. Since its discovery, the comet has exhibited unusual activity, including a spike in emissions. As it approaches its perihelion on <strong>October 29</strong>, observations have revealed a significant increase in gas and dust output, as well as a high ratio of carbon dioxide to water vapour. The comet's early outgassing activity has prompted scientific inquiry into its characteristics and origins.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Even comets in our solar system can brighten suddenly if a pocket of ice sublimates and drives off dust,” a NASA spokesperson said, dismissing claims of alien origin.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb noted that the unusual light emissions “deserve further scrutiny” because “natural explanations are not yet fully satisfactory.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object to pass through the Solar System. The first was ʻOumuamua, which captured significant attention in 2017 due to its peculiar shape and trajectory. The second, 2I/Borisov, was observed in 2019 and provided valuable data about interstellar comets. The study of such objects helps scientists understand the formation and chemistry of planetary systems beyond our own.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS nears perihelion, telescopes on Earth and in space will continue to monitor its activity. Researchers expect that the comet will become more active, providing opportunities for further exploration and analysis of its emissions. This ongoing investigation may yield insights into the composition of interstellar materials and the processes that govern the formation of celestial bodies.</p>
