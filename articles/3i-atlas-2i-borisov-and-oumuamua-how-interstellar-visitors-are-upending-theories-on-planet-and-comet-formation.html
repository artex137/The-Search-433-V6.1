      <h2>3I/ATLAS, 2I/Borisov and Oumuamua: How interstellar visitors are upending theories on planet and comet formation</h2>

<p>Three interstellar objects, 3I/ATLAS, 2I/Borisov, and 'Oumuamua, have changed scientists' understanding of comet and planet formation since their discoveries. 'Oumuamua was first spotted in 2017, followed by 2I/Borisov in 2019, and most recently, 3I/ATLAS was officially identified on July 1, 2023, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) station in Chile. No injuries or fatalities have been reported related to these celestial bodies.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it challenges existing theories about the formation of comets and planets. Scientists are examining the unique characteristics of each object, which differ greatly from one another, to gain insights into their origins and implications for our understanding of the universe.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>3I/ATLAS</strong> officially spotted on July 1, 2023</li>
    <li>Identified by the <strong>Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System</strong> station in Chile</li>
    <li><strong>2I/Borisov</strong> discovered in 2019, confirmed as a rogue comet</li>
    <li><strong>'Oumuamua</strong> discovered in 2017, first confirmed interstellar object</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is estimated to be <strong>7 to 14 billion years old</strong></li>
    <li>2I/Borisov has a tail <strong>14 times the size of Earth</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>'Oumuamua was the first of the three interstellar visitors, arriving in 2017. It was a rocky object with a cigar-like shape and did not exhibit a coma or tail. In 2019, 2I/Borisov entered the solar system, initially thought to be from within it but later confirmed as an interstellar body. Most recently, 3I/ATLAS was spotted on July 1, 2023, with a trajectory indicating it originated from outside the solar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Each one is rewriting what we thought we knew about how planets and comets form around stars,” said Zexi Xing, a postdoctoral researcher at Auburn University in Alabama.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The arrival of these interstellar objects has prompted scientists to reconsider their existing models of comet and planet formation. Each object presents unique characteristics that differ significantly from typical comets and celestial bodies found within the solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to study the properties and origins of 3I/ATLAS, 2I/Borisov, and 'Oumuamua to further understand their implications for the formation of celestial bodies in the Milky Way.</p>
