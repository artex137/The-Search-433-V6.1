      <h2>Interstellar object 3I/ATLAS to be tracked by Mars, Jupiter probes this month</h2>

<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS is expected to come within 18 million miles of Mars on October 3, 2023. Detected in July by an ATLAS telescope in Chile, the object is being monitored by two Mars orbiters, ExoMars and Mars Express, as scientists seek to understand its nature.</p>

<p>This tracking opportunity is significant as it allows scientists to gather real-time data on 3I/ATLAS using spacecraft designed for Mars and Jupiter. The scientific community is divided on whether 3I/ATLAS is a comet or an alien spacecraft. The observations will help clarify its origin and characteristics, while ground-based telescopes will continue to track 3I/ATLAS until September 2025.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is expected to approach Mars on October 3, 2023.</li>
    <li>It was first detected in July 2023 by an ATLAS telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>The closest distance between the spacecraft and 3I/ATLAS will be 30 million km on October 3.</li>
    <li>The object is travelling at a velocity of approximately 130,000 mph.</li>
    <li>Observations will continue until September 2025, after which the object will be obscured by the sun.</li>
    <li>ESA's Jupiter Ice Moons Explorer (Juice) will observe 3I/ATLAS between November 2 and 25, 2023.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was detected in July 2023 by an ATLAS telescope in Chile. It is expected to pass close to Mars on October 3, 2023. Between October 1 and 7, the Mars orbiters will track the object. Following this, ESA's Juice probe will begin observations in early November.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Between 1 and 7 October, our Mars orbiters Mars Express and ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter will observe the comet as it passes close to Mars, with the closest distance between the spacecraft and the comet being 30 million km on 3 October,” said the European Space Agency (ESA) in a statement.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“JUICE will be in the best position for the important period around the 3I/ATLAS perihelion, when observations from Earth will be the hardest,” said T. Marshall Eubanks, Chief Scientist at Space Initiatives Inc.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object to enter our solar system, following 1I/'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Its unusual trajectory and high velocity have drawn significant interest from the scientific community, prompting efforts to study its characteristics.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to observe 3I/ATLAS to gather data on its composition and trajectory. The Mars orbiters will complete their observations by October 7, while Juice will provide additional insights in November.</p>
