      <h2>3I/Atlas: The Mysterious Comet That 'Went Dark'</h2>

<p>In July 2025, scientists confirmed that a mysterious object designated 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1 ATLAS) is an interstellar visitor entering our Solar System. The object, discovered by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope in Río Hurtado, Chile, is notable for its unusual behaviour, prompting some to speculate it could be an alien spacecraft.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it marks only the third interstellar object ever identified, following 1I/'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Authorities continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun, with observations ongoing from various observatories.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> 1 July 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Discovered by:</strong> Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS)</li>
    <li><strong>Location of Discovery:</strong> Río Hurtado, Chile</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Approximately 60 km/s relative to the Sun</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to the Sun:</strong> Late October 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Next Major Event:</strong> Passes Jupiter in March 2026</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected on 1 July 2025. Follow-up observations confirmed its hyperbolic trajectory, indicating it originated from outside the solar system. As it nears the Sun, its tail and coma have grown, consistent with typical comet behaviour. Observations have indicated that the nucleus may be no larger than 5.6 km across.</p>

<p>As the object approaches the Sun, it is expected to temporarily disappear from view due to solar glare, a phase referred to as 'going dark.' This has led to speculation regarding its movements during this period.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The comet is on course to pass behind the Sun in late October, and venture past Jupiter in March 2026, on its way out of our solar system.” - NASA</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object catalogued, following 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. While some scientists, including astrophysicist Avi Loeb, have suggested the possibility of technological origins for the comet, NASA has dismissed this notion, stating there is no evidence of artificial structure or controlled thrust.</p>

<p>Despite the lack of concrete evidence, the unusual behaviour of 3I/ATLAS has kept speculation alive among certain commentators.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and other observatories will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun and enters its 'dark' phase. Observations will focus on any changes in behaviour during this time, with no immediate threats anticipated from the comet.</p>
