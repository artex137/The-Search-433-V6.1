      <h2>NASA releases new 3I/ATLAS images showing the comet’s astonishing true nature</h2>

<p>NASA has released new images of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, revealing its complex nature and origins, on November 20, 2025. The images come from a coordinated observation campaign involving multiple spacecraft and telescopes across the solar system.</p>

<p>This release is significant as it provides the clearest view yet of 3I/ATLAS, which has intrigued scientists and the public for weeks. The comet has been linked to mysterious radio signals and unusual behaviour, leading to speculation about its nature. NASA’s findings confirm that 3I/ATLAS is a natural interstellar comet, and they assert that it poses no threat to Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date of image release:</strong> November 20, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to Earth:</strong> December 19, 2025, at approximately 267 million kilometres</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery of the comet:</strong> July 2025, by NASA’s ATLAS survey telescope</li>
    <li><strong>Size estimate:</strong> Nucleus between a few hundred metres and about five kilometres across</li>
    <li><strong>CO₂-to-water ratio:</strong> 7.6 to 1, significantly higher than typical comets</li>
    <li><strong>Radio emissions detected:</strong> Hydroxyl (OH) emissions at 1.665 and 1.667 gigahertz</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025 by NASA’s ATLAS survey telescope. It reached its closest point to the Sun in late October 2025 and is currently moving away from the Sun towards the outer solar system. The latest images, released on November 20, 2025, are the result of a multi-mission observation campaign.</p>

<p>NASA’s multi-lens campaign has involved a dozen spacecraft and telescopes, including the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, MAVEN, SOHO, STEREO, and the James Webb Space Telescope. These instruments have captured various aspects of the comet’s structure and behaviour.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“NASA’s new data turns 3I/ATLAS from a speculative mystery into a scientific treasure,” said a NASA spokesperson. “It offers a rare opportunity to directly sample the building blocks of a different solar system.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object detected in our solar system, following 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Previous observations have suggested that 3I/ATLAS exhibits unusual behaviours compared to typical comets formed in our solar system.</p>

<p>The recent findings clarify the comet's chemical composition and support the understanding that it has been influenced by cosmic radiation over billions of years, which has reshaped its icy surface.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches its closest point to Earth. After December 19, the comet will fade from view and will not return to the inner solar system.</p>
