      <h2>Comet 3I/Atlas has an enlarged tail in new photos from the Virtual Telescope project</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/Atlas has shown an enlarged tail, as recorded by robotic telescopes at Projeto Telescópio Virtual in Italy. Images taken on November 11, 2025, reveal the comet's ionic tail extending 0.7 degrees in a northeasterly direction following its closest approach to the Sun on October 29. There are no reported injuries or fatalities related to this astronomical observation.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it enhances the understanding of comet behavior and composition. Authorities at Projeto Telescópio Virtual are conducting real-time observations and will engage the public through a live stream event scheduled for November 19, 2025. The comet, which poses no risk to Earth, follows a hyperbolic trajectory, indicating its origin outside the Solar System.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas was discovered in July 2025.</li>
    <li>The images were taken on November 11, 2025, after the comet's perihelion on October 29.</li>
    <li>The ionic tail extends 0.7 degrees in a northeasterly direction.</li>
    <li>The comet moves at a speed of 221,000 km/h.</li>
    <li>3I/Atlas is the third interstellar object identified, following Oumuamua and Borisov.</li>
    <li>The live stream event will take place on November 19, 2025, at 1:15 am (Brasília time).</li>
    <li>The core of the comet is estimated to be between 320 meters and 5.6 kilometers in diameter.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/Atlas was discovered in July 2025. Following its perihelion on October 29, 2025, robotic telescopes captured images of the comet's tail on November 11, 2025. The ongoing monitoring of the comet has revealed increased activity and the presence of an antitail, an optical effect commonly observed in comets nearing perihelion.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The sharpness of the photos highlights the comet's increased activity,” said representatives from the Observatório Astronômico Bellatrix.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“This event offers a rare opportunity for astronomy,” noted Gianluca Masi, the initiative leader at Projeto Telescópio Virtual.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas is notable for being older than the Solar System, estimated at about 7.6 billion years. Its composition, rich in carbon dioxide, has been confirmed by data from the James Webb Space Telescope, which indicates eight times more CO₂ than water in the coma. Previous interstellar objects, such as Oumuamua and Borisov, have also intrigued scientists, but 3I/Atlas provides new insights into the formation of distant planetary systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Continuous monitoring of Comet 3I/Atlas will occur through the Rede Internacional of Alerta of Asteroides. A training session from November 2025 to January 2026 will refine orbital measurements to enhance understanding of its trajectory.</p>
