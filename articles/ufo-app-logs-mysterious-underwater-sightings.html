      <h2>UFO App Logs Mysterious Underwater Sightings</h2>

<p>Enigma, a UFO reporting app, has documented over 9,000 sightings along the U.S. East Coast, including reports of unidentified submersible objects (USOs) emerging from bodies of water. As of October 24, 2025, the app has become a repository for these reports, highlighting the phenomenon of USOs and their potential implications for national security.</p>

<p>The significance of these sightings has prompted authorities, including military officials, to take notice. Veteran Navy sonar operator Aaron Amick has reported that rapid-moving contacts often appear on sonar, raising concerns about their nature. Former Naval Rear Admiral Tim Gallaudet has characterized these incidents as a serious national security risk, emphasizing the need for further investigation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Enigma app has logged over 9,000 sightings within 10 miles of U.S. shorelines as of August 2025.</li>
    <li>Approximately 1,500 reports (17%) specifically mention water-related terms.</li>
    <li>Roughly 500 sightings (5.6%) occurred within 5 miles of a coastline.</li>
    <li>More than 150 reports describe objects hovering above or moving to and from bodies of water.</li>
    <li>California (389 reports) and Florida (306 reports) have the highest number of USO sightings.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Reports of USOs date back to the 11th century, with witnesses claiming to have seen fiery objects descending into the sea off the Northumberland coast. In 1825, English naturalist Andrew Bloxam documented a luminous orb rising from the sea while on the HMS Blonde.</p>

<p>Fast forward to modern times, sightings continue. In November 2024, Tim Gallaudet testified before the House Oversight Committee, expressing his concerns regarding the national security implications of these incidents. Recently, Enigma has compiled these reports into a collection to better understand the phenomenon.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“These fast movers are so quick that you can’t measure the speed," said Aaron Amick, a veteran Navy sonar operator.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“I see these objects and incidents as a serious national security risk,” stated Former Naval Rear Admiral Tim Gallaudet during his testimony.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The phenomenon of USOs has been documented throughout history, with reports spanning centuries and cultures. The term USO refers specifically to objects detected underwater that cannot be identified. This has drawn attention from researchers and military personnel alike, with an increasing number of reports in recent years.</p>

<p>Enigma's data reflects a growing interest in these sightings, particularly in coastal states where populations are larger, contributing to the number of reported incidents.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities will continue to investigate the reports logged by Enigma, focusing on the implications for national security and the need for further research into the nature of these underwater phenomena.</p>
