      <h2>3I/ATLAS Interstellar Comet: UN Planetary-Defence Campaign Begins as Mars Data Sharpens Its Path</h2>

<p>On 27 November 2025, the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS reached a significant milestone as the United Nations’ planetary-defence network launched a global drill to monitor its trajectory. New data from spacecraft around Mars has improved the predicted path of the comet by a factor of ten, according to the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN).</p>

<p>This initiative matters because it provides a crucial opportunity for scientists to test their observational capabilities and response strategies for potential future threats. The IAWN has stated that while 3I/ATLAS poses no threat, the campaign will help refine planetary-defence techniques.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> 1 July 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to Earth:</strong> 19 December 2025, approximately 270 million km away</li>
    <li><strong>Campaign Duration:</strong> 27 November 2025 to 27 January 2026</li>
    <li><strong>Estimated Size:</strong> Between 0.3 and 5.6 km across</li>
    <li><strong>Future Close Pass to Jupiter:</strong> 16 March 2026</li>
    <li><strong>Current Location:</strong> Constellation Virgo</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Earth:</strong> Approximately 292 million km (1.95 AU)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on 1 July 2025 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Chile. The comet is on a hyperbolic trajectory, indicating it originated from another star system. On 27 November 2025, the IAWN officially launched the “3I/ATLAS Comet Astrometry Campaign,” an observing exercise designed to test planetary-defence protocols.</p>
<p>In early October 2025, the comet passed 29 million km from Mars, where spacecraft captured images that have since enhanced the accuracy of its predicted path. The campaign will last until 27 January 2026, during which professional and amateur astronomers will collaborate to track the comet’s position.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“While it poses no threat, comet 3I/ATLAS presents a great opportunity to perform an observing exercise due to its prolonged observability from Earth and high interest to the scientific community,” stated the IAWN.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is the eighth official IAWN observing exercise since 2017, coordinated with the Space Mission Planning Advisory Group (SMPAG) and the UN Office for Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA). Previous interstellar objects, such as 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have also been studied, but 3I/ATLAS is unique due to its extended visibility and the use of Mars-based observations to refine its trajectory.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>During the campaign, astronomers will submit precise measurements of 3I/ATLAS’s position. This data will be used to stress-test orbit-calculation software and coordination procedures, simulating a real threat scenario. The campaign will conclude on 27 January 2026, after which further analysis of the comet's trajectory will continue.</p>
