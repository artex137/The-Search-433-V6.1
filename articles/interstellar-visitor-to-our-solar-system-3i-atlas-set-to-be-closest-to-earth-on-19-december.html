      <h2>Interstellar visitor to our solar system, 3I/ATLAS, set to be closest to Earth on 19 December</h2>

<p>An interstellar comet named 3I/ATLAS is set to pass its nearest point to Earth on Friday, 19 December, at an approximate distance of 170 million miles. The comet will be visible through binoculars and telescopes during this event.</p>

<p>This event is significant as 3I/ATLAS is only the third recorded interstellar object to visit our solar system, following 1I/’Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Authorities, including NASA, have provided details on how to view the comet and have addressed speculation surrounding its nature.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of closest approach: 19 December</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth: approximately 170 million miles</li>
    <li>Visibility: best viewed in the east to northeast direction during pre-dawn hours</li>
    <li>Location in the sky: under Regulus, a star in the Leo constellation</li>
    <li>Telescope requirement: aperture of at least 30 centimetres</li>
    <li>Discovered: 1 July through the ATLAS telescope in Chile</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on 1 July through the ATLAS telescope, which is funded by NASA. Since its discovery, the comet has been a topic of interest due to its interstellar origin.</p>
<p>In November, NASA held a press conference to clarify its composition and address speculation about it being an alien spacecraft. NASA officials emphasized that all evidence points to it being a comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “We very much want to find signs of life in the universe," said NASA associate administrator Amit Kshatriya during the briefing. "But 3I/ATLAS is a comet.”
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “This object is a comet," Kshatriya reiterated. "It looks and behaves like a comet, and all evidence points to it being a comet.”
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS joins the ranks of only two other interstellar comets recorded to date: 1I/’Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. The unique nature of such comets has sparked considerable interest in the scientific community, particularly regarding their origins and behavior.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Individuals with telescopes will have the opportunity to observe 3I/ATLAS as it travels through our solar system, providing a chance to witness this rare interstellar visitor firsthand.</p>
