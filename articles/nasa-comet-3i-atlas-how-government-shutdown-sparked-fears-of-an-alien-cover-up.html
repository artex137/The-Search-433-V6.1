      <h2>NASA Comet 3I/ATLAS Sparks Speculation Amid Government Shutdown</h2>

<p>The arrival of comet 3I/ATLAS in the summer of 2025 has generated a mix of scientific interest and social media speculation regarding its origins and nature. Discovered on July 1, 2025, by the NASA-funded ATLAS survey in Chile, the comet is recognized as the third interstellar visitor to enter the solar system, traveling at speeds of 137,000 miles per hour (221,000 km/h).</p>

<p>The significance of this discovery is underscored by the ongoing public fascination and the challenges faced by authorities in managing misinformation. The U.S. government shutdown from October 1 to November 12, 2025, created an information vacuum that fueled conspiracy theories about the comet, with some alleging it was an alien probe. NASA's public affairs offices were silenced during this period, which allowed speculation to proliferate.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered on July 1, 2025, by NASA's ATLAS survey.</li>
    <li>Travels at a speed of 137,000 miles per hour (221,000 km/h).</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth occurred on October 29, 2025.</li>
    <li>U.S. government shutdown lasted from October 1 to November 12, 2025.</li>
    <li>Comet was 18.6 million miles away during its closest approach.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the ATLAS survey in Chile identifies comet 3I/ATLAS. The comet quickly attracts attention due to its speed and interstellar origin. By the latter half of 2025, as it approaches Earth, speculation about its nature intensifies, particularly during the U.S. government shutdown from October 1 to November 12.</p>
<p>During the shutdown, NASA's public affairs operations are halted, preventing timely updates about the comet. This situation allows conspiracy theories to gain traction online, with claims of alien technology linked to the comet's behavior.</p>
<p>On October 29, 2025, 3I/ATLAS reaches its perihelion, exhibiting a striking change in color from deep red to vivid green due to sunlight interactions with its materials.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Fighting misinformation is always an uphill battle, especially when the truth is far less cinematic than the fiction,” said Larry Denneau, the discoverer of 3I/ATLAS.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The reality is far more typical,” confirmed NASA's Nicky Fox during a November briefing, addressing claims of extraterrestrial origins.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS follows previous interstellar visitors, such as 1I/'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Both prior objects prompted significant scientific interest and speculation about their origins. The recent government shutdown has highlighted the challenges of public communication during critical scientific events.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey back into interstellar space, scientists will analyze data collected from various observatories, including the James Webb Space Telescope. The focus will remain on debunking misinformation and providing accurate information about the comet's natural characteristics.</p>
