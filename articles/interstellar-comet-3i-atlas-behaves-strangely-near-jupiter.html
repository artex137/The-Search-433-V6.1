      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Behaves Strangely Near Jupiter</h2>

<p>NASA has reported that interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has exhibited unusual behavior near Jupiter, as astronomers continue to monitor its trajectory ahead of a close approach on March 16, 2026. The comet, which is only the third confirmed interstellar object to pass through the solar system, poses no threat to Earth, according to NASA.</p>

<p>This unusual behavior matters because it may provide insights into the comet's composition and activity. Researchers are particularly interested in the comet's lopsided appearance and the implications of its jet-like structures, which may reveal details about its rotation and outgassing mechanisms.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS reached perihelion on October 30, 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth occurred on December 19, 2025, at approximately 1.8 AU (170 million miles).</li>
    <li>Projected close approach to Jupiter is on March 16, 2026, at about 0.358 AU (53.6 million km).</li>
    <li>NASA has tracked the comet using multiple spacecraft, including Hubble and Parker Solar Probe.</li>
    <li>Observations have shown a periodic modulation in the comet's jet structure, suggesting a rotation period of roughly 15.5 hours.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has been under observation since its discovery. Key events include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>October 30, 2025: The comet reaches perihelion, coming closest to the Sun.</li>
    <li>December 19, 2025: The comet's closest approach to Earth occurs at 1.8 AU.</li>
    <li>March 16, 2026: The comet is projected to make a close approach to Jupiter.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “NASA’s official overview presents 3I/ATLAS as an interstellar comet with a dust-and-gas coma, imaged repeatedly across missions, and emphasizes that the object behaves like a comet and poses no threat to Earth.” 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “The periodicity can imply a nucleus rotation period of roughly 15.5 hours.” 
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is significant as it provides a rare opportunity to study an interstellar object. Unlike typical comets that return after orbiting the Sun, 3I/ATLAS will not return, making its observations crucial for understanding the characteristics of such objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to observe 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Jupiter. The March 2026 flyby is expected to yield further data that could clarify the comet's physical properties and activity patterns.</p>
