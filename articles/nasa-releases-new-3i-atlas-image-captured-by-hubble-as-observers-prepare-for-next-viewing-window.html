      <h2>NASA Releases New 3I/ATLAS Image Captured by Hubble As Observers Prepare for Next Viewing Window</h2>

<p>The US space agency NASA has released new images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, captured by the Hubble Space Telescope on 30 November. The images provide a clear view of the comet following its close pass of the Sun in late October, confirming that the object remains active as it moves back into deep space.</p>

<p>This release is significant as astronomers prepare for a series of viewing opportunities in mid-December. The comet is currently hundreds of millions of kilometres away from Earth and is not visible to the naked eye. However, equipped amateur astronomers will have the chance to observe it using telescopes during the upcoming viewing windows.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Hubble images taken on 30 November 2023.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to the Sun in late October 2023.</li>
    <li>Optimal viewing times: North America - 4:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m. EST; UK and Europe - 5:00 a.m. to 7:00 a.m. GMT.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth is on 19 December 2023.</li>
    <li>Comet shows trails of gas and dust as it moves away from the Sun.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 28 August, researchers detected methanol production from 3I/ATLAS. This was followed by additional detections on 18 September, 22 September, and 1 October. Hydrogen cyanide was detected on 12 September and 15 September. The comet made its closest approach to the Sun in late October 2023.</p>

<p>The European Space Agency (ESA) captured images of 3I/ATLAS on 2 November 2023, providing further insights into the comet's activity. Hubble's latest images confirm that the comet is still releasing gas and dust.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Not only do we clearly see the glowing halo of gas surrounding the comet known as its coma, we also see a hint of two tails,” an ESA spokesperson said. “The comet's 'plasma tail' – made up of electrically charged gas, stretches out towards the top of the frame.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The observations of 3I/ATLAS have revealed a high methanol-to-hydrogen cyanide ratio, which is one of the highest ever recorded after the comet C/2016 R2. Methanol is a key ingredient for forming complex organic molecules, suggesting that 3I/ATLAS may have formed in a cold, carbon-rich environment.</p>

<p>This unique chemical fingerprint allows astronomers to study the conditions of another star's protoplanetary disk, potentially reshaping our understanding of planetary system formation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Observers can look forward to enhanced viewing opportunities as 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth on 19 December 2023. Scientists will continue to analyze the comet's outgassing to gather more data on its origins and the conditions of its formation.</p>
