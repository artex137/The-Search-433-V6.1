      <h2>3I/ATLAS: 'Wrong Way' Tail Pointing at Sun Has Scientists 'Stumped'</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile, has arrived in our solar system, presenting researchers with a unique astronomical puzzle. This comet, which originates from a star system light-years away, is only the third confirmed interstellar comet ever observed, following 'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. It has captured global attention due to its unusual 'anti-tail' phenomenon.</p>

<p>The appearance of 3I/ATLAS is significant for scientists as it offers a rare opportunity to study the materials and processes of distant star systems. Researchers are collaborating across continents, utilizing telescopes in various countries to gather data before the comet moves too far away for observation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered on July 1, 2025, in Chile.</li>
    <li>Only the third interstellar comet observed.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun occurred in late October 2025.</li>
    <li>Expected to pass within 270 million kilometres of Earth in mid-December 2025.</li>
    <li>Comet's nucleus estimated to be 5.6 kilometres across.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2025. It reached its perihelion, or closest point to the Sun, in late October 2025. The comet's trajectory is hyperbolic, indicating it will leave the solar system soon after its December 2025 pass near Earth.</p>

<p>Researchers have noted the comet’s strange movements and changes in brightness, prompting them to work quickly to gather as much data as possible.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The anti-tail of 3I/ATLAS remains an astronomical enigma— but a deeply significant one,” said a spokesperson for the research team. “Every unusual feature provides a unique opportunity to learn something new about how space objects are formed.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is noteworthy not only for its interstellar origin but also for its peculiar features, such as the anti-tail that points towards the Sun. This phenomenon challenges existing theories about comet behavior and composition. Previous interstellar comets, like 'Oumuamua, have also sparked scientific debate, but 3I/ATLAS presents new questions regarding its dust composition and internal structure.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers are focused on collecting more data and high-resolution images of 3I/ATLAS before it becomes too distant for observation. Understanding the true cause of the anti-tail and the comet's overall characteristics is a priority for the scientific community.</p>
