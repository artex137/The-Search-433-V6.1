      <h2>Catch a Last Glimpse of the Massive Interstellar 3I/ATLAS Comet Before It Vanishes from Earth’s View</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has captivated astronomers since its detection by the NSF-DOE Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile on July 1, 2023. This unique celestial visitor is set to remain visible to ground-based observatories until the end of September 2023, after which it will disappear behind the Sun’s glare until early December.</p>

<p>The observation of 3I/ATLAS is significant as it marks only the third interstellar object observed passing through our solar system. NASA and partners, including the European Space Agency (ESA), are actively studying the comet to enhance our understanding of its characteristics and origins.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered on July 1, 2023, by the ATLAS survey telescope.</li>
    <li>Visible to ground-based observatories until the end of September 2023.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun expected on October 30, 2023, at approximately 130 million miles.</li>
    <li>Estimated mass of the comet is 33 billion tons.</li>
    <li>Research indicates the comet is 3 to 5 times larger than previous interstellar objects 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was initially detected on July 1, 2023. Observations have continued since then, with various telescopes capturing detailed images of the comet. The comet will make its closest approach to the Sun on October 30, 2023, after which it will be obscured by the Sun until early December.</p>

<p>During its visibility period, advanced imaging techniques, including the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS), have provided vibrant images of the comet using multiple filters. These efforts contribute to the ongoing study of its unique characteristics.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We should not decide about the nature of 3I/ATLAS based on the chemical composition of its skin, for the same reason that we should not judge a book by its cover,” said Avi Loeb from Harvard University, co-author of a recent study on the comet.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object observed in our solar system, following 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Its size and chemical composition differ from previous discoveries, prompting further investigation into the origins of such celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA’s HiRISE camera aboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and the Juno spacecraft orbiting Jupiter are expected to provide further insights into 3I/ATLAS in the coming months, potentially unraveling more about its unusual characteristics.</p>
