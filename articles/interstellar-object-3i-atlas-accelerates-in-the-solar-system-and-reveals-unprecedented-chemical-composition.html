      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS accelerates in the solar system and reveals unprecedented chemical composition</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has been confirmed to be crossing the solar system at a speed of 57 km/s, according to space agencies. Discovered by the ATLAS telescope in Chile, the comet is not bound to the Sun and will exit the solar system after its passage. It will reach its closest point to the Sun on October 29, 2026, at a distance of 210 million kilometers, before making its closest approach to Earth in December, at 270 million kilometers, with no risk of collision.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it reveals unique characteristics of the comet, including an unusual chemical composition rich in carbon dioxide. NASA has coordinated an international campaign to study 3I/ATLAS, utilizing advanced astronomical instruments to gather data about its structure and origins.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object identified in the solar system.</li>
    <li>It was discovered by the ATLAS telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>The comet's perihelion occurs on October 29, 2026, at 210 million kilometers from the Sun.</li>
    <li>It will approach Earth at a distance of 270 million kilometers in December 2026.</li>
    <li>The comet travels at a speed of approximately 244,000 kilometers per hour.</li>
    <li>NASA is using the Hubble and James Webb telescopes for observations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected by the ATLAS telescope in Chile. Since its discovery, scientists have confirmed its hyperbolic trajectory, indicating that it is not gravitationally bound to the solar system.</p>
<p>On October 29, 2026, the comet will reach its perihelion, marking its closest approach to the Sun. Following this, it will pass within 97 million kilometers of Venus in November and cross the orbit of Jupiter in March 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Studying objects like this offers a rare window into the chemistry and processes of planet formation in other stars,” said a NASA spokesperson.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable for its composition, which differs significantly from typical comets observed in the solar system. Its high carbon dioxide content and the absence of a prominent dust tail raise questions about its classification and origin. The comet is estimated to be between 7 and 14 billion years old, possibly ejected from its home star system due to gravitational interactions.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and other agencies will continue to monitor and study 3I/ATLAS until it becomes too faint to observe in January 2026. Data collected from its passage will help scientists understand the diversity of celestial bodies and the formation processes of other solar systems.</p>
