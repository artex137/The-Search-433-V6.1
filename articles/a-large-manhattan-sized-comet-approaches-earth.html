      <h2>A large Manhattan-sized comet approaches Earth</h2>

<p>A large comet, ZI/ATLAS, has been approaching Earth at high speed, according to a report from the Russian Space Research Institute published on December 1, 2025. There have been no reports of injuries or fatalities associated with this event.</p>

<p>This comet's approach is significant for astronomers, as it is one of the most prominent comets currently visible in the sky. Authorities and scientists are monitoring its trajectory and brightness closely, especially as its brightness has notably decreased in recent days.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet ZI/ATLAS is approximately the size of Manhattan.</li>
    <li>The comet was first detected on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Its brightness has decreased by almost 63% over the past six days.</li>
    <li>Current stellar magnitude ranges from 10.1 to 10.6.</li>
    <li>It has moved closer to Earth by 10 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>The comet is estimated to be over 7.5 billion years old.</li>
    <li>ZI/ATLAS ranks fourth among visible comets, with C/2025 A6 (Lemmon) currently at the top.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet ZI/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025. Since then, it has been observed as it approaches Earth, with its distance decreasing significantly. In recent days, astronomers have noted a sharp decline in its brightness, prompting further study.</p>
<p>On December 1, 2025, reports indicated that despite its proximity, the comet's brightness had diminished due to it moving away from the Sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The main reason for the decrease in brightness is that the comet is gradually moving away from the Sun,” said a spokesperson from the Solar Astronomy Laboratory.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet ZI/ATLAS is unique not only for its size and age but also for its journey from other star systems. Its current observations have sparked interest in its physical characteristics and potential changes as it continues its approach.</p>
<p>Historically, comets have been significant for scientific study, providing insights into the early solar system and cosmic phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor ZI/ATLAS as it approaches Earth, observing any further changes in its brightness and trajectory. There are no current plans for further public safety measures, as the comet poses no immediate threat to Earth.</p>
