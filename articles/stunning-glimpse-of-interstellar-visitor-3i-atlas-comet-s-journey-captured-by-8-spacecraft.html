      <h2>Stunning glimpse of interstellar visitor: 3I/ATLAS comet’s journey captured by 8 spacecraft</h2>

<p>NASA has captured a rare cosmic event as Comet 3I/ATLAS, the third confirmed interstellar object to visit the solar system, has drawn the attention of a dozen spacecraft during its journey through space. The observation campaign began when the ATLAS telescope in Chile flagged the comet on July 1, 2023. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to the comet's approach.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it offers scientists a unique opportunity to study the chemical composition of an interstellar object, which may challenge existing theories about the formation of comets and planets in other star systems. NASA has mobilized various instruments across the solar system to capture data on the comet as it approaches Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet will make its closest approach to Earth, at a distance of 170 million miles, on December 19, 2023.</li>
    <li>NASA has deployed a dozen spacecraft, including the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and the MAVEN spacecraft.</li>
    <li>Hubble and the James Webb Space Telescope have also participated in the observation campaign.</li>
    <li>The comet is expected to fade past Jupiter by spring 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The observation of Comet 3I/ATLAS began with its detection by the ATLAS early-warning system on July 1, 2023. Following this alert, NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and MAVEN spacecraft began tracking the comet as it approached Mars, approximately 19 million miles away.</p>
<p>In July, Hubble Space Telescope captured images of the comet, followed by observations from the James Webb Space Telescope in August. NASA’s PUNCH mission also tracked the comet as it moved behind the Sun, capturing its tail as it interacted with solar particles.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“These observations are far from just pretty pictures—they’re glimpses into which molecules braved the journey through space and what their survival says about the comet’s origins,” said a NASA representative.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable because it is only the third interstellar object detected, following ‘Oumuamua in 2017 and Comet Borisov in 2019. The detection of these objects has sparked interest in the frequency of such visitors to our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As Comet 3I/ATLAS approaches its closest point to Earth in December 2023, NASA will continue to monitor its trajectory and gather data. The findings may provide insights into the composition of comets from other star systems and contribute to ongoing research in planetary science.</p>
