      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Turns Blue Following Perihelion</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has undergone a significant color change, appearing “distinctly bluer than the Sun” near its perihelion on October 29, 2025, according to data from NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). The comet has shown three color phases since its discovery: red, green, and now blue.</p>

<p>This blue shift indicates a dominance of gas emissions over dust in the comet's visible light output. Authorities such as astronomers from JPL and Lowell Observatory are closely monitoring the comet’s behavior as it becomes more visible from Earth following its perihelion.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Perihelion date:</strong> October 29, 2025, at approximately 11:35 UTC.</li>
    <li><strong>Color changes:</strong> Red in July, green in September, blue near perihelion.</li>
    <li><strong>Brightness trend:</strong> An unusually steep brightening trend observed, scaling approximately as r^−7.5 ± 1.0.</li>
    <li><strong>First optical images:</strong> Captured between October 31 and November 2, 2025.</li>
    <li><strong>Size estimate:</strong> Nucleus is less than 3.5 miles (5.6 km) across.</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to Earth:</strong> Expected on December 19, 2025, at approximately 1.8 astronomical units away.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 29, 2025, Comet 3I/ATLAS reached perihelion, marking the closest point to the Sun in its hyperbolic orbit. Following this, astronomer Qicheng Zhang captured the first optical images of the comet from October 31 to November 2, revealing its new blue color.</p>
<p>Prior to perihelion, the comet had been observed displaying a red hue due to dust emissions, transitioning to green in September before its recent blue phase, which suggests a significant increase in gas emissions.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It won’t look very impressive, it’s just a smudge,” said Qicheng Zhang regarding the initial visibility of the comet, but he noted that it should become easier to track as solar elongation increases.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is not the first significant observation of an interstellar comet. Previous events have shown similar behavior in terms of color and brightness changes as these celestial bodies approach the Sun. The ongoing monitoring efforts by multiple agencies, including JPL and NASA, reflect a growing interest in understanding the characteristics of interstellar visitors.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further analyses are expected from various observatories, including STEREO, SOHO, and the James Webb Space Telescope, as the geometry improves. The visibility of 3I/ATLAS is anticipated to increase through mid-November, making it a target for amateur astronomers.</p>
