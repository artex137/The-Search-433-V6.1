      <h2>From E.T. to GPTs: How 'aliens' figure in our narratives</h2>

<p>The concept of aliens has influenced various narratives, including science fiction, immigration, and artificial intelligence, according to social and political scientist Christian Peters from Bremen University. Peters has discussed how the imagery of aliens has evolved over time, reflecting cultural anxieties and societal changes. He cites significant examples, including the iconic grey extraterrestrials that have become prevalent in modern media.</p>

<p>This topic is increasingly relevant as authorities and scholars examine the implications of extraterrestrial life and how it mirrors human societal issues. The upcoming first European UAP symposium in late October 2023 in Italy will gather scientists and policymakers to discuss unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) and their ramifications.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Christian Peters is the managing director of Bremen University’s International Graduate School of Social Sciences.</li>
    <li>The first European UAP symposium will take place in late October 2023 in Italy.</li>
    <li>The term "flying saucer" originated in 1947 following a sighting by pilot Kenneth Arnold.</li>
    <li>The depiction of aliens in media has shifted from Cold War paranoia to themes of corporate exploitation and ecological dread.</li>
    <li>The term "alien" has historical roots in Latin, meaning "belonging to another" or "foreign."</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 1947, pilot Kenneth Arnold reported seeing nine shiny objects near Mount Rainier, leading to the coining of the term "flying saucer." This event marked a significant moment in the popular imagination of UFOs. Throughout the 1950s, films like "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" reflected Cold War fears by portraying aliens as communist infiltrators. The 1979 film "Alien" highlighted corporate greed, while Spielberg's "E.T." (1982) offered a more sympathetic view of extraterrestrials.</p>
<p>By the late 1990s and early 2000s, series like "The X Files" suggested conspiracies involving aliens and government secrecy. More recent films such as "Arrival" (2016) and "Nope" (2022) have delved into complex themes like grief and communication. As discussions around UAPs gain traction, the upcoming symposium in Italy signifies a growing interest in the reality of extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The book's cover featured the now-iconic grey face — the kind seen by people who've claimed to have had abduction experiences or first contact events,” said Christian Peters, referencing Whitley Strieber's "Communion: A True Story."
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "AI is not a weak form of human intelligence. It is an alien intelligence," said Harvard professor Chris Dede in a 2023 interview with TechTrends.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "The way that the technology that we have invented actually comes to the end that it produces, that's a historically new situation that has never existed before," added Christian Peters on the nature of AI.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The portrayal of aliens in popular culture has often mirrored societal fears. In the 1950s, the theme of alien infiltration resonated with Cold War anxieties. The representation of aliens has since evolved, reflecting contemporary issues such as corporate exploitation and environmental concerns. The term "alien" has also been used in immigration debates, with recent discussions in the U.S. regarding the terminology used to describe noncitizens.</p>
<p>In 2021, the Biden administration proposed replacing "alien" with "noncitizen," but the term was reinstated by ICE in January 2023. This reflects ongoing tensions around identity and belonging in many societies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The upcoming European UAP symposium aims to explore the implications of unidentified anomalous phenomena and the possibility of extraterrestrial life. Discussions may influence future policies and public perceptions regarding aliens and related topics.</p>
