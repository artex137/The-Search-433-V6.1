      <h2>China beats the US: First to capture images of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>China has captured the first images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS near Mars on October 3, 2023, while NASA has yet to release its own images due to a federal government shutdown in the United States. The China National Space Administration (CNSA) shared photos taken by its Tianwen-1 orbiter, which has been orbiting Mars since February 2021.</p>

<p>The capture of these images is significant as it marks a notable achievement in space exploration, raising questions about the comet's characteristics and behavior. The scientific community is now looking forward to data from NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, which has also photographed the comet but has not made the images public.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS passed within approximately 29 million kilometers of Mars on October 3, 2023.</li>
    <li>China's Tianwen-1 orbiter captured images using its High-Resolution Imaging Camera.</li>
    <li>The comet's coma measures between 5,000 and 10,000 kilometers across.</li>
    <li>NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has not released its images due to the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, which began on October 1, 2023.</li>
    <li>Rep. Anna Paulina Luna has communicated with NASA regarding the release of the images once the government reopens.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar comet to visit the solar system.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 3, 2023, comet 3I/ATLAS made a close approach to Mars, allowing both China's Tianwen-1 and NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter to capture images. Following the comet's passage, China released its images, showcasing a glowing core and a massive coma. NASA's images remain unreleased due to the federal government shutdown, which has delayed data sharing.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“As soon as the government reopens, they'll be releasing images/data. Unfortunately, due to bureaucratic reasons they cannot until then,” said Rep. Anna Paulina Luna regarding NASA’s delay in releasing images.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb expressed hope for the release of better images from NASA's HiRISE camera. “Here's hoping for better images from NASA's HiRISE in the coming days,” he wrote in his blog.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable for being only the third interstellar comet detected in the solar system. Its behavior has drawn significant attention from scientists, particularly due to its unexpected characteristics, such as the absence of a visible tail during its perihelion passage. The comet's unusual features have sparked discussions in the scientific community, raising questions about the physical properties of interstellar comets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists are awaiting the release of NASA's images and data to further analyze comet 3I/ATLAS. The ongoing government shutdown in the U.S. will determine the timeline for this release, while researchers continue to study the images provided by China for insights into this unique celestial object.</p>
