      <h2>What will be the next comets visible from Earth?</h2>

<p>Several comets, including Comet 3I/ATLAS, will become visible from Earth in the coming months, particularly with the aid of binoculars or small telescopes. Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2023, by the ATLAS program in Rio Hurtado, Chile, and is notable for being only the third interstellar object detected to date.</p>

<p>This information is significant for astronomers and skywatchers, as it provides opportunities for observation of these celestial bodies. Authorities and astronomers are preparing to share observations and updates regarding these comets as they approach visibility during late 2023 and early 2024.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered on July 1, 2023.</li>
    <li>Visible again in late November 2023 with a magnitude of 11-12.</li>
    <li>Requires a telescope of 80 to 150 mm to observe.</li>
    <li>Comet 210P/Christensen will reach perihelion on November 22, 2025.</li>
    <li>Magnitude of 9.9, not visible to the naked eye.</li>
    <li>Comet Schaumasse will peak around January 2026 with a magnitude of 10/10.5.</li>
    <li>R3 PanSTARRS discovered on September 8, 2025, may reach magnitude 3 by late April 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2023, and has generated interest due to its interstellar origin. It reappeared after passing behind the Sun, displaying a tail directed towards the Sun. Astronomers expect it to be visible again in late November 2023.</p>

<p>Comet 210P/Christensen, discovered on May 26, 2003, will reach its perihelion on November 22, 2025. It has an orbital period of 5.7 years, making it regularly visible from Earth.</p>

<p>Comet Schaumasse, first observed on December 1, 1911, will reach its maximum visibility in January 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The discovery of Comet 3I/ATLAS has opened new discussions regarding interstellar objects and their trajectories,” said astronomer Kacper Wierzchos, who observed the comet using images from the Mount Lemmon Observatory.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is significant as it is only the third interstellar object detected, following the discoveries of 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Comets like 210P/Christensen and Schaumasse have established observation patterns, allowing astronomers to predict their visibility and behavior.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to monitor Comet 3I/ATLAS and other comets as they approach visibility. Observations are expected to increase as these comets reach their predicted magnitudes in late 2023 and early 2026.</p>
