      <h2>Interstellar object 3I/ATLAS is leaving the solar system</h2>

<p>Interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, the third known object to enter our solar system from interstellar space, has made its closest pass by the sun and is now departing the solar system. The object's perihelion occurred at 11:47 UTC (6:47 a.m. CDT) on October 29, 2025, when it was approximately 1.36 AU from the sun.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it marks a key moment in the study of interstellar objects and their origins. Observations of 3I/ATLAS will continue, with the next closest approach to Earth expected around December 19, 2025, when it will be about 1.8 AU away. Additionally, the European Space Agency's Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) will observe the comet in late November 2025.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Closest approach to the sun: October 29, 2025, at 11:47 UTC</li>
    <li>Distance from the sun at perihelion: 1.36 AU</li>
    <li>Next closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2025, at 1.8 AU</li>
    <li>Observations by ESA’s JUICE from November 2 to 25, 2025</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Mars: October 3, 2025, at 4 UTC</li>
    <li>Distance from Mars at closest approach: approximately 18 million miles (29 million kilometers)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to Mars on October 3, 2025, at 4 UTC, approximately 18 million miles from the planet. During this time, both the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) and Mars Express captured images of the comet. The TGO successfully recorded images when the object was about 20 million miles away on October 3.</p>

<p>The object reached its perihelion on October 29, 2025, at 11:47 UTC. It is currently behind the sun from Earth's perspective, making it invisible in the night sky until it returns to view around November 11, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS is a key probe of the galactic population of icy planetesimals,” said Xabier Pérez-Couto of the University of A Coruña in Spain. “It has been drifting through interstellar space for billions of years.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object to visit our solar system, providing valuable insights into the composition and formation of celestial bodies. Previous interstellar objects, such as 1I/2017 U1 (Oumuamua) and 2I/Borisov, have also contributed to our understanding of these distant visitors.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth in December 2025. Observations from ESA’s JUICE will provide data on the comet's characteristics, with results expected in February 2026.</p>
