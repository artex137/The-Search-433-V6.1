      <h2>3I/ATLAS: Avi Loeb Says It’s Gaining Speed, Not Slowing Down</h2>

<p>Harvard scientist <strong>Avi Loeb</strong> has proposed a controversial theory regarding the interstellar object <strong>3I Atlas</strong>, suggesting it may not be a natural comet but a spacecraft. His claims have sparked debate within the scientific community, particularly following recent observations indicating the object is gaining speed after its close approach to the sun.</p>

<p>Loeb's assertions challenge conventional understanding of comet behavior and have prompted further investigation into 3I Atlas. His analysis highlights various anomalies that could redefine our understanding of interstellar objects. As new data emerges, astronomers are closely monitoring the object to evaluate its true nature.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I Atlas was first detected in 2017.</li>
    <li>On November 8, 2023, astronomers captured images showing a complex tail structure.</li>
    <li>On November 9, 2023, additional observations revealed an “anti-tail” pointing towards the sun.</li>
    <li>Loeb argues that the behavior of 3I Atlas suggests it may be using gravitational assists to accelerate.</li>
    <li>Images show jets extending nearly 1 million kilometers towards the sun.</li>
    <li>The majority of scientists still classify 3I Atlas as a comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I Atlas has exhibited unusual behavior since its detection. On November 8, a team of astronomers, including M. Jagger, G. Rayman, and E. Prosperi, captured images of its complex tail. The following day, Michael Buchner and Frank Nebling observed additional tail structures, including an anti-tail. On November 9, David Jwitt and Jane Louu used the Nordic Optical Telescope to take more images, which depicted the object resembling a bright ball of light with an anti-tail directed at the sun.</p>

<p>Loeb has linked these observations to his hypothesis that 3I Atlas is not behaving like a typical comet, which usually breaks apart as it approaches the sun. Instead, he suggests the object may be intact and possibly utilizing technology to accelerate.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The anti-tail is a crucial indicator that the object is undergoing acceleration,” Loeb stated, emphasizing its potential implications for understanding interstellar objects.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Loeb challenged the scientific community, saying, “Explain the numerous anomalies surrounding the object if it is indeed a natural comet.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The debate over 3I Atlas reflects broader discussions in the scientific community regarding the nature of interstellar objects. While some experts support Loeb's theory, the prevailing view remains that 3I Atlas is a comet, leading to a divide in interpretations of its behavior. This controversy highlights the need for continued observation and analysis of such objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to monitor 3I Atlas as new data emerges. Ongoing observations may provide further insights into its behavior and composition, potentially reshaping our understanding of interstellar objects.</p>
