      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS intrigues NASA with unique chemical composition and billion-year origin</h2>

<p>Astronomers from NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) have detected the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS on July 1, 2025, using the ATLAS telescope in Chile. This comet is identified as the third object from outside the Solar System and has exhibited hyperbolic movement and unusual bluish light. It passed through perihelion on October 30, 2025, at a distance of 1.4 astronomical units from the Sun, without posing any threat to Earth, which remains 1.8 astronomical units away.</p>

<p>The analysis of 3I/ATLAS is significant as it may provide insights into ancient galactic origins. Coordinated observations aim to examine its chemical composition and trajectory. The comet has confirmed cometary activity, featuring a diffuse coma and dust tail, and is estimated to be between 7 and 14 billion years old, predating the formation of the Solar System.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Detected on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>Passed perihelion on October 30, 2025, at 1.4 astronomical units from the Sun.</li>
    <li>Approached Mars on October 3, 2025, within 30 million km.</li>
    <li>Hyperbolic speed recorded at 137,000 km/h.</li>
    <li>Coma diameter expanded from 13,000 km to 18,000 km in July 2025.</li>
    <li>Chemical traces include carbonyl sulfide and water vapor.</li>
    <li>Estimated age ranges from 7.6 to 14 billion years.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers detected 3I/ATLAS as a faint dot. By July 21, telescopes in Hawaii, Chile, and Australia confirmed its interstellar origin, with Hubble capturing images of the comet's reddish coma. On October 3, the comet passed near Mars, allowing spacecraft to collect spectral data. It reached perihelion on October 30, 2025, and is expected to pass Venus on November 3, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“NASA classifies 3I/ATLAS as a natural comet, with no evidence of technological origin,” said a spokesperson. “The spectra are consistent with gas sublimation.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The detection of 3I/ATLAS contributes to ongoing studies of interstellar objects. Previous interstellar comets, such as 1I/2017 U1 and 2I/Borisov, have provided valuable insights into the composition of celestial bodies beyond our Solar System. The ongoing research aims to enhance understanding of planetary formation and early galactic chemistry.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>ESA is preparing the Comet Interceptor mission for 2029, which will be in standby orbit to intercept pristine comets, including potential interstellar ones like 3I/ATLAS. Continuous observations will provide further data for studies on the comet's trajectory and chemical properties.</p>
