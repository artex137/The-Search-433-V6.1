      <h2>Is 3I/ATLAS a comet or something else? The debate continues...</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, discovered on July 1, 2023, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS), has sparked a debate among scientists regarding its origins and characteristics. The comet is currently traversing our solar system and has exhibited unusual jets and colour changes, prompting some experts to suggest it could be an alien spacecraft.</p>

<p>This debate matters as it raises questions about the nature of celestial objects and the potential for extraterrestrial life. Authorities, including NASA and various astronomers, are studying 3I/ATLAS to understand its unusual features. While some experts argue for a natural explanation, others remain open to the possibility of an artificial origin.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered on July 1, 2023, by ATLAS, a global early warning network.</li>
    <li>ATLAS is funded by NASA and operates telescopes in multiple countries, including the US, Chile, and South Africa.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is on a hyperbolic orbit and will return to deep space, posing no threat to Earth.</li>
    <li>The comet will pass near Venus, Mars, and Jupiter, but not Earth.</li>
    <li>Some social media users have circulated claims that 3I/ATLAS resembles a spacecraft.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2023, by the ATLAS network. Since its discovery, astronomers have noted its unusual characteristics, including strange jets and colour changes. The debate about its potential origins has intensified, with prominent figures like Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb suggesting it could be an alien spacecraft, while others, including NASA scientists, argue for a natural explanation.</p>

<p>As of now, 3I/ATLAS continues its trajectory through the solar system, closely aligned with the orbital planes of various planets.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb, a Harvard astronomer, has claimed, “3I/ATLAS could be an alien spacecraft, citing its unusual trajectory, acceleration and lack of a typical cometary tail as potential evidence of its artificial origin.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Neil deGrasse Tyson, a renowned astrophysicist, has dismissed the alien theory, stating, “We have good data on our own comets and asteroids and moons and planets.... You want to say aliens are coming? OK, it's clickbait.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS follows the earlier findings of interstellar objects, such as ‘Oumuamua, which has also sparked discussions regarding extraterrestrial life. The scientific community remains divided on the interpretations of such objects, balancing between natural explanations and the allure of artificial origins.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Ongoing studies will continue to examine the composition and behaviour of 3I/ATLAS as it moves through the solar system. Researchers aim to understand whether its unique activity holds clues to the formation of other solar systems.</p>
