      <h2>'Aliens Walk Among Us' Claims Whistleblower – And Some of Them Are Famous Figures</h2>

<p>A UFO whistleblower has claimed that extraterrestrials have been living among humans for thousands of years, including potentially as some of history's most influential figures. Daniel 'Danny' Sheehan, a US lawyer known for his involvement in congressional testimony on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs), made these assertions during a podcast nearly two years ago.</p>

<p>Sheehan's claims have reignited discussions about alien life and government cover-ups. He suggests that these non-human intelligences are significantly more advanced than humanity, both technologically and mentally. His statements have prompted calls for further investigation from authorities and heightened public interest in the subject.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Whistleblower: Daniel 'Danny' Sheehan, US lawyer</li>
    <li>Claims: Extraterrestrials living among humans for thousands of years</li>
    <li>Podcast appearance: Nearly two years ago</li>
    <li>Allegations: Government programs studying recovered UFOs</li>
    <li>Potential figures: Historical figures like Jesus Christ and Buddha may have been advanced beings</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In his podcast appearance nearly two years ago, Daniel 'Danny' Sheehan made a series of claims regarding extraterrestrial beings and their interaction with humanity. He suggested that these beings are biologically connected to humans but have evolved beyond current human capabilities, possessing advanced abilities such as telepathy and teleportation.</p>

<p>Sheehan has since reiterated his claims of secret government programs that study non-human craft, alleging the existence of hidden facilities where these technologies are analyzed. He has also linked these beings to historical figures, suggesting that ancient societies misinterpreted their abilities as divine.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "They're not supernatural entities or spirits from another realm," Sheehan said. "They are biologically connected to us — part of the same human family — but they've evolved far beyond what we currently recognise as human potential."
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "Yes. There's no doubt about it," Sheehan responded when asked if his theory could explain the origins of organised religion.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Sheehan's claims build on a long history of speculation regarding extraterrestrial life and government secrecy. Previous incidents and disclosures have fueled conspiracy theories about alien abduction and covert experimentation. His recent role in helping whistleblowers present evidence to Congress highlights ongoing efforts for transparency regarding UAP encounters.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As public interest in Sheehan's claims grows, there may be increased pressure on authorities to investigate and disclose information regarding UAPs and potential extraterrestrial interactions. Sheehan believes that a moment of reckoning regarding government secrecy is approaching.</p>
