      <h2>Interstellar comet makes safe flyby of Earth</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/Atlas has made its closest approach to Earth, passing at a distance of 167 million miles (269 million kilometers) earlier this week. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to the event.</p>

<p>This flyby is significant as it marks the third known interstellar object to pass through our solar system. NASA continues to monitor the comet with its space telescopes, providing a rare opportunity for backyard astronomers to observe it as it fades while exiting the solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas was discovered by NASA's Atlas telescope in July.</li>
    <li>Estimated size: between 440 meters and 5.6 kilometers.</li>
    <li>Closest approach distance: 167 million miles (269 million kilometers).</li>
    <li>Next significant flyby: March 2024, passing within 33 million miles (53 million kilometers) of Jupiter.</li>
    <li>Previous interstellar objects include the first confirmed object in 2017 and another in 2019.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas was discovered in July 2023 by NASA's Atlas telescope in Chile. It made its closest approach to Earth this week, providing a unique observational opportunity for astronomers.</p>
<p>After this flyby, the comet will continue its journey back to interstellar space and will not return for thousands of years. It is expected to pass much closer to Jupiter in March 2024.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/Atlas is a rare and intriguing subject for study, as it may have formed in a star system much older than our own,” said a NASA representative.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interstellar comets differ from those like Halley's, which originate from the solar system's outer regions. 3I/Atlas is significant as one of the few known interstellar objects, following the first confirmed object discovered in Hawaii in 2017 and another found by a Crimean amateur astronomer in 2019.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Nasa will continue to monitor 3I/Atlas as it exits the solar system and prepares for its upcoming close encounter with Jupiter in March 2024.</p>
