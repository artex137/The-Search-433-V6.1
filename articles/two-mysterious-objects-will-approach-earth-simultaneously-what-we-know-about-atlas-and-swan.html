      <h2>Two Mysterious Objects Will Approach Earth Simultaneously: What We Know About ATLAS and SWAN</h2>

<p>Researchers have identified two unusual cosmic objects, 3I/ATLAS and SWAN, which will approach Earth closely at the end of October. The object 3I/ATLAS will come nearest on October 29, while SWAN will do so on October 25. There are no reported injuries or fatalities related to these celestial events.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it presents new challenges for astronomers and observatories worldwide. According to astrophysics popularizer Valentin Hadenov, the simultaneous approach of these two objects raises questions about their origins and nature. Scientists are currently tracking both objects to gather more data ahead of their closest encounters with Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Objects:</strong> 3I/ATLAS and SWAN</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach dates:</strong> SWAN on October 25, ATLAS on October 29</li>
    <li><strong>Diameter of ATLAS:</strong> Estimated between 5 to 15 kilometers</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery of SWAN:</strong> September 11, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Observatories:</strong> Worldwide tracking both objects</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has garnered attention due to its unusual behavior, moving in the plane of the Solar System's ecliptic and emitting large amounts of carbon dioxide and nickel-cyanide combinations. SWAN was discovered on September 11, emerging from behind the Sun. Both objects are on nearly synchronous trajectories relative to Earth, with only a four-day difference in their closest approaches.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The main oddity is that these two objects - ATLAS and this SWAN - will fly at their closest point to Earth practically simultaneously, with a difference of just four days,” emphasized Valentin Hadenov.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“This is a gigantic core for a celestial body. If it were to collide with us somehow, it would be a very large catastrophe that Earth has probably never seen before,” added Hadenov, noting the potential impact of ATLAS.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of these two objects comes at a time when astronomers are increasingly focused on tracking near-Earth objects. Past incidents, such as the asteroid believed to have led to the extinction of the dinosaurs, highlight the potential dangers posed by large celestial bodies. The current interest in ATLAS and SWAN reflects ongoing efforts to understand and monitor such objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Observatories around the world will continue to monitor both ATLAS and SWAN as they approach Earth. Scientists hope to gather more data during their closest encounters, which may help clarify the origins and characteristics of these mysterious objects.</p>
