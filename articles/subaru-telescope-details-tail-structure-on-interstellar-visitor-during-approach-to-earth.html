      <h2>Subaru Telescope details tail structure on interstellar visitor during approach to Earth</h2>

<p>Astronomers have released detailed analyses of the celestial body 3I/ATLAS, observed by Telescópio Subaru in Havaí during mid-December 2025. The comet passed approximately 270 million kilometers from Earth, allowing scientists to gather unprecedented data about its physical structure. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This research is significant as it enhances the global scientific community's understanding of interstellar objects. The observations confirm the comet’s active sublimation processes, distinguishing it from typical asteroids. Continuous monitoring of 3I/ATLAS is crucial for understanding the formation of distant planetary systems.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Observation Date: Mid-December 2025</li>
    <li>Closest Approach to Earth: October 2025</li>
    <li>Distance at Closest Approach: 1.36 astronomical units from the Sun</li>
    <li>Initial Identification: July 2025 by the ATLAS warning system in Chile</li>
    <li>Rotation Period: Approximately 15 hours</li>
    <li>Ejection Speed of Dust Particles: 22 meters per second (1-micrometer dust), 2 meters per second (over 100 micrometers)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified in July 2025 by the ATLAS warning system in Chile. Its interstellar origin was confirmed through precise orbital calculations, which indicated a hyperbolic trajectory.</p>

<p>During its closest approach to the Sun in October 2025, 3I/ATLAS maintained a safe distance of 1.36 astronomical units. Observations continued into December 2025, when Telescópio Subaru captured high-resolution images that revealed the comet's active tail structure.</p>

<p>As of 2026, the comet follows an outward trajectory, progressing away from the inner planets and expected to cross the orbit of Marte in early 2026, reaching Jupiter's orbit around 2028.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The processed images clearly show the extension of the mane and tail, differentiating it from inert rocky bodies,” said a spokesperson from the Subaru Telescope team.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“This research reinforces the theory that planetary formation in other stars involves processes similar to those in our system,” the spokesperson added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar body confirmed to cross our solar system, following 1I/’Oumuamua and comet 2I/Borisov. Unlike ‘Oumuamua, which displayed no visible tail, 3I/ATLAS behaves like a “dirty comet,” releasing volatile materials as it approaches the Sun.</p>

<p>The study of 3I/ATLAS is part of a broader effort to understand the dynamics of interstellar objects and their role in planetary formation across the galaxy.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Large telescopes will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS in the coming months. The ongoing observations aim to build a statistical profile of interstellar objects and enhance understanding of their characteristics and behaviors.</p>
