      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS: From 2025 discovery to global sensation – now heading beyond Earth</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to Earth on Friday, December 19, 2025, coming within 168 million miles of the planet at 1 a.m. EST. Following its pass, the comet is now traveling towards the outer solar system and back into interstellar space. Since its discovery in July 2025, the comet has sparked widespread interest among scientists, space enthusiasts, and the public, leading to various theories regarding its origin.</p>

<p>The significance of 3I/ATLAS lies in its nature as the first interstellar object to come this close to Earth. Authorities have noted the rapid spread of information, along with misinformation, surrounding the comet. This has prompted ongoing discussions among scientists and the public about its characteristics and potential origins.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date of closest approach:</strong> December 19, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Earth:</strong> 168 million miles</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery date:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Notable figures:</strong> Avi Loeb, Larry Denneau, Qicheng Zhang</li>
    <li><strong>NASA shutdown:</strong> October 1 to November 12, 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first observed on July 1, 2025. Following its discovery, the comet quickly gained traction on social media, with claims of it being an alien spacecraft. This led to increased public interest and speculation.</p>

<p>The comet's closest approach to Earth occurred on December 19, 2025, at 1 a.m. EST. This significant event was preceded by a government shutdown that left many people seeking answers about the comet during a period of uncertainty.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “That seems to have given it a whole lot of extra time for conspiracy theorists to run wild and drum up attention.” 
    <cite>Qicheng Zhang, postdoctoral fellow at the Lowell Observatory</cite>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “Unfortunately, it all came during the shutdown. And so that created its own complications... thought NASA was trying to hide something.”
    <cite>Larry Denneau, scientist who discovered the comet</cite>
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The rapid spread of misinformation about 3I/ATLAS coincided with a government shutdown that paused many NASA activities. This period of inactivity fueled speculation and conspiracy theories regarding the comet's nature and origin.</p>

<p>Harvard professor Avi Loeb played a significant role in popularizing the comet, often suggesting it may be alien technology. His claims, while controversial, contributed to the comet becoming a mainstream topic of discussion, despite criticisms from the scientific community.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS moves away from Earth, scientists plan to continue their observations of the comet. They aim to gather further data despite the decline in public interest following its closest approach.</p>
