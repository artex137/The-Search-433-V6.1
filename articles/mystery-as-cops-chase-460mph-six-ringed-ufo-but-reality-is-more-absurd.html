      <h2>Mystery as cops chase 460mph 'six-ringed UFO'</h2>

<p>Police officers in Minneapolis have pursued a mysterious six-ringed UFO that nearly collided with a helicopter in February. The officers observed the unidentified aerial phenomena, or UAP, from a parking garage using binoculars, according to a report submitted to Americans for Safe Aerospace.</p>

<p>The report, led by former US Navy pilot Ryan Graves, details the officers' experience with the UAP, which exhibited unusual movement patterns and characteristics. Authorities are currently investigating the incident, while experts suggest alternative explanations for the sightings.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Incident occurred in February 2023.</li>
    <li>Location: Minneapolis, Minnesota.</li>
    <li>UAP observed at approximately 10,000 feet.</li>
    <li>UAP reportedly traveled at speeds of 460 mph.</li>
    <li>Observation lasted for 25 minutes before UAP moved north.</li>
    <li>A civilian helicopter approached the UAP, triggering its movement.</li>
    <li>Another UAP sighting occurred on July 7, 2023, in Anoka, Minnesota.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In February 2023, three Minneapolis police officers reported observing a UAP from a parking garage. They described the object as having six interlocking rings of changing colored lights and noted its unusual movement patterns. The UAP remained in the area for 25 minutes before a civilian helicopter prompted its departure.</p>

<p>On July 7, 2023, a similar object was spotted in Anoka, approximately 21 miles from Minneapolis. A witness reported seeing the UAP travel along the Mississippi River at high speeds before descending behind trees.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The UAP was moving with both slow and rapid acceleration, and exhibiting positive lift without noise,” police officers stated in the report.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>UAP sightings have gained increased attention in recent years, prompting investigations by various agencies. Former military personnel and officials have come forward with reports of unexplained aerial phenomena, leading to a broader discussion about the nature of these sightings.</p>

<p>Experts from Enigma Labs have suggested that some reported UAPs could be misidentified objects, such as the International Space Station, which has recently been visible in the area.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities are continuing their investigation into the sightings, and further analysis of the video evidence is expected to clarify the nature of the observed objects. No arrests have been made, and additional details have not been disclosed.</p>
