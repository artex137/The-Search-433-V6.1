      <h2>UFO clues emerge in decades-old images showing strange bursts over nuclear testing sites: report</h2>

<p>A set of photographs taken over 70 years ago may reveal new insights into unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs) near nuclear testing sites, according to a report published on October 20, 2025, in Nature’s Scientific Reports. Scientists at California’s Palomar Observatory have identified transient, star-like flashes in images from the 1950s that may correspond with UAP sightings and nuclear tests.</p>

<p>This research is significant as it suggests a potential link between UAP sightings and nuclear weapons activity. The study’s authors have analyzed digitized images captured from an initial survey conducted by the observatory from 1949 to 1957, prior to the launch of the first artificial satellite in October 1957. The findings may contribute to a better understanding of UAPs and their possible origins.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Study published on October 20, 2025.</li>
    <li>Photographs taken between 1949 and 1957 at California’s Palomar Observatory.</li>
    <li>Researchers identified 107,875 transient lights in the images.</li>
    <li>Transients were 45% more likely to be observed within 24 hours of nuclear testing.</li>
    <li>Final sighting over a nuclear testing site occurred on March 17, 1956.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>From 1949 to 1957, Palomar Observatory conducted an initial survey capturing images of the night sky. During this time, researchers analyzed these photographs and discovered transient lights, which they correlated with UAP sightings and nuclear tests.</p>
<p>Witnesses reported multiple UAP sightings above Washington, D.C., from July 19 to July 27, 1952, coinciding with the observation of bright transients in the same timeframe. The last documented transient over a nuclear testing site was noted on March 17, 1956, one day after the "Joe 21" test by Soviet Russia.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We speculate that some transients could potentially be UAP in Earth orbit that, if descending into the atmosphere, might provide the stimulus for some UAP sightings,” the paper states.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Our findings provide additional empirical support for the validity of the UAP phenomenon and its potential connection to nuclear weapons activity, contributing data beyond eyewitness reports,” the scientists wrote.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The study indicates that transient objects were observed over at least 124 above-ground nuclear testing sites active from 1951 until the launch of Sputnik in 1957. Researchers believe that these sightings may be associated with high-energy particles in the atmosphere, particularly during or shortly after nuclear tests.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further investigations may focus on analyzing additional historical data and eyewitness accounts to better understand the connection between UAPs and nuclear activity. The study's authors have not disclosed any immediate plans for follow-up research.</p>
