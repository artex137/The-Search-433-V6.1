      <h2>A Rare Interstellar Comet Just Flew by Mars—Here Are the Photos Captured by an Orbiting Spacecraft</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to Mars on Friday, October 6, 2023, as observed by the European Space Agency’s (ESA) ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter. The spacecraft captured impressive images of the comet, which is located approximately 18.6 million miles from Earth.</p>

<p>The images released by ESA on October 7, 2023, provide a unique view of this interstellar visitor. Scientists believe the observations will enhance understanding of the differences between interstellar comets and those from our own solar system. ESA continues to analyze data from the comet as it approaches the sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to Mars on October 6, 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet was approximately 18.6 million miles from the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter.</li>
    <li>ESA released images of the comet on October 7, 2023.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object in our solar system.</li>
    <li>The comet is expected to reach its closest point to the sun around the end of October 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet will pass Jupiter in March 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 6, 2023, Comet 3I/ATLAS approached Mars, allowing the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter to capture images of the comet. ESA released these images the following day, showcasing both the comet’s nucleus and its surrounding coma. As the comet continues on its path, it is expected to heat up and potentially reveal its tails.</p>

<p>NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has also taken images, but the agency is currently closed due to a government shutdown in the United States. ESA's Mars Express did not capture the comet, as its camera uses a shorter exposure time.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This was a very challenging observation for the instrument. The comet is around 10,000 to 100,000 times fainter than our usual target,” said Nicolas Thomas, principal investigator for the camera at the University of Bern.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The data is seemingly quite good—a sign of even more to come during Earth’s brief date with 3I/ATLAS,” stated Colin Wilson, a project scientist for the Trace Gas Orbiter.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“These objects are the first building blocks we can observe from those systems. They tell us about the conditions in the stellar system where they formed,” explained Michael Küeppers, project scientist on ESA’s Comet Interceptor mission.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable as only the third known interstellar object to pass through our solar system. These comets provide researchers with valuable insights into the conditions of other stellar systems, which can enhance understanding of cosmic formation processes.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>After its closest approach to the sun at the end of October 2023, the ESA’s Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) will observe Comet 3I/ATLAS. Data from these observations will not be available until February 2026, but they are expected to reveal more about the comet's activity as it interacts with solar radiation.</p>
