      <h2>China Beats NASA to Capture and Release First Close-Up Image of Interstellar Object 3I/Atlas</h2>

<p>China's Tianwen-1 Mars orbiter has captured and released the first close-range image of the interstellar object 3I/Atlas from a distance of approximately 30 million kilometres on October 3. This marks a significant achievement as 3I/Atlas is only the third confirmed visitor from outside the solar system.</p>

<p>The close-up image is a rare scientific milestone that provides valuable insights into the characteristics of interstellar objects. The China National Space Agency (CNSA) has stated that the images reveal distinctive features of a comet, including a bright central nucleus surrounded by a hazy coma. This observation supports ongoing studies into how interstellar objects form in planetary systems before being ejected into space.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/Atlas</li>
    <li>Date of image capture: October 3, 2023</li>
    <li>Distance from Mars during capture: Approximately 30 million km</li>
    <li>Mission: Tianwen-1, launched in February 2021</li>
    <li>Estimated size of nucleus: Up to 5.6 km in diameter</li>
    <li>Previous interstellar visitors: Oumuamua (2017) and Borisov (2019)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The Tianwen-1 orbiter has been operational since February 2021, primarily focusing on Mars. In early September 2023, the science team began planning observations of 3I/Atlas, taking into account its high speed and dim brightness. Adjustments to tracking algorithms and exposure techniques were necessary to capture the object effectively.</p>
<p>On October 3, 2023, Tianwen-1 successfully captured the close-up image of 3I/Atlas. The CNSA announced the achievement shortly after the event, highlighting the scientific significance of the capture.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The images reveal distinctive features of a comet,” said the CNSA, referring to the bright nucleus and hazy coma captured in the photograph.</blockquote>
<blockquote>NASA's lead scientist for small solar system bodies dismissed claims of non-natural origins, stating, “The object behaves consistently with known comets.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas is the third confirmed interstellar object, following Oumuamua and Borisov. These objects provide scientists with opportunities to study materials from outside our solar system. The Tianwen-1 mission is part of China's broader efforts to enhance its capabilities in planetary science and exploration.</p>
<p>China's space program has made significant progress, with the Tianwen-1 mission already delivering a rover to Mars and contributing to deep-space observations. The upcoming Tianwen-2 mission, launched earlier this year, aims to return samples from a near-Earth asteroid in 2026.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The data collected from the close-up images of 3I/Atlas will support further analysis of the object's path and composition. Scientists aim to compare this object with known comet and asteroid types from different star systems to better understand its origins.</p>
