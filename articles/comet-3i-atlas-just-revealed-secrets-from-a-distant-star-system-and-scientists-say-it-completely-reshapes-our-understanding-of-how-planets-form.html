      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Reveals Secrets from Distant Star System</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has unveiled its pristine composition from another star system after passing through our solar system in October 2025. This rare cosmic visitor has provided scientists with new insights into planetary formation, potentially reshaping current understanding across the galaxy.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it challenges existing models of cometary composition and offers a unique glimpse into the conditions of distant stellar environments. Authorities, including NASA and various international observatories, are continuing to analyze data collected from multiple telescopes to gain further insights into this comet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> July 1, 2025, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS)</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to Sun:</strong> October 30, 2025, at a distance of 130 million miles</li>
    <li><strong>Nucleus Diameter:</strong> Estimated between 440 meters and 5.6 kilometers</li>
    <li><strong>Composition:</strong> 87% carbon dioxide, 9% carbon monoxide, and 4% water</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to Earth:</strong> 270 million kilometers, approximately 1.8 times the distance between Earth and the sun</li>
    <li><strong>Water Production Rate:</strong> 3.17 × 10²⁹ water molecules per second after perihelion</li>
    <li><strong>Next Destination:</strong> Traveling toward Jupiter's orbit by March 2026</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the ATLAS telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile, discovered comet 3I/ATLAS and promptly reported it to the Minor Planet Center. The comet reached its closest approach to the sun on October 30, 2025, allowing scientists to conduct extensive observations from multiple telescopes worldwide.</p>

<p>Following perihelion, the SWAN instrument aboard SOHO detected water production from the comet. By November 6, 2025, measurements indicated a significant water molecule output. Observations continued as the comet traveled through the solar system, with researchers gathering data from various instruments.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The carbon dioxide to water ratio of 8:1 stands as the highest ever observed in any comet, fundamentally challenging conventional models of cometary composition,” said a NASA spokesperson.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“This pristine object allows us to study original stellar material virtually unaltered since its formation, offering insights into the conditions around distant stars,” stated a researcher at the International Gemini Observatory.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object, following 1I/’Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Unlike its predecessors, this comet has provided comprehensive data during its visit. Its unique chemical composition raises questions about the processes involved in forming comets in different stellar environments.</p>

<p>Interstellar objects like 3I/ATLAS are rare, with scientists estimating that Earth encounters such visitors roughly once per century. The pristine nature of this comet highlights the potential for future discoveries regarding the formation of planetary systems across the galaxy.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze data from NASA's Hubble Space Telescope, James Webb Space Telescope, and other ground-based instruments. This ongoing study aims to enhance understanding of planetary formation and the conditions required for worlds to develop throughout the universe.</p>
