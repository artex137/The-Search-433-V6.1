      <h2>3I/ATLAS shows unusual acceleration as it nears Earth</h2>

<p>Scientists are closely monitoring the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS as it approaches its closest point to Earth later this month. The comet, discovered in July, is only the third confirmed interstellar body ever observed entering our solar system. It has displayed unusual acceleration, prompting increased scrutiny from the astronomical community.</p>

<p>This phenomenon has drawn attention beyond scientific circles, particularly due to comments from theoretical physicist Avi Loeb, who described 3I/ATLAS as a “potentially hostile alien threat.” While there is no evidence to support this claim, it has sparked public debate about the object's behaviour and potential implications.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Discovery: July 2023</li>
    <li>Current behaviour: Non-gravitational acceleration at approximately 0.5 microns per second squared</li>
    <li>Nucleus size: Estimated at 375 metres wide</li>
    <li>Next closest approach to Earth: Later this month</li>
    <li>Key observation sources: NASA, Hubble Space Telescope</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first discovered in July 2023, marking it as a rare interstellar visitor. Since its discovery, astronomers have monitored its trajectory and behaviour, noting unusual acceleration not attributable to gravitational forces. Recent observations have revealed comet-like features, including a tail and an anti-tail, indicating the presence of outgassing.</p>

<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth, researchers are particularly interested in its acceleration patterns. This information may lead to new insights into the behaviour of interstellar materials as they enter the solar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Non-gravitational acceleration is a well-documented phenomenon and does not pose a threat to Earth,” said a NASA spokesperson. “However, the unusual characteristics of 3I/ATLAS make it an important case study.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I/ATLAS, only two interstellar objects had been confirmed as entering the solar system: 'Oumuamua in 2017 and Comet Borisov in 2019. The study of these objects has provided valuable information about the materials and conditions beyond our solar system.</p>

<p>The interest surrounding 3I/ATLAS reflects ongoing curiosity about interstellar phenomena and the potential for discovering more about the universe's composition and dynamics.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS completes its flyby, astronomers will continue to gather data and observations to better understand its behaviour and characteristics. Researchers hope to gain insights that could inform future studies of interstellar objects.</p>
