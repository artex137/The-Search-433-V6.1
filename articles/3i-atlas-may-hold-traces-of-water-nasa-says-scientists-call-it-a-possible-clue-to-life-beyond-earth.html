      <h2>3I/Atlas may hold traces of water, NASA says - scientists call it a possible clue to life beyond Earth</h2>

<p>NASA scientists have discovered signs of water molecules on the surface of the interstellar object 3I/Atlas, which is currently passing through our solar system. This finding, announced on October 24, 2023, could provide a significant clue in the search for life beyond Earth.</p>

<p>The detection of water is important as it suggests that interstellar objects may carry essential materials for life. NASA's advanced telescopes and spectrometers have identified what they describe as the "fingerprint of water" on 3I/Atlas. This observation may help researchers understand how water and organic materials are transported across the galaxy.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovery announced on October 24, 2023.</li>
    <li>3I/Atlas is the third known interstellar object detected, following 'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019.</li>
    <li>3I/Atlas is about the size of a small asteroid.</li>
    <li>The object is moving in a hyperbolic trajectory, indicating a one-time pass through the solar system.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas entered the solar system earlier this year and has been under close observation since its arrival. NASA scientists have utilized advanced instruments to analyze the object and have recently confirmed the presence of water molecules.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The presence of water molecules alone is not enough to suggest biological activity,” NASA scientists said. “However, it does support the theory that comets, asteroids, and interstellar objects may carry essential materials to different worlds.”
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This discovery builds on previous findings related to interstellar objects, which have provided rare insights into materials from other star systems. The hypothesis known as panspermia suggests that life's building blocks could be spread between planets and star systems, making this finding on 3I/Atlas a critical piece of the puzzle.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to monitor 3I/Atlas as it travels through the solar system. Future analyses using the James Webb Space Telescope and other observatories will aim to determine the form of the water detected—whether it exists as ice, locked in minerals, or mixed with dust. This research will enhance our understanding of how such materials can survive long journeys through space.</p>
