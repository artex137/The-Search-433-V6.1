      <h2>NASA’s silence on comet 3I/ATLAS puzzles scientists around the world</h2>

<p>The comet 3I/ATLAS, detected on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile, has raised questions among scientists due to NASA's limited data disclosures. The comet is the third interstellar object confirmed in the Solar System and is currently being analyzed by global astronomers for its unusual chemical composition. The comet is expected to reach perihelion on October 30, 2025, at a distance of 1.4 astronomical units from the Sun, near Mars' orbit.</p>

<p>This situation is significant because the comet's elevated carbon dioxide levels challenge traditional theories of comet formation. NASA has restricted data sharing due to budgetary constraints related to the U.S. government shutdown, which has hindered collaboration with the European Space Agency (ESA) and independent observatories. The unique properties of 3I/ATLAS provide a rare opportunity to study processes in distant stellar systems.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS detected on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>Perihelion is expected on October 30, 2025, at 1.4 astronomical units from the Sun.</li>
    <li>The comet travels at approximately 220,000 km/h.</li>
    <li>Nucleus estimated between 300 meters and 5.6 km in diameter, with over 8% active surface.</li>
    <li>NASA's Swift Telescope captured ultraviolet emissions in July and August 2025.</li>
    <li>Cometary activity began in May 2025 at 6.4 astronomical units from the Sun.</li>
    <li>Observations confirmed a hyperbolic trajectory with no significant gravitational deviations.</li>
    <li>Ground telescopes will track 3I/ATLAS until solar conjunction on October 21, 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the ATLAS telescope in Chile detected the comet 3I/ATLAS. Shortly after its discovery, astronomers noted its unusual chemical composition, particularly the high levels of carbon dioxide. By May 2025, cometary activity had commenced at a distance of 6.4 astronomical units from the Sun.</p>

<p>In August 2025, data from the James Webb Space Telescope confirmed the presence of carbon monoxide and water vapor. The ESA contributed additional data from the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter on October 3, 2025, enhancing the global observation efforts.</p>

<p>NASA's restrictions on data sharing due to the U.S. government shutdown have necessitated increased collaboration with international partners. Observations continued until solar conjunction on October 21, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This object represents a message from another planetary system, offering insights into interstellar chemistry and distant world formation,” said a representative from the European Space Agency.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS follows previous interstellar objects, including 2I/Borisov, which also provided unique opportunities for scientific study. The ongoing U.S. government shutdown has impacted NASA's ability to share data, prompting reliance on international collaborations to gather information on the comet.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The comet will reappear in December 2025, with visibility limited to professional equipment due to its apparent magnitude above 12. Continuous monitoring and data collection will be essential to understand the implications of 3I/ATLAS for our knowledge of the Solar System and beyond.</p>
