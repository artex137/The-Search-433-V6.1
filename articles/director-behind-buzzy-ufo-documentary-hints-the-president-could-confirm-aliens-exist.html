      <h2>Director hints at potential alien confirmation from U.S. president</h2>
<p>Dan Farah, director of the documentary <em>The Age of Disclosure</em>, has suggested that the president of the United States could soon confirm the existence of aliens. The film, which explores a purported government cover-up of non-human intelligence, premieres in select theaters and on Amazon Prime streaming on Friday.</p>

<p>This development matters as it highlights ongoing discussions regarding Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs), the formal term for UFOs, and the government's transparency on the subject. Farah's documentary includes insights from 34 U.S. government insiders, including military and intelligence officials, and aims to shed light on an alleged 80-year cover-up.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The documentary <em>The Age of Disclosure</em> premieres on Friday.</li>
    <li>Dan Farah has spoken with 34 U.S. government insiders about UAPs.</li>
    <li>Farah claims that former President Trump is aware of the film's contents.</li>
    <li>Congress has held multiple meetings regarding UAPs.</li>
    <li>Florida Rep. Anna Paulina Luna has called for increased transparency on UAPs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2024, Trump stated he was not a believer in extraterrestrial life but acknowledged meeting credible individuals who report sightings of unusual aerial phenomena. By September 2024, he expressed willingness to release additional UAP footage when asked by a podcaster. In October 2024, he discussed the potential for life on Mars, indicating a softening stance on the subject.</p>

<p>In September 2024, Congress, led by Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, began advocating for increased transparency regarding UAP research and government knowledge on the matter. The discussions have focused on ensuring the American public is informed about any potential threats posed by UAPs.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “UAPs are real, they’re here, and they’re not human,” a former senior CIA official stated in the documentary trailer.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “The American people deserve maximum transparency from the federal government on sightings, acquisitions, and examinations of UAPs,” said Rep. Anna Paulina Luna.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “For too long, the public has blatantly been lied to, kept in the dark, and misled,” Farah said regarding government transparency.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>UAPs have gained increasing attention in recent years, with Congress holding hearings and discussions aimed at understanding potential national security implications. The government’s previous secrecy on the topic has led to public outcry for more information.</p>

<p>Farah’s documentary aims to address these concerns and hopes to prompt the government to disclose more information about UAPs and non-human intelligence.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following the film’s release, Farah hopes it will lead to further government disclosures regarding UAPs. The White House has been approached for comments on the claims made in the documentary.</p>
