      <h2>Director behind UFO documentary hints at presidential confirmation of alien life</h2>

<p>Dan Farah, director of the documentary <em>The Age of Disclosure</em>, has suggested that the president of the United States may soon confirm the existence of extraterrestrial life. The film, which claims to expose a decades-long government cover-up of non-human intelligence, premieres in select theaters and on Amazon Prime this Friday.</p>

<p>This development matters as it highlights ongoing discussions about the government’s transparency regarding Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs), the formal term for UFOs. Farah has interviewed 34 U.S. government insiders, including military and intelligence officials, about an 80-year cover-up related to non-human intelligent life and technological advancements.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Film title:</strong> The Age of Disclosure</li>
    <li><strong>Director:</strong> Dan Farah</li>
    <li><strong>Release date:</strong> Friday, not disclosed</li>
    <li><strong>Number of interviews:</strong> 34 U.S. government insiders</li>
    <li><strong>Key figures mentioned:</strong> Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, James Clapper</li>
    <li><strong>Focus of discussion:</strong> Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Farah has stated that the film reveals insights from various government insiders about the existence of non-human intelligence and the government's efforts to reverse-engineer advanced technology. Following the film's completion, he mentioned that former President Donald Trump has shown interest in the subject.</p>
<p>In several interviews, Trump has expressed curiosity about extraterrestrial life and indicated intentions to declassify government information on the topic. Florida GOP Rep. Anna Paulina Luna has also called for greater transparency regarding UAPs in Congress.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I think it's only a matter of time before the release of this film is followed by a sitting president stepping to the podium and telling the world, 'We're not alone in the universe,'” said Dan Farah.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The American people deserve maximum transparency from the federal government on sightings, acquisitions, and examinations of UAPs,” stated Rep. Anna Paulina Luna.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>In recent years, discussions about UAPs have gained momentum, with Congress holding multiple meetings on the subject. The government’s work with UAPs has become a focal point for lawmakers, who urge increased transparency and public awareness.</p>
<p>Farah emphasized the need for the government to disclose relevant information, arguing that the public has been misled for too long.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the film releases, Farah hopes it will prompt the government to make more information public regarding UAPs and non-human intelligence. The ongoing dialogue about transparency in government will likely continue to evolve in the coming months.</p>
