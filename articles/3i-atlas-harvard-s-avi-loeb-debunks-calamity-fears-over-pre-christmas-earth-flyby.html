      <h2>3I/ATLAS: Harvard's Avi Loeb Debunks Calamity Fears Over Pre-Christmas Earth Flyby</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has addressed concerns regarding comet 3I/ATLAS ahead of its closest approach to Earth on 29 October, stating that the object poses no threat to humanity. Loeb's comments come as speculation about the comet's potential risks has circulated among both amateur and professional astronomers.</p>

<p>Loeb has argued that while some have framed 3I/ATLAS as a possible 'black swan event'—a term for unforeseen occurrences with significant consequences—authorities, including NASA, have confirmed that the comet's trajectory will keep it a safe distance away from Earth. The comet is expected to pass at a distance of approximately 1.8 astronomical units, which is well beyond any impact risk.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach date:</strong> 29 October 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Closest distance to Earth:</strong> 1.8 astronomical units</li>
    <li><strong>NASA's position:</strong> No impact threat from the comet</li>
    <li><strong>Avi Loeb's hypothesis:</strong> Potential for 'alien probes' but low probability of threat</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In the weeks leading up to the 29 October flyby, Loeb has raised questions about the nature of 3I/ATLAS, suggesting it could be more than just a comet. His statements have sparked discussions about the readiness of humanity to face potential cosmic threats.</p>

<p>As 3I/ATLAS approached the inner Solar System, NASA released images of the comet. Some observers criticized the images for being too fuzzy, leading to increased speculation about the comet's origins and characteristics.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "It doesn't look like 3I/ATLAS is manoeuvring towards any particular planet, and mainly gravity shapes its trajectory." 
    — Avi Loeb
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    "The comet poses no impact threat, stressing that its trajectory keeps it well outside any dangerous zone." 
    — NASA
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object to enter the Solar System, following 1I/‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. As such, its behaviour is closely monitored by the scientific community. Previous interstellar visitors have also sparked debate about the potential for extraterrestrial technology.</p>

<p>Loeb has previously suggested that humanity should be more open-minded about the possibilities of extraterrestrial life and technology, framing 3I/ATLAS as a case study for such discussions.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its trajectory, scientists will monitor its behaviour for any unusual phenomena. Loeb has requested that NASA examine data from Mars rovers and orbiters for potential artificial signals or objects that may be associated with the comet.</p>
