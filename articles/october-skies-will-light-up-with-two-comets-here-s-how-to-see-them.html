      <h2>October skies will light up with two comets</h2>

<p>Skywatchers can look forward to spotting two comets, C/2025 R2 (SWAN) and C/2025 A6 (Lemmon), in October. Both comets are expected to make their closest approach to Earth around October 21. They will be best viewed with binoculars in the night sky approximately 45 minutes after sunset.</p>

<p>The visibility of these comets is significant as they provide a rare opportunity for enthusiasts and casual observers alike. Authorities and astronomers are encouraging the public to take advantage of this event, as seeing multiple comets in a month is uncommon.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comets:</strong> C/2025 R2 (SWAN) and C/2025 A6 (Lemmon)</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach:</strong> October 21, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Best viewing time:</strong> 45 minutes after sunset</li>
    <li><strong>Brightness of SWAN:</strong> Estimated at magnitude +6.1</li>
    <li><strong>Brightness of Lemmon:</strong> Expected to reach magnitude +5 in mid-October and November</li>
    <li><strong>Viewing locations:</strong> Western and southern skies</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet C/2025 R2 (SWAN) has been gradually increasing in visibility since early October. It is expected to be visible to the unaided eye on October 20. Comet C/2025 A6 (Lemmon) will be more prominent later in the month, particularly at the end of October.</p>

<p>Both comets are remnants from the early solar system, composed mainly of ice and dark organic material. Observers are advised to use binoculars or telescopes for optimal viewing.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Comets are remnants from the early stages of our solar system about 4.6 billion years ago,” NASA has stated.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Comets typically brighten considerably close to perihelion, or a comet's closest point to Earth,” according to StarWalk.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Seeing two comets in one month is a rare occurrence for skywatchers. Comet C/2025 R2 (SWAN) is expected to shine brightly through mid-October, while Comet C/2025 A6 (Lemmon) will follow with increased visibility as it approaches Earth.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Skywatchers are encouraged to prepare for optimal viewing conditions. Astronomers will continue to monitor the brightness and trajectory of both comets as October progresses.</p>
