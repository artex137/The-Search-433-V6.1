      <h2>Witnesses to testify about UFOs today. What's happened since last UAP hearing in Congress?</h2>

<p>Congress is set to hear testimony today about unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) during a hearing scheduled for 10 a.m. ET. This marks the third congressional hearing on UFOs in as many years, following a significant session in November 2024. Four new witnesses will testify under oath about their experiences and knowledge of UAP.</p>

<p>This hearing is significant as it reflects ongoing government efforts to promote transparency regarding UAP. Representative Anna Paulina Luna, R-Florida, chairs the Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets, which was established in February 2025. This task force aims to address concerns about government secrecy and promote public understanding of UAP.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Hearing date: Tuesday, September 9, 2025</li>
    <li>Time: 10 a.m. ET</li>
    <li>Witnesses: Four new individuals testifying under oath</li>
    <li>Previous hearing: November 14, 2024</li>
    <li>Key witness from November: Luis Elizondo, former military intelligence official</li>
    <li>Agency: All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In November 2024, Congress held a hearing where four witnesses provided testimony about UAP, describing encounters with strange craft that outperformed U.S. military technology. Luis Elizondo criticized the intelligence community for excessive secrecy surrounding UAP reports.</p>
<p>On November 19, 2024, Jon T. Kosloski, director of AARO, testified in a Senate hearing, stating that there was no verifiable evidence of extraterrestrial activity. This followed the release of records related to UFOs by the National Archives in April 2025, mandated by an annual defense policy bill.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "I believe we as Americans can handle the truth, and I also believe the world deserves the truth," said Luis Elizondo during the November 2024 hearing.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    Jon T. Kosloski stated, "The office has not discovered any verifiable evidence of extraterrestrial beings, activity, or technology."
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interest in UAP has surged in recent years, with nearly half of Americans believing that the U.S. government is hiding information about UFOs. The shift from the term UFO to UAP reflects a desire to reframe the conversation around these phenomena. Previous hearings have highlighted concerns about government transparency and the potential implications for national security.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following today's hearing, the Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets is expected to continue its work in promoting transparency regarding UAP. Future investigations and additional hearings may be scheduled as Congress seeks to address public concerns and gather more information on these phenomena.</p>
