      <h2>Witnesses to testify about UFOs today. What's happened since last UAP hearing in Congress?</h2>

<p>On September 9, 2025, Congress will hold a hearing featuring public testimony from four witnesses regarding unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), commonly known as UFOs. This session marks the third congressional hearing on the topic in three years, following a notable hearing in July 2023 that renewed public interest in UAPs.</p>

<p>This hearing is significant as it reflects ongoing government efforts to address public concerns about UFOs and transparency surrounding the investigation of these phenomena. The Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets, led by Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Florida, aims to promote openness regarding government activities related to UAPs.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Hearing scheduled for September 9, 2025, at 10 a.m. ET.</li>
    <li>Four witnesses will testify under oath.</li>
    <li>This is the third congressional hearing on UFOs since July 2023.</li>
    <li>The Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets was established in February 2025.</li>
    <li>Previous hearing occurred on November 14, 2023.</li>
    <li>The All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) has not found evidence of extraterrestrial technology.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In November 2023, four witnesses testified about UAPs, claiming these craft outmaneuver U.S. military aircraft. Luis Elizondo, a former military intelligence official, criticized the government's secrecy regarding UAPs, stating it conceals the knowledge that humanity is not alone in the universe.</p>

<p>Days later, Jon T. Kosloski, director of the AARO, testified that the agency has found no verifiable evidence of extraterrestrial activity. This testimony followed the release of records related to UFOs by the National Archives in late April 2025.</p>

<p>On May 1, 2025, an informal roundtable discussion occurred, featuring experts in science, defense, and technology, to explore the implications of UAPs for national security and scientific advancement.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I believe we as Americans can handle the truth, and I also believe the world deserves the truth,” said Luis Elizondo during the November 2023 hearing.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Jon T. Kosloski stated in November 2023, “The office has not discovered any verifiable evidence of extraterrestrial beings, activity, or technology.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>There has been a resurgence of interest in UFOs over the past few years, with nearly half of Americans believing the government is withholding information about these phenomena. The rebranding of UFOs to UAPs has not diminished public fascination, which continues to grow as Congress holds more hearings.</p>

<p>The establishment of the Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets indicates a commitment to greater transparency regarding UAP investigations and government activities related to these phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The upcoming hearing will provide further insights into government investigations of UAPs and the testimonies of new witnesses. The Task Force aims to continue its efforts toward transparency in the coming months.</p>
