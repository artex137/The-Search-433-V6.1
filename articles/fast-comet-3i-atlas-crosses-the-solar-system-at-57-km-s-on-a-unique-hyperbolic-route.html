      <p class="byline">Published 2025-12-20 04:57 UTC</p>

      <h2>Fast comet 3I/Atlas crosses the solar system at 57 km/s on a unique hyperbolic route</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/Atlas is currently traveling through the solar system at a speed of 57 kilometers per second. Astronomers have confirmed its hyperbolic trajectory and interstellar origins, marking a significant event for astrophysics. The comet is expected to pass close to the Sun, providing a valuable opportunity to study materials from outside our solar system.</p>

<p>This encounter is important because it offers insights into the formation of planets and the composition of other regions in the Milky Way. Authorities are closely monitoring the comet's path using advanced telescopic observations, as it reinforces the idea that interstellar space is populated by fragments ejected from distant star systems.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> 57 km/s</li>
    <li><strong>Comet name:</strong> 3I/Atlas</li>
    <li><strong>First detected:</strong> December 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Notable predecessors:</strong> 1I/Oumuamua (2017), 2I/Borisov (2019)</li>
    <li><strong>Trajectory type:</strong> Hyperbolic</li>
    <li><strong>Gravitational effect:</strong> Cannot be captured by the Sun</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas has been tracked as it entered the solar system, with its speed and trajectory closely monitored by various observatories. The comet's closest approach to the Sun is currently being calculated, and the gravitational interaction with the Sun is expected to last a few weeks.</p>
<p>As it travels, scientists are utilizing complex computational models to simulate the gravitational slingshot effect exerted by the Sun on the comet, detailing changes in its route.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The detection of 3I/Atlas enhances our understanding of galactic dynamics and the diversity of celestial bodies that transit between stars,” said a spokesperson from the International Astronomical Union.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas is the third confirmed interstellar object to pass through our solar system, following 1I/Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Each of these encounters has provided valuable data that enriches the scientific community's understanding of celestial mechanics and the characteristics of objects from outside our solar system.</p>
<p>The unique speed of 3I/Atlas differentiates it from its predecessors, with Oumuamua and Borisov traveling at 26 km/s and 33 km/s, respectively. This high velocity indicates its external origin and provides clues about its formation history.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Observatories will continue to track 3I/Atlas as it moves away from the Sun and back into interstellar space. Ongoing analysis of its chemical composition will further confirm its origins and enhance understanding of the materials found in distant star systems.</p>
