      <h2>Starshield’s Signals Raise Alarm as 3I/ATLAS Emerges from Behind the Sun</h2>

<p>Washington, DC – A constellation of classified defense satellites, part of SpaceX’s Starshield program, has been transmitting signals on radio bands designated for uplinks. This activity, first detected by Canadian amateur satellite tracker Scott Tilley, raises concerns about potential interference with astronomical observations of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, which is expected to re-emerge from behind the Sun in early December 2025.</p>

<p>The unusual transmissions could disrupt sensitive scientific instruments as astronomers calibrate their telescopes to capture data from 3I/ATLAS. The National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), which operates the Starshield network, has not commented on the situation, nor has Elon Musk. The signals have sparked discussions about regulatory oversight and national security following reports from NPR confirming the frequencies involved.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Transmissions detected between 2025 and 2110 MHz.</li>
    <li>Signals have been transmitted since mid-2024 from over 170 satellites.</li>
    <li>First detected by Scott Tilley in British Columbia.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will reach its closest point to the Sun in late October 2025.</li>
    <li>Observatories are calibrating telescopes for observations in November and December.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Since mid-2024, the Starshield program has launched eleven missions, placing over 170 satellites into orbit. In October 2025, Tilley detected the unusual signals while scanning radio frequencies. The discovery coincides with the upcoming observations of 3I/ATLAS, which is expected to provide unique data about interstellar objects.</p>

<p>The signals have raised alarms as astronomers prepare for critical observations that require radio-quiet conditions. Past incidents of radio interference have forced astronomers to discard important data, raising the stakes for this event.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It was just a clumsy move at the keyboard,” Tilley said about his discovery. “All of a sudden I’m looking at the wrong antenna, the wrong band… I hit the record button and let it run.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>In the past decade, astronomers have faced significant challenges due to radio interference from satellite networks. Such disruptions have led to delays and cancellations of critical observations, impacting research in the field. The current situation with Starshield highlights ongoing concerns about the balance between national security operations and scientific research.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The scientific community is closely monitoring the situation as they prepare for observations of 3I/ATLAS. Any confirmed interference from Starshield could lead to significant loss of data and insights into the interstellar object.</p>
