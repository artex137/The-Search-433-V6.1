      <h2>NASA speaks out with new images of bizarre comet 3I/ATLAS heading towards Earth at 250,000 kmp/h</h2>

<p>NASA has released new images of comet 3I/ATLAS, which is currently travelling through our solar system at approximately 250,000 kilometers per hour. The comet was recently observed after reemerging from behind the Sun, and it is set to make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of 170 million miles (274 million kilometers).</p>

<p>This observation is significant as 3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object to enter our solar system. NASA has initiated a comprehensive observation campaign, deploying its spacecraft and telescopes to track the comet's trajectory. The agency aims to gather as much data as possible before the comet's closest encounter with Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is travelling at approximately 250,000 kilometers per hour.</li>
    <li>The closest approach to Earth is predicted for December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will pass within 170 million miles (274 million kilometers) of Earth.</li>
    <li>Nasa has utilized twelve assets to capture images of the comet since its discovery on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>The European Space Agency's 'Juice' spacecraft is currently limited in its data collection due to its proximity to the Sun.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first discovered on July 1, 2025. NASA has since implemented an extensive observation campaign involving multiple spacecraft and telescopes to monitor the comet's journey. The comet reemerged from behind the Sun recently, allowing for new images to be captured.</p>
<p>As the comet approaches Earth, it is expected to come closest on December 19, 2025. Following this, it will pass by Jupiter in the spring of 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "NASA is in the midst of an unprecedented solar system-wide observation campaign, turning its spacecraft and space telescopes to follow comet 3I/ATLAS," the agency stated. "Twelve NASA assets have captured and processed imagery of the comet since it was first discovered."
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable as the third interstellar object observed in our solar system. Previous interstellar objects have sparked interest and speculation regarding their origins and potential implications for Earth. The scientific community continues to debate the nature and origin of such objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth. Further imaging and data collection are expected, particularly as the comet nears its closest point to Earth in December.</p>
