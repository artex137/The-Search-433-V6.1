      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS’ Predecessors, 1I/ʻOumuamua, and 2I/Borisov: A Comparison of the Only 3 Interstellar Objects</h2>

<p>The discovery of Comet 3I/ATLAS has marked a significant milestone in astronomy as the third confirmed interstellar object detected in our solar system. 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Chile. It follows the earlier detections of 1I/ʻOumuamua in October 2017 and 2I/Borisov in August 2019.</p>

<p>This discovery is important as it provides insights into the composition and dynamics of material from beyond our solar system. The detection of these interstellar objects allows scientists to enhance their understanding of cosmic materials and their interactions with the solar system. Authorities and researchers are now focused on studying 3I/ATLAS to gain further knowledge about its characteristics and potential impacts.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> July 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery Agency:</strong> Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS)</li>
    <li><strong>Location of Discovery:</strong> Chile</li>
    <li><strong>Predecessor Objects:</strong> 1I/ʻOumuamua (2017), 2I/Borisov (2019)</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to Earth:</strong> 27 million km (October 2025)</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> ~130,000 mph</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In October 2017, 1I/ʻOumuamua was detected by the Pan-STARRS telescope in Hawaii, marking the first known interstellar object. It was identified due to its elongated shape and hyperbolic trajectory, confirming its origin outside the solar system.</p>

<p>In August 2019, 2I/Borisov was observed by amateur astronomer Gennadiy Borisov in Crimea. This comet provided the first opportunity to study an interstellar comet’s composition directly, as it resembled solar-system comets while traveling at interstellar speeds.</p>

<p>In July 2025, 3I/ATLAS was discovered in Chile. Unlike its predecessors, 3I/ATLAS is a comet with a visible coma and tail, offering a rare chance to study interstellar ice and dust.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS offers a chance to study interstellar dust and volatile compounds in real-time,” said a lead researcher from ATLAS. “Its passage near Mars in October 2025 allows for detailed observation.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The detection of interstellar objects has opened discussions about the nature of materials from outside our solar system. 1I/ʻOumuamua's unusual shape and acceleration raised debates about non-gravitational forces, while 2I/Borisov confirmed similarities in comet formation across star systems. The discoveries highlight the diversity and significance of interstellar visitors.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to observe 3I/ATLAS closely as it approaches Mars in October 2025. They aim to gather data on its trajectory and chemical makeup, which may lead to insights into interstellar material and potential meteor showers if Earth intersects its debris.</p>
