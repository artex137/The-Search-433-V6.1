      <h2>UFO Appears To Hover Over Active Volcano Before Disappearing In Viral Video</h2>

<p>Alien enthusiasts have reacted with excitement after a video appears to show an unidentified flying object (UFO) hovering over the active Popocatepetl volcano in Mexico in late October. The glowing object seemingly flies over the volcano, which is located between the states of Morelos and Puebla, before zooming away at high speed and disappearing. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This incident is significant as it has sparked renewed interest in UFO sightings, particularly in relation to active geological sites. At this time, officials have not commented on the origin of the UFO, which has led to various theories among experts and enthusiasts alike.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Incident occurred in late October 2023.</li>
    <li>Location: Popocatepetl volcano, Morelos and Puebla, Mexico.</li>
    <li>Volcano altitude: 5,426 meters (17,801 feet).</li>
    <li>Reported eruptions: 19 low-intensity eruptions on the same day as the sighting.</li>
    <li>Public exclusion zone: 11.3 kilometers (7 miles) from the crater advised by the National Center for Disaster Preparedness (NCDP).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In late October 2023, surveillance cameras captured footage of a glowing object hovering over the Popocatepetl volcano. The volcano was experiencing activity, with 19 low-intensity eruptions reported on the same day. The NCDP advised the public to maintain a safe distance from the crater, establishing an exclusion zone of 7 miles.</p>

<p>As the video gained traction online, UFO expert Jaime Maussan suggested that the volcano could serve as an “interdimensional portal,” allowing extraterrestrial beings to traverse between locations. He cited scientific findings regarding magnetic storms beneath the volcano as evidence of this phenomenon.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“No object made by man can go into a volcano because of the hot temperatures reaching around 1,832 °F,” said Jaime Maussan, a UFO expert.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The University of Bergen in Norway discovered that under the volcano there are magnetic storms necessary to be able to generate X-points — or regions of electron diffusion — and be used to create a Dimensional Portal,” Maussan added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Popocatepetl volcano is one of the most active volcanoes in Mexico, frequently monitored for eruptions and geological activity. Previous UFO sightings near geological formations have often led to speculation about extraterrestrial connections, particularly in regions known for volcanic activity.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities have not disclosed any plans for an investigation into the UFO sighting. The NCDP continues to monitor volcanic activity and maintain the exclusion zone for public safety.</p>
