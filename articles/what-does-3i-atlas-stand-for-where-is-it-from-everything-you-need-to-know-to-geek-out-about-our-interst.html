      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS: A Rare Interstellar Visitor</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, a rare interstellar object, has been detected by astronomers after its discovery on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey telescope. It is only the third confirmed interstellar object ever found, following Ê»Oumuamua in 2017 and Comet Borisov in 2019. 3I/ATLAS is currently on a hyperbolic orbit and will exit the Solar System permanently after its closest approach to the Sun on October 30, 2025.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant for astronomers as it provides a unique opportunity to study material from beyond our solar system. Observatories worldwide are preparing to observe this fleeting visitor, which will not return once it leaves.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovered:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to the Sun:</strong> October 30, 2025, at approximately 1.35 AU</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to Earth:</strong> Mid-December 2025, at about 1.8 AU</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Approximately 61 km/s</li>
    <li><strong>Brightness:</strong> Magnitude 12–14, not visible to the naked eye</li>
    <li><strong>Coma composition:</strong> Carbon dioxide, hydrogen cyanide, and atomic nickel</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS began its journey light-years away, moving at an extraordinary speed. Its discovery prompted immediate interest due to its hyperbolic trajectory, confirming it as an interstellar object. Follow-up observations indicated that it would pass through the inner Solar System once before heading back into interstellar space.</p>
<p>The comet's perihelion, or closest approach to the Sun, is set for October 30, 2025. Observers are planning to document its passage, with spacecraft near Mars and Jupiter positioned to capture the event. By mid-November 2025, it will become visible in the pre-dawn sky for a brief period.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS is not just a spectacle of cosmic beauty but a scientific treasure carrying ancient material formed around distant stars.” – Astronomer</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is the third interstellar object confirmed to have entered the Solar System, following Ê»Oumuamua and Comet Borisov. The study of such objects helps scientists understand the formation and evolution of planetary systems beyond our own.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Observatories will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS until it departs the Solar System. Astronomers will analyze the data collected to gain insights into its origin and composition, marking a significant step forward in the study of interstellar objects.</p>
