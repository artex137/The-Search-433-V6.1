      <h2>NASA-backed researchers launch planetary defense probe to shield Earth from massive interstellar object</h2>

<p>A NASA-backed planetary defense group has begun efforts to locate comet <strong>3I/ATLAS</strong>, observed emitting an alloy not seen in nature. The comet, which is the size of Manhattan, has been added to the list of threats by the <strong>International Asteroid Warning Network</strong> (IAWN), a coalition that monitors potentially hazardous asteroids and Near-Earth Objects (NEOs). There have been no reported injuries or fatalities.</p>

<p>This initiative is significant because it marks the first time an interstellar object has been targeted by IAWN campaigns. Researchers aim to refine their detection skills and prepare for any potential threats from space. The comet was first photographed by the <strong>Hubble Telescope</strong> on July 21, 2025, and has displayed unusual characteristics that challenge typical comet behavior.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Size:</strong> Approximately 28 miles (45 km) across</li>
    <li><strong>First Observed:</strong> July 21, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Emission Rate:</strong> Four grams of nickel per second</li>
    <li><strong>Campaign Dates:</strong> November 27, 2025, to January 27, 2026</li>
    <li><strong>IAWN Purpose:</strong> To detect and monitor hazardous celestial objects</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 21, 2025, the <strong>Hubble Telescope</strong> first photographed comet 3I/ATLAS, revealing its unusual characteristics. Shortly after, the IAWN added the comet to its list of potential threats due to its peculiar behavior, including an anti-tail and the emission of an alloy, nickel tetracarbonyl. In response, IAWN announced a comet campaign scheduled from November 27, 2025, through January 27, 2026, aimed at improving detection techniques.</p>

<p>Preparations for the campaign include a workshop on comet astrometry, which will help researchers measure the comet's exact location. This drill is being treated as an opportunity for stargazers rather than a direct call to enact planetary defenses.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“To prepare for the campaign, we will hold a workshop on techniques to correctly measure comet astrometry,” IAWN representatives stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The detection of 3I/ATLAS is notable as it is the first interstellar object targeted by IAWN. Previous incidents of unusual celestial objects have prompted discussions within the scientific community regarding the need for improved monitoring and defense strategies against potential threats from space.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>IAWN will conduct the comet campaign as planned, focusing on refining detection methods. Researchers will continue to analyze 3I/ATLAS’s trajectory and behavior as it approaches the Sun, with further studies anticipated to assess its nature and any potential implications for Earth.</p>
