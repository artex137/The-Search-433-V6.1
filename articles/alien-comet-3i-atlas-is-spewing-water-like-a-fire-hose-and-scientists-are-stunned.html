      <h2>Alien Comet 3I/ATLAS Is Spewing Water Like a Fire Hose — And Scientists Are Stunned</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, discovered on July 1, 2025, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Chile, is releasing water vapor at an astonishing rate of 40 kilograms per second. This activity has been recorded at a distance of approximately 3 astronomical units from the Sun, making it a notable interstellar object.</p>

<p>The significance of 3I/ATLAS lies in its status as the third known interstellar object to enter our Solar System, following ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. NASA has described this comet as a “frozen relic” from a time long before our Solar System formed. Scientists are now closely monitoring its trajectory and composition to better understand the conditions that existed in the early galaxy.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered: July 1, 2025, in Chile.</li>
    <li>Distance from the Sun: ~3 astronomical units.</li>
    <li>Water vapor emission rate: 40 kg/s.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: ~1.8 AU (over 270 million km).</li>
    <li>Mass: Estimated at tens of billions of tons.</li>
    <li>Age: Estimated between 7 to 10 billion years old.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, 3I/ATLAS was first identified by the ATLAS telescope. Follow-up analyses confirmed its hyperbolic orbit, indicating it originated from outside the Solar System. The Minor Planet Center officially designated it as the third interstellar object found. In early October 2025, NASA’s Swift satellite detected hydroxyl gas in the comet's coma, confirming water vapor emissions.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“When the orbit of 3I/ATLAS is traced into the past, the comet clearly originates from outside our solar system,” said NASA. </blockquote>
<blockquote>ESA scientist Dr. Michael Küppers emphasized, “It looks like a comet and it behaves like a comet” with no signs of technology.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable for being the most “comet-like” interstellar object discovered so far. Previous interstellar visitors, such as ‘Oumuamua and Comet Borisov, exhibited different physical characteristics. This comet’s high carbon dioxide to water ratio suggests it formed in a distinct environment compared to its predecessors.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to observe 3I/ATLAS as it travels through the Solar System, analyzing its composition and trajectory for further insights into the early galaxy and the formation of planetary systems.</p>
