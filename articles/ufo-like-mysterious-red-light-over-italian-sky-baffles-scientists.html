      <h2>UFO-like mysterious red light over Italian sky baffles scientists</h2>

<p>A mysterious UFO-shaped red light has appeared in the sky over Possango, Italy, on November 17, 2025, at 10:45 local time. This phenomenon, which has now occurred for the second time in three years, has perplexed scientists and attracted the attention of conspiracy theorists, although no injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>The appearance of this red light is significant as experts investigate its cause. They have indicated that the phenomenon is likely not related to extraterrestrial life but is instead attributed to a lightning-related process known as ELVEs (emission of light and very low-frequency perturbations due to electromagnetic pulse sources). Scientists are working to understand the implications of this rare occurrence.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event date: November 17, 2025</li>
    <li>Location: Possango, Italy</li>
    <li>Time of observation: 10:45 local time</li>
    <li>Photographer: Valter Binotto</li>
    <li>Previous sightings: Similar phenomenon in 2023</li>
    <li>Duration of ELVE: One thousandth of a second</li>
    <li>Discovery of ELVE: Noted by NASA in 1990</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 17, 2025, at 10:45 local time, Valter Binotto captured a red light phenomenon in the sky over Possango. This event marks the second occurrence of such a sighting in three years, with a similar observation made in 2023.</p>

<p>Experts have stated that the red glow is due to a lightning-related process called ELVEs, which results from extremely powerful lightning bolts sending electromagnetic pulses that interact with the Earth's ionosphere.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    <p>“I select the frames where ELVE is visible from high-resolution video,” said photographer Valter Binotto, who used specialized equipment to capture the event.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The phenomenon of ELVEs is rare and was only discovered by NASA in 1990. Observing it twice over a small area, such as Possango, is considered nearly impossible, making this recent sighting noteworthy in the field of atmospheric science.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Experts continue to study the red light phenomenon and its causes, with further investigations planned to explore the implications of ELVEs and similar occurrences in the future.</p>
