      <h2>3I/ATLAS: The Object from Elsewhere Has Begun Seeding Our Solar System</h2>

<p>NASA's Neil Gehrels Swift Space Observatory has detected that the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is emitting hydroxyl gas as it passes through our Solar System. This observation, made at 2.9 astronomical units from the Sun, indicates that the comet is losing approximately 40 kilograms of water every second, a rate comparable to a powerful water jet.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it suggests that the internal composition of 3I/ATLAS differs fundamentally from that of comets native to our Solar System. Researchers hope to learn more about the distribution of prebiotic elements and the chemistry of life beyond Earth, as scientists believe this early outgassing could be caused by the warming of ice grains on the comet's surface due to solar radiation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is emitting hydroxyl gas.</li>
    <li>The comet is losing about 40 kilograms of water per second.</li>
    <li>Observations were made at 2.9 astronomical units from the Sun.</li>
    <li>This is the third recorded interstellar visitor, following 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov.</li>
    <li>The study was co-authored by Dennis Bodewits, a physics professor at Auburn University.</li>
    <li>Hydroxyl gas is a valuable indicator for detecting water in interstellar space.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been observed passing through our Solar System, with significant findings released recently by NASA's Neil Gehrels Swift Space Observatory. Preliminary studies from the James Webb Space Telescope had already indicated a high ratio of carbon dioxide to water. The latest research confirms the comet's unique chemical composition and its water activity.</p>

<p>Since its discovery, 3I/ATLAS has presented distinct characteristics compared to previous interstellar objects, such as its significant water release upon arrival.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>‚ÄúDetecting water in an interstellar comet is equivalent to receiving a chemical message from another planetary system,‚Äù said Dennis Bodewits, co-author of the study.</blockquote>

<blockquote>‚ÄúEvery interstellar object discovered so far has brought its share of surprises and changed our understanding of planet and comet formation processes around stars,‚Äù noted Zexi Xing, lead researcher of the study.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS follows 1I/'Oumuamua, which was discovered in 2017 and was relatively dry, and 2I/Borisov, which was rich in carbon monoxide and discovered in 2019. Each of these comets has exhibited unique characteristics, highlighting the diversity of interstellar objects and their formation environments in our Galaxy.</p>

<p>The detection of hydroxyl gas is a crucial advancement in astronomers' ability to study celestial bodies, allowing for indirect detection of water and insights into the photochemical processes occurring in space.</p>

<h2>What‚Äôs next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to study 3I/ATLAS to further understand its composition and the implications for the chemistry of life beyond Earth. The ongoing observations will help inform future studies of interstellar objects and their role in the evolution of planetary systems.</p>
