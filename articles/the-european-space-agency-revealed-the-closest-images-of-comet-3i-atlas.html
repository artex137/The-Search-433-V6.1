      <h2>The European Space Agency revealed the closest images of comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>The European Space Agency (ESA) has released the closest images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, captured by its ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) between October 1 and 7, 2025, while the spacecraft was approximately 400 kilometers from Mars. The images show the comet's core and surrounding coma, although details of the nucleus remain indistinct due to the distance.</p>

<p>This observation marks a significant advancement in the study of interstellar objects. The data collected has improved the accuracy of predicting 3I/ATLAS's trajectory, which is crucial for planetary defense efforts. The comet is expected to pass Earth on December 19, 2025, at a safe distance of about 270 million kilometers.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS first reported on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the comet occurred on October 3, 2025, at a distance of 29 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>The TGO camera improved image precision by ten times compared to ground-based telescopes.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will pass Earth on December 19, 2025, at 1.8 astronomical units.</li>
    <li>The comet is the third known interstellar object, after 1I/Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>July 1, 2025: Comet 3I/ATLAS is first reported.</p>
<p>October 1-7, 2025: The ExoMars TGO captures images of 3I/ATLAS, with the closest approach occurring on October 3.</p>
<p>October 7, 2025: ESA releases the images showing the comet's coma.</p>
<p>December 19, 2025: 3I/ATLAS is expected to pass Earth at a distance of approximately 270 million kilometers.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “We’ve just pinpointed the comet’s path with 10 times more accuracy, using data from our ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter spacecraft,” said the European Space Agency on Twitter.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is unique among interstellar comets due to its high speed and large size. The comet's characteristics differ from those of previous interstellar objects, prompting increased interest from the astronomical community. This event also serves as a valuable exercise for planetary defense, demonstrating the capability to detect and track space objects well before they approach Earth.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>ESA plans to continue monitoring 3I/ATLAS with its Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer spacecraft, aiming for optimal results in February 2026. The astronomical community is preparing for the comet's closest approach to Earth, which will provide an opportunity for in-depth analysis.</p>
