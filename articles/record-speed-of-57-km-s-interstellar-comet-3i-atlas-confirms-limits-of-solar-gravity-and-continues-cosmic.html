      <h2>Record speed of 57 km/s: interstellar comet 3I/Atlas confirms limits of solar gravity and continues cosmic journey</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/Atlas has crossed the Solar System at a speed of approximately <strong>57 km/s</strong>, significantly exceeding the Sun's local escape velocity. Discovered in July, 3I/Atlas is the third confirmed interstellar visitor, following a hyperbolic trajectory that guarantees its escape from the Solar System. The passage occurred in late October near the orbit of Mars, according to NASA and ESA, which closely monitored the comet's movement.</p>

<p>This discovery is important as it highlights the limits of solar gravity and the immense kinetic energy carried by bodies ejected from other star systems. The comet's hyperbolic trajectory means that while solar gravity slightly altered its path, it was unable to capture the comet in a closed orbit. This phenomenon offers a unique opportunity to study matter from other worlds.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Speed of 3I/Atlas: <strong>57 km/s</strong></li>
    <li>Discovered: July 2023</li>
    <li>Passage near Mars: Late October 2023</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth (perigee): Mid-December 2025</li>
    <li>Trajectory type: Hyperbolic</li>
    <li>Chemical composition: High ratio of carbon dioxide (CO2) to water</li>
    <li>Estimated age: Up to <strong>7 billion years</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2023, astronomers discovered the interstellar comet 3I/Atlas. It crossed the Solar System in late October 2023, passing near the orbit of Mars. Observations indicated that solar gravity acted only as a gravitational slingshot, altering the comet's path without capturing it. Researchers have since analyzed its trajectory and chemical composition, with findings suggesting a unique formation history.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The trajectory of 3I/Atlas confirms the limits of solar gravity and the power of kinetic energy in interstellar objects,” said a NASA spokesperson.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“This comet offers us a unique opportunity to study materials from outside our Solar System,” stated an ESA representative.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas is the third interstellar object confirmed to have entered the Solar System, following 1I/'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. The speed of 3I/Atlas, at 57 km/s, positions it as the fastest among these visitors. Previous studies of 'Oumuamua suggested unusual non-gravitational acceleration, raising questions about its nature.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to monitor 3I/Atlas as it moves through deep space. It is expected to be visible with observing equipment in mid-to-late November 2023, initially in the morning sky. The comet will cross Jupiter's orbit until March 2026, furthering our understanding of interstellar bodies.</p>
