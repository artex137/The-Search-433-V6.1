      <h2>IAWN uses interstellar object 3I/ATLAS as a test case for future comet exploration</h2>

<p>The United Nations’ International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) is monitoring interstellar object 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth, with its closest approach scheduled for December 19, 2025. The object will remain approximately <strong>270 million kilometres</strong> away from the planet during this event.</p>

<p>This campaign is significant as it marks the eighth IAWN observing exercise since 2017, aimed at improving future comet exploration and understanding of interstellar objects. The IAWN, a collaboration between the United Nations and NASA, has mobilized over 80 observatories worldwide to study 3I/ATLAS and enhance techniques for tracking comets and asteroids.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Closest approach:</strong> December 19, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Earth:</strong> ~270 million kilometres</li>
    <li><strong>Campaign start date:</strong> November 27, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Mid-campaign check-in:</strong> December 9, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Campaign closing date:</strong> February 3, 2026</li>
    <li><strong>First interstellar object studied:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The IAWN campaign to observe 3I/ATLAS commenced on November 27, 2025. A mid-campaign check-in occurred on December 9, 2025, to assess progress. As of December 15, 2025, the campaign is halfway through its planned research period, with observations expected to be published in a peer-reviewed journal in 2026.</p>

<p>According to James Bauer, one of the principal investigators for the IAWN campaign, the campaign represents a key opportunity to test new techniques in astrometry, which is crucial for measuring the positions of celestial objects.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The idea behind these campaigns is really to strengthen the technical capabilities for measuring sky positions, which we call astrometry, for asteroids and comets,” said James Bauer.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “We want the community to use the latest and greatest techniques,” Bauer added, emphasizing the importance of these observations for future comet exploration.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Since its inception in 2017, the IAWN has conducted various observational campaigns, including tracking asteroid Apophis in 2020 and 2021. The organization plans to set up new campaigns in 2027 and 2029 as Apophis is expected to make another approach towards Earth.</p>

<p>The study of 3I/ATLAS is particularly relevant as it behaves like a typical comet, providing insight into the characteristics of such objects despite its interstellar origin. This research will enhance the scientific community's understanding of comet behavior and improve future exploratory missions.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The IAWN will continue its research through February 3, 2026, with findings expected to be published in a peer-reviewed journal. The results will contribute to improving Earth’s monitoring capabilities of interstellar objects.</p>
