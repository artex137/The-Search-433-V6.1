      <h2>How to see rare comet tonight for last time in 1,300 years</h2>

<p>Comet C/2025 A6, also known as ‘Lemmon’, will be visible tonight, October 21, 2023, from various locations around the world, marking its first pass by Earth since the eighth century. This celestial event is significant as the comet will not return for another 1,300 years. No injuries or fatalities have been reported related to the comet's appearance.</p>

<p>The visibility of Comet Lemmon is a rare opportunity for stargazers. It is expected to come within 56 million miles of Earth this evening before heading towards the Sun on November 4, 2023. Dr. Robert Massey, deputy executive director of the Royal Astronomical Society, has urged the public to take advantage of this chance as it offers a unique spectacle not to be missed.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet C/2025 A6, known as ‘Lemmon’, will be visible tonight.</li>
    <li>It has not been seen since the eighth century and will not return until 3325.</li>
    <li>The comet will pass within 56 million miles of Earth.</li>
    <li>Best viewing time is between 7:00 PM and 8:00 PM.</li>
    <li>Dr. Robert Massey advises looking towards the western sky for optimal visibility.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet Lemmon was first observed in January 2023. Its trajectory brings it close to Earth tonight, October 21, 2023, before it heads towards the Sun on November 4, 2023.</p>

<p>As the comet approaches the Sun, its nucleus will melt, enhancing its visibility. Dr. Massey has noted this is an excellent time to view it, as it is expected to appear as a fuzzy object in the sky, visible to the naked eye or with binoculars.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Comet Lemmon is pretty much at its best visibility right now,” said Dr. Robert Massey, deputy executive director of the Royal Astronomical Society.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“It’s a reasonably bright comet as they go. The fact that you can see it easily with binoculars makes it fairly unusual, and for that reason alone it’s something to go and enjoy — particularly if you’ve never seen a comet before,” Massey added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet Lemmon is notable not only for its rarity but also for its brightness, which allows it to be viewed without advanced equipment. The upcoming visibility of another comet, 3I/ATLAS, has sparked interest due to its unusual trajectory and claims of being an alien ‘mothership’ by some observers.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>After its appearance tonight, Comet Lemmon will continue its path toward the Sun on November 4, 2023. Stargazers can look forward to the next significant comet, 3I/ATLAS, which is expected to be visible around November or December 2023.</p>
