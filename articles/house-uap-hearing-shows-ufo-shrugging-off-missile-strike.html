      <h2>House UAP Hearing Shows UFO Shrugging-Off Missile Strike</h2>

<p>A group of military whistleblowers testified under oath on Tuesday, September 9, 2025, during a House committee hearing on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs), where they accused the U.S. intelligence community of concealing encounters with UFOs. The hearing, chaired by Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., featured three Navy and Air Force veterans who presented a video showing a UFO being struck by a U.S. drone missile, which reportedly had no effect on the object.</p>

<p>This hearing marks the third congressional discussion on UAPs and highlights ongoing concerns regarding national security and government transparency. Representatives are pushing for accountability and a clearer understanding of unidentified aerial phenomena, as military encounters with these objects continue to be reported.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of hearing: September 9, 2025</li>
    <li>Location: House committee hearing on UAPs</li>
    <li>Video presented: UFO hit by a Hellfire missile on October 30, 2024</li>
    <li>Witnesses: Three Navy and Air Force veterans, including Jeffrey Nuccetelli</li>
    <li>Government agencies involved: U.S. military, intelligence community</li>
    <li>Reported UFO sightings in 2025: Over 2,000 incidents as per NUFORC</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 30, 2024, a U.S. military drone fired a Hellfire missile at a UFO off the coast of Yemen. The missile reportedly ricocheted off the object, which continued to move at high speed. On September 9, 2025, during a House committee hearing, witnesses testified about their encounters with various unexplained aerial phenomena.</p>

<p>Rep. Anna Paulina Luna opened the hearing by emphasizing the importance of transparency regarding UFO encounters. She stated that the issue is a matter of national security and accountability.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Today I was to state clearly, this is not science fiction or creative speculation. This is a national security, government accountability and the American people's right to the truth,” said Luna.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“There are servers where there is a whole bank of these kinds of videos that Congress hasn't been allowed to see, that the public hasn't been allowed to see,” said journalist George Knapp.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Trump administration has made efforts to increase transparency regarding UFOs, with an order issued in June to "restore American airspace sovereignty." This initiative includes recognizing the potential threat posed by UAPs and developing new drone detection technologies. The National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) reported over 2,000 UFO sightings in the first half of 2025, indicating a growing public interest and concern over these phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further investigations into UAP encounters are expected as Congress continues to seek accountability from the intelligence community. The White House's task force on UAPs will focus on enhancing airspace security and addressing public concerns about unidentified aerial phenomena.</p>
