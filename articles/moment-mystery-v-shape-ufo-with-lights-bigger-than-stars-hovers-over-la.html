      <h2>Moment mystery V-shape UFO with 'lights bigger than stars' hovers over LA</h2>

<p>A mysterious V-shaped unidentified flying object (UFO) hovered over a Los Angeles neighbourhood for approximately 30 minutes on an unspecified date, according to eyewitnesses. The UFO, described as "bigger than the stars," was filmed by two residents from their balcony as it illuminated the night sky before disappearing.</p>

<p>The footage has been submitted to the National UFO Reporting Centre (NUFORC), a nonprofit organization that has collected UFO reports since 1974. Authorities have not disclosed any further investigations or findings related to this incident as of yet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Location: Los Angeles, California</li>
    <li>Duration: Approximately 30 minutes</li>
    <li>Witnesses: Two residents</li>
    <li>Object description: V-shaped, black, with extremely bright lights</li>
    <li>Reported to: National UFO Reporting Centre (NUFORC)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Witnesses observed the UFO from their balcony, where they recorded its flight. The object lingered in the air, moving slightly before disappearing in a southern direction. The exact time of the sighting has not been disclosed.</p>

<p>The footage has since been shared with NUFORC, prompting discussions among UFO enthusiasts and researchers. The object has drawn comparisons to military aircraft, including the F-117 Nighthawk Stealth Fighter, although no official confirmation has been made regarding its identity.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“While sitting on my balcony, I saw a light in the sky bigger than stars usually appear. It moved around a little bit but didn't go too far. At the end, it just flew off in the south direction until I couldn't see it anymore,” said one of the witnesses.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This sighting follows a series of similar reports across the United States in 2023, with several individuals describing V-shaped or triangular objects with multiple lights. The recent release of declassified footage showing UFOs has heightened public interest in aerial phenomena.</p>

<p>Additionally, US intelligence officials, including Tulsi Gabbard, have indicated that they possess classified information about UFOs and have expressed a commitment to sharing more details with the public in the future.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the reported sighting have not been initiated as of now. The NUFORC continues to collect and analyze UFO reports, while public interest in the phenomenon remains high.</p>
