      <h2>Superbright Comet Lemmon Flies Through Auroras Over Scotland During Surprise Solar Storm</h2>

<p>Comet C/2025 A6 (Lemmon) has been photographed streaking through vibrant auroras in the Scottish Highlands on Saturday, October 18. The stunning image was captured by photographer Alan Tough from his backyard near Elgin, northeast Scotland, as a surprise geomagnetic storm illuminated the night sky.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it marks the closest approach of Comet Lemmon to Earth in over 1,000 years. The comet will reach its closest point to Earth today, October 21, when it will be approximately 56 million miles (90 million kilometers) away. Authorities and astronomers are closely monitoring the comet's trajectory and visibility, as its brightness has increased in recent weeks.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet Lemmon was photographed on October 18, 2023.</li>
    <li>Location: Near Elgin, northeast Scotland.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: October 21, 2023, at 56 million miles (90 million kilometers).</li>
    <li>Perihelion (closest point to the sun): November 8, 2023.</li>
    <li>Current apparent magnitude: 4, visible to the naked eye.</li>
    <li>Photographer: Alan Tough.</li>
    <li>Auroras resulted from a G2 (moderate) geomagnetic storm.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 18, 2023, Comet Lemmon was captured in a photograph during a surprise geomagnetic storm that produced vibrant auroras over Scotland. The storm was caused by a coronal mass ejection (CME) from the sun, which had been delayed from its predicted arrival. As the disturbance reached G2 status, auroras became visible across various regions.</p>

<p>Comet Lemmon was discovered on January 3, 2023, by researchers at the Mt. Lemmon SkyCenter in Arizona. It is a nonperiodic comet with an orbit estimated at approximately 1,350 years.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The auroras were a surprise, as we initially expected the solar storm to arrive two days earlier,” according to Spaceweather.com, which reported on the event.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet Lemmon's brightness has increased significantly in recent weeks due to its proximity to the sun, causing its coma to expand. The comet is currently visible in the northwestern sky shortly after sunset, located just below the Big Dipper. This event follows a series of notable astronomical occurrences, including the visibility of another bright comet, SWAN, which reached its closest point to Earth on October 20, 2023.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As Comet Lemmon approaches its closest point to Earth, astronomers will continue to observe its trajectory and brightness. The comet will reach its perihelion on November 8, 2023, and further observations are expected to provide insights into its characteristics and behaviour.</p>
