      <h2>Tim Pool pushes bizarre alien theory, says Trump's UFO order masks Iran strike</h2>

<p>Political commentator <strong>Tim Pool</strong> has speculated that President <strong>Donald Trump's</strong> reported instruction to declassify information on UFOs signals a potential U.S. strike on <strong>Iran</strong>. Pool made these comments during a livestream on <strong>February 20</strong> from <strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>.</p>

<p>Pool's theory raises questions about the timing of the UFO disclosure amidst ongoing geopolitical tensions. Authorities have not confirmed any connection between the declassification order and military actions involving Iran.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On February 20, 2023, Tim Pool addressed his audience during a livestream, connecting President Trump's order to declassify UFO information to a possible military conflict with Iran.

<p>During his commentary, Pool speculated on military strategies, emphasizing the need for stealth operations in a potential strike against Iran.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Everything you are seeing, it’s a manipulation for some reason. The government just doesn’t do things by accident,” Pool stated.</blockquote>
