      <h2>Harvard Scientist Warns Interstellar Object May Be Alien Tech</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has warned that the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS could represent evidence of alien technology. His comments were made during interviews with various media outlets as the object approaches Earth on December 19. There are no reports of injuries or fatalities related to this phenomenon.</p>

<p>Loeb's warnings highlight the importance of investigating unusual signals from space. He believes that overlooking these anomalies could prevent humanity from making a historic discovery. As the scientific community prepares for the object's close approach, Loeb has called for coordinated observations to understand its nature better.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Approaching Earth: December 19</li>
    <li>Key features: Non-gravitational acceleration, dust-and-gas jet pointed toward the Sun</li>
    <li>Past close encounters: Mars and Jupiter</li>
    <li>Recommendation: Coordinated observations and risk-scale system for interstellar objects</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Avi Loeb has expressed concerns about 3I/ATLAS's unusual characteristics, including its trajectory aligned with the solar system's planetary plane. He has noted that its dust-and-gas jet diverges from typical comet behavior by pointing toward the Sun.</p>

<p>Loeb has also conducted spectral analysis, revealing nickel emissions without corresponding iron, which contradicts standard comet composition. He warns that the object’s movement cannot be fully explained by conventional cometary physics.</p>

<p>As the object nears Earth, Loeb emphasizes the need for careful observation to determine whether it may have artificial origins.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“If 3I/ATLAS is artificial, we would fundamentally redefine not just astronomy, but civilisation itself,” said Loeb in an interview with the Hindustan Times.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“If we ignore anomalies, we would never expand our knowledge base ... quantum mechanics itself arose because physicists paid attention to anomalies,” Loeb stated during a Q&A session.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Loeb has long advocated for the serious examination of Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs). He argues that dismissing such anomalies could hinder opportunities for expanding human knowledge. Previous interstellar visitors, like Oumuamua, have also sparked debate regarding their origins.</p>

<p>While some scientists, including Jason Wright, have criticized Loeb's claims, others, like physicist Sabine Hossenfelder, caution against ignoring the possibility of alien technology due to reputational concerns.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches, scientists plan to conduct coordinated observations to gather more data. Loeb has called for the establishment of an international body to assess interstellar objects and their potential implications for humanity.</p>
