      <h2>Is the Nucleus of 3I/ATLAS 15 Kilometers in Diameter?</h2>

<p>New data from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) has revealed that the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS may have a nucleus diameter of approximately 15 kilometers. This finding comes as scientists continue to study the object, which was first identified on May 15, 2025, when it was 6.1 times further from the Sun than Earth.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant because it suggests that 3I/ATLAS is much larger than the previous interstellar object, 2I/Borisov, which had a nucleus diameter estimated at only 0.8 kilometers. The size of 3I/ATLAS could provide insights into the mass and composition of interstellar objects and their origins. Researchers are now focusing on gathering more data to confirm these findings.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
  <li>Initial identification: May 15, 2025</li>
  <li>Distance from Sun at identification: 6.1 AU</li>
  <li>Diameter estimate of nucleus: approximately 15 kilometers</li>
  <li>Previous interstellar object for comparison: 2I/Borisov (0.8 kilometers)</li>
  <li>Upcoming observation: October 3, 2025, at a distance of 29 million kilometers from Mars</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On May 15, 2025, the ZTF first identified 3I/ATLAS. Initial data indicated a steady brightening of the object starting in early June 2025. A Hubble Space Telescope image taken on July 21, 2025, showed a glow around 3I/ATLAS, suggesting mass loss due to evaporation of ice fragments.</p>
<p>By October 3, 2025, the object will pass 29 million kilometers from Mars, where it will be observed by the HiRISE camera onboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. This observation is expected to provide a clearer picture of the object's size and brightness.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
  “The simplest interpretation of this early plateau is that it represents the bare nucleus, before substantial mass loss was initiated,” said Avi Loeb, co-author of the study.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the second interstellar object detected, following 1I/`Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. The significant difference in size raises questions about the population of interstellar objects and the processes that create them. The rarity of large interstellar objects like 3I/ATLAS suggests that they may only appear once every several millennia.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze data from the upcoming observations of 3I/ATLAS to confirm its size and understand its origins better. The results from the HiRISE camera will be crucial in providing a more accurate assessment of the nucleus's diameter.</p>
