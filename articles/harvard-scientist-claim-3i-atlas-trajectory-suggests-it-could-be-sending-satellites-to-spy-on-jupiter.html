      <h2>Harvard scientist claims 3I/ATLAS trajectory suggests it could be sending 'satellites' to spy on Jupiter</h2>

<p>Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist, has claimed that the trajectory of comet 3I/ATLAS could indicate the object is capable of deploying devices as it approaches Jupiter on March 16, 2024. This assertion has sparked renewed interest and speculation within the scientific community regarding the object’s potential purpose.</p>

<p>The significance of Loeb's claims lies in the challenge they pose to conventional views of interstellar objects. Most astronomers have regarded such objects as natural phenomena rather than manufactured entities. NASA has previously dismissed similar theories, reiterating that 3I/ATLAS is classified as a comet and cautioning against over-interpretation of its path.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will pass within <strong>53.445 million kilometres</strong> of Jupiter on <strong>March 16, 2024</strong>.</li>
    <li>The object will approach Earth on <strong>December 19, 2023</strong>, at a distance of <strong>269 million kilometres</strong>.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb has suggested that the object could deploy small devices into orbit around Jupiter.</li>
    <li>NASA scientists emphasize that 3I/ATLAS is a natural object and warn against speculative interpretations.</li>
    <li>ESA’s Juice spacecraft is currently <strong>64 million kilometres</strong> away from 3I/ATLAS and unable to observe its jets.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On December 19, 2023, 3I/ATLAS will approach Earth at a minimal distance of 269 million kilometres. Following this, the comet will pass close to Jupiter on March 16, 2024, at a distance of 53.445 million kilometres.</p>
<p>During this period, Loeb has raised questions about the possibility of the comet deploying "satellites" as it travels through Jupiter’s Hill Radius, where the planet's gravitational influence is strongest.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “This multi-jet structure constitutes a remarkable target for future observations,” said Loeb, emphasizing the significance of the object’s trajectory.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “It is therefore unlikely that particle probes on Earth-based satellites will be able to capture particles from these jets,” Loeb added, underscoring the challenges of observing the object.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is not the first time interstellar objects have prompted speculation regarding their origins and purpose. Previous discussions have often centered around the nature of such celestial bodies, with many scientists advocating for a cautious approach to interpretation. NASA has consistently classified similar objects as natural phenomena, resisting theories suggesting intelligent design.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches both Earth and Jupiter, scientists will continue to monitor its trajectory and behavior. Investigations into the object’s characteristics and potential implications for future research will likely remain a focus of interest in the astronomical community.</p>
