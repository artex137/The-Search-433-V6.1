      <h2>Alien Abduction and the Church</h2>

<p>A Christian symposium focusing on alien abduction and UFOs has taken place in Roswell, New Mexico, during the annual Roswell UFO Festival in July 2009. The event featured 11 evangelical Christians, including pastors, scholars, and authors, who presented a series of lectures and discussions on the topic of alien encounters from a biblical perspective.</p>

<p>The symposium is significant as it highlights the intersection of faith and the phenomenon of alien abductions. It has drawn attention to the experiences of individuals who believe they have been abducted by extraterrestrial beings. Organizers have indicated that the event has become a crucial space for dialogue and support for those who feel isolated in their experiences.</p>

<h2>Timeline</h2>

<p>During the symposium, participants explored various topics related to UFOs and alien abduction, including biblical interpretations and personal experiences. The event aimed to provide a supportive environment for individuals who have encountered these phenomena.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>

    “Pastor, HELP! I’m being abducted by aliens!” This was a common plea, according to Pastor Chris Ward, who noted that many individuals sought prayer and deliverance for their experiences.

    “It’s not outside the ministry of Jesus,” said Ruzz Dizdar, a pastor and deliverance minister, emphasizing the need for spiritual support for those claiming abduction experiences.

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The symposium in Roswell is part of a broader trend where religious leaders engage with modern phenomena such as UFOs and alien abductions. Previous studies, including those conducted by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the 1990s, have shown that a significant portion of the population believes they have experienced alien abduction. Reports suggest that around 2-3% of the U.S. population may identify with these experiences.</p>
<p>Pastor Chris Ward and other participants have noted that many people feel stigmatized or dismissed when they share their encounters, leading to a need for compassionate dialogue within faith communities.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Future discussions and events are anticipated to continue exploring the relationship between faith and experiences of alien abduction. Organizers plan to hold more symposiums, fostering dialogue and support for individuals seeking understanding and spiritual guidance regarding their experiences.</p>
