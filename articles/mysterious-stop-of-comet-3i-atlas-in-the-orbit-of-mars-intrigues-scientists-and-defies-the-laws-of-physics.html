      <h2>Mysterious stop of comet 3I/Atlas in the orbit of Mars intrigues scientists and defies the laws of physics</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/Atlas has performed an unprecedented maneuver by completely stopping its movement for several days as it approached the orbit of Mars in October 2025. This event occurred approximately 27 million kilometers from the red planet and has mobilized the global scientific community to explore the implications of this anomaly.</p>

<p>This phenomenon challenges existing theories of celestial mechanics and has prompted scientists to investigate the comet's unique interaction with cosmic forces. The North American space agency NASA has confirmed the validity of the observations, ruling out any equipment malfunction. Researchers are now analyzing data from telescopes and probes orbiting Mars to understand the mechanisms behind this unusual behavior.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas stopped moving for several days while approaching Mars.</li>
    <li>The event occurred in October 2025, at a distance of approximately 27 million kilometers from Mars.</li>
    <li>The comet follows a hyperbolic trajectory, characteristic of objects that visit the solar system only once.</li>
    <li>NASA confirmed that the data collected was valid and not due to instrument errors.</li>
    <li>The comet's nucleus has an estimated diameter between 320 meters and 5.6 kilometers.</li>
    <li>3I/Atlas is approximately 10 billion years old, making it older than the Sun.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In October 2025, multiple NASA instruments recorded the comet's unexpected stop as it approached Mars. This event marked the first time a hyperbolic comet has exhibited such behavior, raising questions about the forces acting on it. Following the observations, NASA confirmed the accuracy of the data, leading to a global scientific inquiry into the phenomenon.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The immobility of comet 3I/Atlas represents an anomaly that shakes the foundations of our understanding of orbital models,” said a NASA spokesperson. “This event forces a fundamental review of how we understand the dynamics of celestial bodies, especially those that come from outside our own star system.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to this event, celestial bodies on hyperbolic trajectories were thought to be unable to stop under normal gravitational influences. The behavior of 3I/Atlas suggests a need to reconsider the complexities of interplanetary dynamics and the potential influences of non-gravitational forces.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to analyze data from the comet to uncover the reasons behind its unusual behavior. Future studies may also lead to updates in orbital simulation software used for predicting the trajectories of space objects, enhancing the accuracy of planetary defense systems.</p>
