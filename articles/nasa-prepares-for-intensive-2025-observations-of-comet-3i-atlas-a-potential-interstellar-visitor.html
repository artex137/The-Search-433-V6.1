      <h2>NASA prepares for intensive 2025 observations of Comet 3I Atlas, a potential interstellar visitor</h2>

<p>NASA has announced plans for an extensive observation campaign of Comet 3I Atlas, which will take place in late 2025. This comet, identified by the ATLAS (Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System) survey, is believed to originate from outside the solar system, prompting significant interest from scientists and astronomers worldwide.</p>

<p>The comet's close approach presents a rare opportunity to study an interstellar object in detail. NASA is coordinating with various observatories and international partners to ensure comprehensive data collection and analysis. Researchers aim to gain insights into the comet's origins and composition, which may enhance understanding of cosmic migration and planetary system diversity.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I Atlas was identified in late 2024.</li>
    <li>It has been classified as an interstellar object.</li>
    <li>NASA will utilize the James Webb Space Telescope and Hubble Space Telescope for observations.</li>
    <li>Observations are scheduled to maximize data collection in late 2025.</li>
    <li>International collaboration is underway to enhance observation efforts.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I Atlas was initially detected in late 2024 through automated sky surveys. Early orbital calculations confirmed its hyperbolic trajectory, indicating it is not bound to the solar system. This classification led to immediate planning for observational strategies, as the comet's transient nature requires rapid response from the scientific community.</p>

<p>NASA has outlined a plan to employ a network of telescopes, including both ground-based and space-based instruments, to track the comet's path. This strategy aims to provide continuous monitoring and adapt to new data as it becomes available.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The study of 3I Atlas offers a unique opportunity to test theories about the formation of interstellar objects,” said a NASA spokesperson. “Our coordinated efforts with international partners will ensure we maximize the scientific return from this extraordinary visitor.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I Atlas follows the identification of previous interstellar objects, such as 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. These occurrences have heightened interest in studying objects from outside our solar system, as they provide direct samples of material from different stellar environments.</p>

<p>Understanding the chemical diversity and formation conditions of these interstellar objects is essential for refining models of planet formation and the evolution of planetary systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Nasa will continue to refine observational models for Comet 3I Atlas as it approaches Earth. The agency plans to assess its trajectory and optimize observation schedules to ensure detailed studies of this unique comet.</p>
