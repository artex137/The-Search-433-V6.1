      <h2>You might soon be able to study UFOs at college</h2>

<p>A group of researchers has proposed the establishment of a new academic discipline dedicated to the study of unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs), commonly known as UFOs. This movement, led by the Society for UAP Studies, culminated in an international conference that began on December 4, 2025.</p>

<p>The initiative aims to bring serious academic scrutiny to UAPs, which have often been dismissed or ridiculed. Michael Cifone, co-founder and president of the Society for UAP Studies, emphasized the need for an empirical approach to understanding these phenomena. The society seeks collaboration across various academic fields to create a framework for rigorous study.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Conference began on December 4, 2025.</li>
    <li>Society for UAP Studies is co-founded by Michael Cifone and Michael Silberstein.</li>
    <li>Cifone holds a Ph.D. in the philosophy of science from the University of Maryland, College Park.</li>
    <li>Society includes academics from diverse disciplines, including philosophy, law, and the sciences.</li>
    <li>Funding is sourced from private and philanthropic donations; no government backing disclosed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 2004, U.S. Navy pilots reported seeing anomalous aerial vehicles while aboard the U.S.S. Nimitz and U.S.S. Princeton. In 2024, Congress held hearings regarding UAPs, and the Pentagon acknowledged the existence of "definitely anomalies." Further hearings were conducted in early 2025 based on numerous UAP reports. The All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office indicated a geographic collection bias in the data related to UAP sightings.</p>

<p>On December 4, 2025, the Society for UAP Studies held its second international conference to discuss the establishment of a formal academic discipline for UAP research.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “We’re not necessarily taking a position on whether UAPs are evidence of extraterrestrial life, or what their existence could mean for humanity's understanding of its place in the universe,” said Cifone.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “We like to emphasize positional neutrality, the methodology and standards of evidence that would be a part of any other academic pursuit,” Cifone added.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “We should prepare for and be open to the possibility” of intelligent life, stated keynote speaker Steve Fuller during the conference.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The study of UAPs has traditionally been met with skepticism in academic circles. However, recent interest has surged following military reports and congressional hearings that have acknowledged the existence of unexplained phenomena. The Society for UAP Studies seeks to legitimize this area of inquiry by applying academic rigor and establishing a framework for research.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The Society for UAP Studies plans to continue its efforts to secure institutional backing and resources to develop this new academic discipline. Researchers will pursue collaborative studies to enhance understanding of UAPs while maintaining a focus on scientific objectivity.</p>
