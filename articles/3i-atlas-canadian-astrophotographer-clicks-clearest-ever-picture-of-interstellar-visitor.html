      <h2>3I/ATLAS: Canadian Astrophotographer Clicks Clearest-Ever Picture Of Interstellar Visitor</h2>

<p>On November 24, 2025, Canadian astrophotographer <strong>Paul Craggs</strong> captured what many are calling the clearest images of the interstellar comet <strong>3I/ATLAS</strong> using a portable smart telescope from his location, although specific details about the location have not been disclosed. This follows a live webcast by NASA on November 19, 2025, where the agency shared a series of images that disappointed many stargazers due to their unclear quality.</p>

<p>The images from Craggs, taken with a telescope valued at approximately Rs 44,000, have sparked discussions among amateur and professional astronomers alike. While NASA's images were criticized for their fuzziness, Craggs' photos have generated excitement within the astrophotography community. NASA has since addressed the criticisms regarding the quality of their images and has continued to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date:</strong> November 19, 2025 (NASA webcast), November 24, 2025 (Craggs' images)</li>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> Not disclosed</li>
    <li><strong>Photographer:</strong> Paul Craggs</li>
    <li><strong>Telescope:</strong> Dwarf 3, valued at Rs 44,000</li>
    <li><strong>NASA's Image Release:</strong> Featured fuzzy images of 3I/ATLAS</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 19, 2025, NASA conducted a live webcast to present images of 3I/ATLAS. The images released by the agency were criticized for their low quality. In the days following, amateur astronomers, including Craggs, began sharing clearer images of the comet. Craggs published his images on November 24, 2025, showcasing what he claims is a clearer view of the comet's features.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It is apparent that 3I/ATLAS is an extremely rare and mysterious object, especially if it happens to be a natural comet,” said Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist, during a recent interview.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS, an interstellar comet, has drawn significant attention since its discovery. The object has been the subject of various analyses and discussions, particularly regarding its composition and behavior. Avi Loeb has identified several anomalies in 3I/ATLAS, suggesting it may not simply be a comet.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA continues to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth. Ongoing observations will likely focus on gathering more data to better understand the object and its potential implications for future studies of interstellar bodies.</p>
