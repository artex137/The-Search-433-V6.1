      <h2>Documentary "Age of Disclosure" Exposes 80 Years of Government Cover-Up of UAP</h2>

<p>The documentary "The Age of Disclosure," directed by Dan Farah, has unveiled allegations of an 80-year government cover-up regarding unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) in the United States. The film features interviews with 34 senior U.S. officials and highlights the ongoing need for transparency in addressing these phenomena. It premiered in select theaters in New York, Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles, and is available for worldwide purchase or rental on Amazon Prime Video.</p>

<p>This documentary matters as it seeks to inform the public about UAP and the government's alleged concealment of information. According to Farah, senior members of Congress and the administration are now pursuing the truth, partly due to insights from whistleblowers. The film argues that the U.S. is engaged in a "high-stakes, secret Cold War" with nations like China and Russia over the investigation of non-human intelligence.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Documentary title: "The Age of Disclosure."</li>
    <li>Directed by: Dan Farah.</li>
    <li>Number of interviewed officials: 34.</li>
    <li>Notable interviewee: Secretary of State Marco Rubio.</li>
    <li>Release locations: New York, Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Over the past three years, the film has collected testimonies from high-ranking officials regarding UAP. The documentary has surfaced amid heightened public interest and congressional discussions about UAP disclosure, following years of classified information.</p>

<p>Farah stated that the film reveals a significant shift in how the government addresses UAP, with more officials willing to speak out about their experiences and knowledge.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“For a very long time, the public, Congress and even the president have been kept out of the loop on this subject,” said director Dan Farah in an interview. “Now we have leaders in Congress and in the administration that are trying to get to the bottom of it.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“We've had repeated instances of something operating in the airspace over restricted nuclear facilities, and it's not ours,” said Secretary Rubio in the film's trailer.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The topic of UAP has often been shrouded in secrecy, leading to widespread speculation and conspiracy theories. The documentary aims to hold the government accountable for its lack of transparency regarding UAP discoveries and the existence of non-human intelligence.</p>

<p>Farah emphasized that the film represents a growing movement among military and intelligence officials to disclose information about UAP and the implications for national security.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Following the release of "The Age of Disclosure," discussions in Congress regarding UAP transparency are expected to continue. Investigations into the government's handling of UAP information may also intensify as public interest grows.</p>
