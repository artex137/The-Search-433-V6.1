      <h2>Scientists Say 3I/ATLAS Could Be Older Than the Sun — And Its Star May Be Gone</h2>

<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, detected on 1 July 2025 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert system (ATLAS) survey telescope at the Observatory of Las Armas in Chile, has captured the attention of astronomers due to its unique characteristics. Research indicates that 3I/ATLAS may have formed in the Milky Way's thick disk, potentially making it older than the Solar System, which is estimated to be 4.6 billion years old.</p>

<p>This discovery challenges conventional theories of comet formation and provides insights into the early universe. Astronomers at the University of Oxford have placed the age of 3I/ATLAS between 8 and 14 billion years, suggesting it could be the oldest comet-like object ever discovered. The findings highlight the importance of studying such objects to understand the evolution of planetary systems.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date of detection:</strong> 1 July 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Location of detection:</strong> Observatory of Las Armas, Chile</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Approximately 58 km/s (130,000 mph)</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to the Sun:</strong> 30 October 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to Earth:</strong> 19 December 2025, at approximately 1.8 astronomical units</li>
    <li><strong>Age range (University of Oxford study):</strong> 8 to 14 billion years</li>
    <li><strong>Age range (University of Michigan analysis):</strong> 3 to 11 billion years</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was detected on 1 July 2025, marking the beginning of its study as an interstellar object. The object made its closest approach to the Sun on or about 30 October 2025, followed by its closest approach to Earth on 19 December 2025. Observations during these events provided valuable data for astronomers.</p>

<p>Research has indicated that 3I/ATLAS may have originated from the Milky Way's thick disk, suggesting a formation period that predates the Solar System. Its hyperbolic orbit and high velocity further support its interstellar origin.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS is billions of years older than the Sun and planets, and thus likely the oldest comet-like object ever discovered,” said a researcher from the University of Oxford.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Speculating about exotic possibilities may capture the headlines; however, existing scientific evidence remains consistent with known cometary physics,” a representative from the astrophysics community stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The study of interstellar objects like 3I/ATLAS is relatively new, with previous incidents such as the detection of 'Oumuamua in 2017 sparking interest in the field. These objects provide a glimpse into the conditions of the early universe and the formation of stars and planetary systems.</p>

<p>As research continues, scientists aim to gather more data on 3I/ATLAS to better understand its composition and history, which may inform theories about the evolution of the universe.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS moves out into the Galaxy, it will become less visible. However, the data collected during its flyby will be invaluable for ongoing research into interstellar objects and their implications for planetary system development.</p>
