      <h2>ETAMU and the Mystery Above: A History of UFOs on Campus and Beyond</h2>

<p>East Texas A&M University (ETAMU) has explored the topic of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) for decades, with student curiosity peaking as recently as 2025. The university's engagement with UFO phenomena spans from early student theories in the 1950s to contemporary educational courses that examine the possibility of extraterrestrial life. No injuries or fatalities have been reported related to UFO sightings at the university.</p>

<p>This ongoing interest in UFOs is significant as it reflects broader societal questions about life beyond Earth. ETAMU has hosted experts, conducted research, and included UFO studies in its curriculum, fostering a unique environment for inquiry and speculation about the unknown.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>First mention of UFOs in ETAMU's student newspaper: March 31, 1950</li>
    <li>Number of UFO report entries for Texas: 6,583 (according to the National UFO Reporting Center)</li>
    <li>Most recent reported UFO sighting in Commerce, Texas: 2013</li>
    <li>Notable experts who have lectured at ETAMU: Stanton Friedman (1972), Dr. J. Allen Hynek (1973), Robert Hastings (1990, 2005)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In March 1950, ETAMU's student newspaper, The East Texan, published an article titled “Students Offer Explanations for Flying Saucers,” where students shared their theories about UFOs.</p>
<p>In April 1950, The East Texan followed up with “Saucer Theories Include ‘The Impossible,’” which presented various speculative explanations for UFO sightings.</p>
<p>Throughout the 1970s, ETAMU hosted several prominent figures in ufology, including Stanton Friedman and Dr. J. Allen Hynek, who contributed to the academic discourse surrounding UFOs.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We start by studying the scientific and philosophical background of life existing elsewhere,” said Assistant Professor Billy Quarles about the Astronomy 120 course. “We study how our views of the universe have changed over time.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>UFO sightings have been reported in Texas for many years. The Aurora UFO Incident in 1897 is among the most notable early cases. ETAMU's involvement in UFO discussions illustrates a long-standing tradition of curiosity and academic inquiry into unexplained phenomena.</p>
<p>In addition to student discourse, ETAMU has integrated UFO studies into its educational framework, offering courses that explore the scientific possibilities of life beyond Earth, reflecting a commitment to both inquiry and education.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>ETAMU plans to continue its exploration of UFOs through academic courses and events, encouraging further investigation into the phenomenon and fostering a culture of curiosity among students and the community.</p>
