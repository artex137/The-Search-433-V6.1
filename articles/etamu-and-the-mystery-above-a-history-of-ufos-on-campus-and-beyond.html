      <h2>ETAMU and the Mystery Above: A History of UFOs on Campus and Beyond</h2>

<p>East Texas A&M University (ETAMU) has explored the topic of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) for decades, with a history that includes student discussions, scientific courses, and notable guest speakers. This tradition continues as part of ETAMU's annual October Spooky Stories Series.</p>

<p>The university's long-standing fascination with UFOs highlights significant cultural and scientific inquiries. ETAMU has hosted experts, offered relevant courses, and provided a platform for both serious study and playful speculation about extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>First article on UFOs published in The East Texan on March 31, 1950.</li>
  <li>Notable guest speakers have included Stanton Friedman (1972), Dr. J. Allen Hynek (1973), and Robert Hastings (1990, 2005).</li>
  <li>Texas has recorded 6,583 UFO reports according to the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC).</li>
  <li>Four UFO reports have originated from Commerce, Texas, with the latest in 2013.</li>
  <li>Notable Texas UFO incidents include the Aurora UFO Incident (1897) and the Lubbock Lights (1951).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In March 1950, The East Texan published an article titled "Students Offer Explanations for Flying Saucers," featuring various theories from students about UFOs, including government experiments and extraterrestrial visitors.</p>
<p>In April 1950, another article, "Saucer Theories Include ‘The Impossible,’" presented wild explanations for UFO sightings, including Hollywood influences and “Texas mosquitos fitted with neon lights.”</p>
<p>Throughout the decades, ETAMU has incorporated UFO studies into its curriculum, including a 1972 sociology class experiment and a chemistry course in 1972 that examined the probability of intelligent life beyond Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We start by studying the scientific and philosophical background of life existing elsewhere,” said Assistant Professor Billy Quarles about the Astronomy 120 course.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>ETAMU's engagement with UFO studies reflects broader societal interests in extraterrestrial life. The university's historical connections to prominent figures in ufology, such as Dr. J. Allen Hynek, underscore its role in serious scientific discourse about UFO phenomena.</p>
<p>Texas has a rich history of UFO sightings, with major incidents like the Lubbock Lights and the Cash-Landrum Incident contributing to the state's reputation as a hotspot for such occurrences.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>ETAMU will continue to offer courses and discussions on UFOs as part of its educational mission, inviting further exploration into the mysteries of the universe.</p>
