      <h2>NASA's Hubble telescope gets another look at 3I/ATLAS. Here's what it found</h2>

<p>NASA's Hubble Space Telescope has captured new images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth in December 2025. The comet, which is not visible to the naked eye, poses no threat to our planet, according to NASA officials.</p>

<p>The observations are significant as they help scientists understand the origins and characteristics of 3I/ATLAS, which is the third known object discovered from outside Earth's solar system. The latest findings from Hubble and a European Space Agency (ESA) orbiter, the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE), provide valuable data about the comet's activity and composition.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will pass within about <strong>170 million miles</strong> of Earth on <strong>December 19, 2025</strong>.</li>
    <li>The comet was first spotted in July 2025, traveling at approximately <strong>220,000 kilometers per hour</strong>.</li>
    <li>Hubble's latest observation occurred on <strong>November 30, 2025</strong>, when 3I/ATLAS was about <strong>178 million miles</strong> from Earth.</li>
    <li>JUICE's closest approach to the comet was on <strong>November 4, 2025</strong>, at a distance of about <strong>41 million miles</strong>.</li>
    <li>The comet's nucleus is estimated to be between <strong>1,400 feet and 3.5 miles</strong> wide.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is expected to remain observable through small telescopes until <strong>spring 2026</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first discovered in July 2025, marking its entry into the solar system after traveling from the direction of the constellation Sagittarius. Observations confirmed that it is on a hyperbolic trajectory that will eventually eject it back into interstellar space.</p>

<p>On October 30, 2025, the comet made its closest approach to the sun, entering a "very active state." JUICE observed the comet from November 2 to November 25, capturing images that revealed signs of activity, including a glowing halo of gas and two distinct tails.</p>

<p>Hubble's latest image was taken on November 30, 2025, as it tracked the comet moving across the sky.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“No aliens. No threat to life here on Earth,” said NASA Acting Administrator Sean Duffy in response to conspiracy theories about the comet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“We certainly haven't seen any technosignatures or anything from it that would lead us to believe it was anything other than a comet,” stated Nicola Fox, associate administrator of NASA's Science Mission Directorate.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable as it is only the third object confirmed to originate from outside the solar system. Its discovery has sparked interest and speculation, including conspiracy theories about its nature. NASA officials have consistently clarified that there is no evidence to support claims that it is anything other than a natural celestial object.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and ESA will continue to analyze data from Hubble and JUICE. Observations from JUICE are expected to be received in February 2026, offering further insights into 3I/ATLAS as it continues its journey through the solar system.</p>
