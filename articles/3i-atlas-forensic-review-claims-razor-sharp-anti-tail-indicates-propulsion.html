      <h2>3I/ATLAS: Forensic Review Claims Razor-Sharp Anti-Tail Indicates 'Propulsion'</h2>

<p>Austrian astrophotographer Michael Jäger has unveiled a new image of comet 3I/ATLAS on November 28, 2025, raising significant questions about the object's behavior as it travels through our Solar System. Discovered by the ATLAS survey in July 2025, 3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object observed, following 'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Astronomers have noted its high velocity of approximately 210,000 km/h, placing it on a hyperbolic trajectory that is not gravitationally bound to the Sun.</p>

<p>This latest image has drawn intense scrutiny from scientists and investigators around the world, as it showcases a razor-sharp anti-tail that seems to defy established cometary physics. Researchers are analyzing the image using rigorous evidentiary techniques similar to those used in legal cases, which may lead to a better understanding of this interstellar traveler.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Discovered: July 2025 by the ATLAS survey</li>
  <li>Image released: November 28, 2025</li>
  <li>Velocity: Approximately 210,000 km/h</li>
  <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2025</li>
  <li>Previous perihelion: October 30, 2025</li>
  <li>Significant observations: Anti-tail and coma structure analyzed</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first discovered in July 2025 by astronomers using the ATLAS survey. Following its discovery, it exhibited an unusually high velocity, which confirmed its interstellar origin. On October 30, 2025, the comet reached its perihelion, leading to notable changes in brightness and rotation indicators. Jäger released his striking image of the comet on November 28, 2025, prompting renewed interest and investigation into its peculiar characteristics.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We have subjected this visual data to the same stringent evidentiary techniques used in legal cases: isolating structures, assessing directional vectors, and cross-referencing features against established scientific baselines,” said Jäger.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“This object is 'not behaving like a natural comet,'” he added, emphasizing the need for further investigation.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior interstellar objects, such as 'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have also prompted extensive scientific inquiry. However, the behaviors exhibited by 3I/ATLAS, particularly its razor-sharp anti-tail, diverge significantly from typical cometary behavior. This anomaly has led to debates among scientists regarding the nature of such interstellar objects and their interactions with the solar environment.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth on December 19, 2025, scientists will continue to monitor its behavior closely. Researchers aim to determine whether the peculiar features, including the anti-tail and rotational signatures, persist or evolve as the comet draws nearer. This observation period is critical for advancing our understanding of the comet and its origins.</p>
