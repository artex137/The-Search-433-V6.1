      <h2>Indian scientists observe 3I/ATLAS: Behaving like a 'typical' solar system comet</h2>

<p>Indian scientists have observed the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS for the first time from Mount Abu between November 12 and November 15, 2025. They reported seeing a bright coma and noted that the comet is behaving similarly to other comets in the solar system. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as it adds to the understanding of 3I/ATLAS, which is currently leaving the inner solar system. The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) disclosed details of the observation on its official website, highlighting the use of advanced imaging and spectroscopic techniques.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Observation dates: November 12-15, 2025</li>
    <li>Location: Mount Abu, India</li>
    <li>Observing agency: Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)</li>
    <li>Telescope used: 1.2 metre telescope at an altitude of 1680 m</li>
    <li>Data consistent with typical solar system comets</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 12, 2025, scientists from the Physical Research Laboratory (PRL) began observing 3I/ATLAS using a 1.2 metre telescope. The observations included imaging and spectroscopic analysis. By November 15, they had captured significant details about the comet's coma and gas production rate, which suggested it falls within the category of typical solar system comets.</p>

<p>In a related development, NASA released its observations of 3I/ATLAS on November 19, 2025, after a government shutdown delayed the information. Various NASA missions, including the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, had previously captured images of the comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The production rate ratios seem to place this comet in the class of ‘typical comets’ of the solar system,” ISRO stated regarding their findings.</blockquote>

<blockquote>ISRO added, “Further observations will be continued as the comet gradually comes into the darker part of the night.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is the first time that Indian scientists have observed 3I/ATLAS, which has been tracked by multiple international space agencies. Earlier observations of the comet by NASA included data from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and the MAVEN orbiter, among others, highlighting the collaborative nature of current astronomical research.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to continue their observations of 3I/ATLAS as it moves further from the Sun, aiming to gather more data on its characteristics and behavior.</p>
