      <h2>NASA and ESA Release Stunning Images of Comet 3I ATLAS and Other Celestial Phenomena</h2>

<p>The joint United States and European Space agencies (NASA and ESA) have unveiled a collection of striking images, including those of comet 3I/ATLAS, which was observed on 30 November at approximately 286 million kilometres from Earth. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this observation.</p>

<p>This release highlights the beauty of the solar system and the wider universe, while also addressing the impact of global warming on Earth. Authorities from NASA and ESA continue to study these celestial objects to gain insights into their characteristics and implications for science and climate understanding.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS observed on 30 November</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth: approximately 286 million kilometres</li>
    <li>Hubble image features spiral galaxy NGC 1792, located 50 million light-years away</li>
    <li>ESA's James Webb telescope captured a pair of dwarf galaxies about 24 million light-years away</li>
    <li>Copernicus Sentinel-2 images show flooding in Indonesia, impacting over 900 lives</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 30 November, NASA and ESA observed comet 3I/ATLAS from a distance of approximately 286 million kilometres. The satellite tracked the comet, producing images that displayed streaks of blue lines, which are background stars.</p>

<p>In addition to the comet images, Hubble provided a picture of the spiral galaxy NGC 1792, known for its active star formation. This area has been the focus of research and imaging since 2020. The ESA's James Webb telescope captured images of two dwarf galaxies engaged in a gravitational dance.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellite documented the aftermath of recent flooding in Indonesia, which has claimed over 900 lives.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This image provides further data collected throughout 2025, offering a more comprehensive insight into this fascinating area of space,” said an ESA representative regarding the Hubble image of NGC 1792.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The gravitational dance of the dwarf galaxies illustrates the dynamic interactions occurring in our universe,” an ESA spokesperson commented on the James Webb telescope's findings.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This release follows a series of significant observations by NASA and ESA, showcasing the continuous exploration of our solar system and beyond. The impact of global warming has been a growing concern, and the recent flooding in Indonesia emphasizes the urgency of addressing climate change.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and ESA will continue to monitor and analyze these celestial phenomena, while also focusing on the implications of climate change as observed through satellite imagery.</p>
