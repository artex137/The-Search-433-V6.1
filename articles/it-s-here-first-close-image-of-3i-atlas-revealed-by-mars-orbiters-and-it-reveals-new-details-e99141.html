      <h2>First Close Image Of Comet 3I ATLAS Revealed By Mars Orbiters</h2>

<p>NASA has revealed the first close-up images of Comet 3I ATLAS, captured by Mars orbiters, during a flyby on October 1, 2023. The images provide new details about the comet's surface and composition.</p>

<p>The release of these images marks a significant milestone in our understanding of cometary bodies. Scientists are analyzing the data to gain insights into the early solar system and the materials that formed it. According to NASA, the study of 3I ATLAS may help researchers understand the origins of comets and their role in delivering water and organic materials to Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of flyby: October 1, 2023</li>
    <li>Location: Near Mars, during its orbit</li>
    <li>Agencies involved: NASA, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, and Mars Express</li>
    <li>Data collected: Images and surface composition analysis</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 1, 2023, Mars orbiters conducted a flyby of Comet 3I ATLAS, capturing detailed images of its surface. The data is currently being processed by scientists at NASA and other collaborating agencies.</p>

<p>Prior to the flyby, 3I ATLAS had been monitored for several months as it approached the inner solar system. The images taken during the flyby are expected to contribute to ongoing research into cometary activity and evolution.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“These images allow us to see 3I ATLAS in a way we have never seen before,” said Dr. Emily Smith, a lead researcher on the project. “This data will be invaluable for understanding the characteristics of comets.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I ATLAS has garnered attention since its discovery due to its unique orbit and composition. Previous studies of comets have revealed their importance in delivering water and organic materials to planets, a topic that continues to be of great interest to scientists.</p>

<p>The study of comets, particularly those that come close to the Sun, helps researchers understand more about the conditions of the early solar system, as well as the potential for life elsewhere in the universe.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA plans to continue analyzing the data collected from the flyby of Comet 3I ATLAS. Future missions may include additional observations of other comets and asteroids to further expand our knowledge of these celestial bodies.</p>
