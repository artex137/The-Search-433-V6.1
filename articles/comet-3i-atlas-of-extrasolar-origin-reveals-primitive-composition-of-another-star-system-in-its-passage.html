      <h2>Comet 3I/Atlas of extrasolar origin reveals primitive composition of another star system in its passage</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/Atlas, an interstellar object, has passed through the Solar System, reaching its closest point to Earth at the end of 2025. This marks the third confirmed interstellar visitor detected, providing scientists with valuable insights into the formation of planets in distant star systems.</p>

<p>The comet's passage has mobilized an extensive global observation campaign. Astronomers have noted its primitive composition, rich in volatile materials and carbon, suggesting it is a remnant from the early stages of an extrasolar planetary system. The nature of 3I/Atlas offers a unique opportunity to study the chemistry and conditions that existed at its place of origin billions of years ago.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: End of 2025</li>
    <li>Speed: Approximately 58 kilometers per second</li>
    <li>Orbit: Passed within Mars' orbit before exiting the Solar System</li>
    <li>Composition: Rich in carbon, water ice, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide</li>
    <li>Notable activity: Intense cryovolcanic eruptions observed</li>
    <li>Collaborating agencies: NASA, European Space Agency (ESA), and various ground-based observatories</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In mid-2025, 3I/Atlas was detected while it was already within the orbit of Jupiter. Astronomers quickly calculated its trajectory and confirmed its interstellar origin, ruling out any collision risk with Earth. The comet reached perihelion, the closest point to the Sun, within Mars' orbit before continuing its journey into deep space.</p>

<p>As it approached the Sun, 3I/Atlas displayed cryovolcanic activity, with jets of gas and dust being expelled from its core. Observations from the Hubble Space Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope provided critical data on its structure and chemical composition.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The passage of 3I/Atlas has offered us a rare glimpse into the building blocks of planetary systems,” said a NASA representative. “Its primitive composition helps us understand the origins of such bodies and their role in the distribution of essential ingredients for life across the galaxy.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas is distinct from previous interstellar visitors like 1I/’Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Its composition is classified as carbonaceous, similar to the oldest materials found in our Solar System. This suggests that planetary building blocks in other systems may be chemically similar to those in our own.</p>

<p>The study of such objects enhances our understanding of how planetary systems form and evolve, reinforcing theories about the distribution of volatile materials across the galaxy.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Observations of 3I/Atlas will continue until it becomes too faint to detect. The data collected will aid astronomers in refining theoretical models regarding the dynamics of protoplanetary disks and the ejection of planetary bodies. The comet's passage has also validated the astronomical community's readiness to respond to transient events, paving the way for future missions like ESA’s Comet Interceptor.</p>
