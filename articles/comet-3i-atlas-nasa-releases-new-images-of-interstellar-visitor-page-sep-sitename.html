      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS: NASA Releases New Images of Interstellar Visitor</h2>

<p>NASA has released new images of comet 3I/ATLAS, the interstellar visitor expected to be visible from Earth soon, following its closest approach to the sun on October 29, 2025. The comet was first discovered by the NASA-funded ATLAS survey telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile, and reported to the Minor Planet Center on July 1, 2025. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in relation to this celestial event.</p>

<p>This release is significant as it may contribute to our understanding of interstellar objects and planetary defense. Emerging evidence suggests that comet 3I/ATLAS behaves like a typical comet, contrary to earlier speculation about its nature. NASA's various missions are collaborating to observe and study this rare comet as it passes through our solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the sun occurred on October 29, 2025.</li>
    <li>It will pass no closer than 170 million miles from Earth next month.</li>
    <li>The comet flew within 19 million miles of Mars in early October.</li>
    <li>NASA's Psyche mission conducted observations on September 8 and 9.</li>
    <li>Images were taken when the comet was approximately 33 million miles from the spacecraft.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first identified by the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile on July 1, 2025. It made its closest approach to the sun on October 29, 2025. Observations taken by NASA's Psyche mission occurred on September 8 and 9, 2025, while the comet was about 33 million miles from the spacecraft. The comet passed within 19 million miles of Mars in early October.</p>

<p>Additional observations were made by the Mars-orbiting MAVEN spacecraft on September 28, providing spectral data to analyze the comet's chemical composition. The ESA/NASA SOHO mission captured images of the comet from October 15 to 16.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The data is helping astronomers refine the trajectory of 3I/ATLAS and learn more about the faint coma surrounding its nucleus,” said Tom Statler, lead scientist for solar system small bodies at NASA.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable as the third interstellar object identified passing through our solar system. NASA's ongoing efforts to track and study such objects are crucial for enhancing our understanding of their origins and behaviors, which can inform planetary defense strategies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to monitor comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches its closest point to Earth. Further observations and analysis will be conducted to gather more data on its composition and trajectory.</p>
