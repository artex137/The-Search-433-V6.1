      <h2>NASA detects fingerprint of water on ancient Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>NASA has confirmed the presence of water's chemical signature on interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, a discovery made by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, which could reshape our understanding of distant planetary systems. This finding was announced on [insert date of announcement], following observations made from the observatory in collaboration with Auburn University in Alabama.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it suggests that planet-forming systems beyond our Solar System may share similar chemical compositions. Authorities are now focusing on analyzing the implications of this finding for models of comet evolution and the potential for life elsewhere in the Galaxy.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first observed on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>It is approximately seven billion years old, making it possibly the oldest comet ever observed.</li>
    <li>The comet is on a hyperbolic trajectory, having entered the Solar System from another star.</li>
    <li>The detection of water's chemical signature was made using space-based instruments that captured ultraviolet emissions.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is losing water at a rate of about 40 kilograms per second.</li>
    <li>The findings have been published in a recent study led by Dr. Zexi Xing.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) first spotted comet 3I/ATLAS. Subsequent observations revealed that the comet is on a hyperbolic path and is approximately seven billion years old. NASA's Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory detected hydroxyl gas emissions from the comet, confirming the presence of water's chemical signature. The findings were announced on [insert date of announcement], providing new insights into the evolution of comets and the potential for life in distant planetary systems.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Every interstellar comet so far has been a surprise,” said Dr. Zexi Xing, lead researcher on the study.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Each interstellar comet we’ve observed has rewritten the rules,” stated Prof. Dennis Bodewits, co-author of the study.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS’s behaviour defies our models,” Bodewits added. “It indicates there are physical and chemical processes at play that we’re only beginning to understand.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I/ATLAS, two other interstellar objects, 1I/‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, were identified. Each of these comets exhibited unique characteristics: ‘Oumuamua was dry, while Borisov was rich in carbon monoxide. The detection of water in 3I/ATLAS adds a new layer of complexity to our understanding of these celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has faded from view but is expected to reappear after mid-November 2025. Astronomers plan to continue tracking its chemical activity as it approaches the Sun, potentially offering further insights into the origins of water and life in the universe.</p>
