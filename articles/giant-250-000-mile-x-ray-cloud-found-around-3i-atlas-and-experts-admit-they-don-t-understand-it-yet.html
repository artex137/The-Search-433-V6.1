      <h2>Giant 250,000-mile X-ray Cloud Found Around 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Scientists have discovered a giant 250,000-mile-wide X-ray cloud surrounding the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, which is currently passing through our solar system. The finding, made by the XRISM space mission, has left experts puzzled as they do not fully understand the phenomenon.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant because it challenges existing knowledge about comets. The X-ray glow is the first of its kind observed around an interstellar object, prompting scientists to conduct further investigations before 3I/ATLAS exits the solar system next year.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>X-ray cloud measures approximately 250,000 miles wide</li>
    <li>Discovered by XRISM, a mission run by Japan's JAXA, NASA, and ESA</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object</li>
    <li>First detection of X-rays from an interstellar visitor</li>
    <li>Scientists believe the glow may be caused by charge exchange reactions</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will leave the solar system in 2024</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified as an interstellar object and has been under observation since its discovery. The XRISM mission detected the X-ray glow around 3I/ATLAS recently, marking a significant moment in the study of interstellar objects.</p>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches the Sun, scientists are gathering data to understand the characteristics of the gas cloud and the source of the X-ray emission.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The X-ray picture covers a space millions of kilometers wide, showing a faint but real glow all around the object,” said Harvard professor Avi Loeb.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third known interstellar object, following 'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Previous studies of comets have primarily focused on visible light, ultraviolet, radio waves, and infrared emissions. The detection of X-rays adds a new dimension to the understanding of these celestial phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists are preparing additional observations to measure the size of the gas cloud, assess the strength of the X-ray glow, and determine its characteristics compared to typical comets. Time is limited as 3I/ATLAS approaches its departure from the solar system.</p>
