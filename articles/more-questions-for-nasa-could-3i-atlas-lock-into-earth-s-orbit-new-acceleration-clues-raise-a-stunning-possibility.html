      <h2>More Questions For NASA: Could 3I/ATLAS Lock Into Earth’s Orbit?</h2>

<p>NASA has entered a critical phase in its observations of comet 3I/ATLAS, which has exhibited unusual acceleration patterns that raise the possibility of it establishing a long-term orbit with Earth. This development comes as NASA prepares to release new images and data during a live event today.</p>

<p>The behavior of 3I/ATLAS has prompted researchers globally to reassess its trajectory. The comet has shown the ability to speed up and slow down in ways that defy conventional comet physics, leading to discussions about its potential to enter a stable orbital relationship with Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS has demonstrated erratic changes in acceleration.</li>
    <li>Earth's new quasi-moon, asteroid 2025 PN7, was confirmed in September 2025.</li>
    <li>Asteroid 2025 PN7 is approximately 19 meters (62 feet) wide.</li>
    <li>2025 PN7 will remain in proximity to Earth until approximately 2083.</li>
    <li>The closest approach of 3I/ATLAS to Earth is scheduled for December 19.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In September 2025, astronomers confirmed the presence of asteroid 2025 PN7 as a quasi-moon of Earth. This small object has been observed to move in a synchronized path with Earth, suggesting a stable, long-term relationship. As scientists study 3I/ATLAS, they focus on its unusual acceleration patterns and what they might mean for its trajectory.</p>

<p>As of now, the comet's closest approach to Earth is set for December 19, 2023. Researchers are closely monitoring its behavior leading up to this date.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The acceleration profile of 3I/ATLAS is rewriting the boundaries of what interstellar objects can do,” said Samuel Lopez from USA Herald.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of asteroid 2025 PN7 has shifted the conversation around interstellar objects and their interactions with Earth. Previously, such phenomena were considered unlikely, but the behavior of 3I/ATLAS challenges existing models of comet behavior and raises new questions about the nature of celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA's live event today will provide further insights into 3I/ATLAS, including new images and analysis. The scientific community will continue to evaluate the comet's trajectory and behavior as the December 19 approach date nears.</p>
