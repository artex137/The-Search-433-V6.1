      <h2>Harvard scientist proposes urgent planetary network to hunt deep space objects after anomalies in 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has proposed a new planetary network called CISON to detect interstellar objects following anomalies observed in the comet 3I/ATLAS on January 22, 2026. The comet, discovered in July 2025 by the ATLAS system in Chile, displayed unique characteristics during its recent alignment with the Earth-Sun axis.</p>

<p>The proposed CISON network aims to transform interstellar astronomy from a reactive to a predictive model. Loeb's proposal comes after the Hubble Space Telescope captured unprecedented data on 3I/ATLAS, revealing a four-jet system and extreme negative polarization properties that challenge existing comet models.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovery:</strong> 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025 by the ATLAS system in Chile.</li>
    <li><strong>Observation Date:</strong> January 22, 2026.</li>
    <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> 3I/ATLAS aligned to 0.69 degrees from the Earth-Sun axis.</li>
    <li><strong>Hubble Observations:</strong> Hubble documented a prominent antitail and three mini-jets with 170-second exposures.</li>
    <li><strong>Polarimetric Properties:</strong> 3I/ATLAS exhibits extreme negative polarization, unlike previous interstellar comets.</li>
    <li><strong>Proposed Network:</strong> CISON includes three phases: discovery, rapid characterization, and selective interception.</li>
    <li><strong>Publication Date:</strong> The proposal was published on arXiv on January 28, 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered by the ATLAS system in Chile. On January 22, 2026, during a unique alignment with the Earth-Sun axis, the Hubble Space Telescope captured significant data about the comet, including its unusual four-jet structure. This observation prompted Avi Loeb to propose the CISON network on January 28, 2026, to enhance detection and study of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Most surveys are cadence-limited, meaning they scan the sky too infrequently to reliably detect fast-moving interstellar objects in their early stages,” said Avi Loeb regarding the limitations of current astronomical surveys.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The anomalies observed in 3I/ATLAS are significant as they may represent a new class of comets, distinct from both solar comets and previous interstellar visitors. The extreme polarimetric behavior of this comet has led researchers to suggest a mixture of large, icy, dark particles in its coma, indicating a potential shift in our understanding of cometary activity.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The CISON network proposal aims to enhance early detection rates of interstellar objects and will require collaboration among observatories in both hemispheres to achieve full sky coverage. Further research and discussions are expected to follow the publication of the proposal.</p>
