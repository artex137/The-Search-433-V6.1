      <h2>3I/ATLAS Challenges Models of Comet Behaviour After Highest Eccentricity Recorded</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has recorded the highest orbital eccentricity ever documented, presenting a challenge to existing models of comet behaviour. This interstellar object is currently travelling through our solar system and was first observed using powerful telescopes, including Pan-STARRS and the European Southern Observatory.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it confirms that 3I/ATLAS originated outside our solar system. Scientists are now studying its unique trajectory to gain insights into the composition and evolution of celestial objects from distant star systems.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS has an orbital eccentricity exceeding 2.5.</li>
    <li>It is the third interstellar object identified, following 'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019.</li>
    <li>The comet's trajectory indicates it is on a one-way trip through the cosmos.</li>
    <li>Initial findings suggest it may contain frozen gas and dust.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is expected to travel too far from Earth for precise observation soon.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Astronomers first spotted 3I/ATLAS using telescopes in late 2023. They quickly noted its excessive velocity and atypical trajectory, confirming its status as an interstellar visitor. Subsequent observations revealed its record-breaking orbital eccentricity, prompting further studies into its composition and behaviour.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS provides researchers with valuable insights into the movement of celestial objects between star systems,” an astronomer stated. “Its unique trajectory allows us to better understand how planetary systems evolve.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous interstellar objects, such as 'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have offered limited insights into the origins of celestial materials. The discovery of 3I/ATLAS, with its extreme orbital characteristics, enhances the scientific community's understanding of the dynamics and formation of objects beyond our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey, researchers will analyse the data collected during its passage. This information will aid in refining future telescopes and space missions aimed at studying similar interstellar objects.</p>
