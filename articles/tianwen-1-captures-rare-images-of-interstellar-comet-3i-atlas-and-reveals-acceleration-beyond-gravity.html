      <h2>Tianwen-1 captures rare images of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS and reveals acceleration beyond gravity</h2>

<p>The Tianwen-1 probe, operated by the China National Space Agency (CNSA), has captured images of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS on October 3, 2025, from a distance of approximately 30 million kilometers while orbiting Mars. The images show the comet's coma and nucleus, which has an estimated diameter of about 5.6 kilometers. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as it enhances the understanding of interstellar objects and the dynamics of comets. The data collected indicates that the comet is experiencing acceleration not solely attributed to gravity, suggesting material ejection, a common phenomenon in active comets. The Tianwen-1 team has adjusted their high-resolution camera to effectively track the comet's rapid movement.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of observation: October 3, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from Tianwen-1 to 3I/ATLAS: approximately 30 million km</li>
    <li>Relative speed of the comet: approximately 86 km/s</li>
    <li>Core diameter of the comet: about 5.6 km</li>
    <li>Acceleration detected: equivalent to 94 km per square day</li>
    <li>Comet's age: estimated between 3 and 11 billion years</li>
    <li>Observation period: October 1 to 4, 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The Tianwen-1 mission has been operational since February 2021. On September 2025, preparations began for the observation of 3I/ATLAS. During this period, simulations were conducted to adjust the instruments for the comet's hyperbolic trajectory. The actual imaging occurred on October 3, 2025, capturing a sequence of photos that generated a 30-second animation of the comet's displacement.</p>

<p>Joint data from the Tianwen-1 probe, along with European probes ExoMars TGO and Mars Express, confirmed the presence of non-gravitational acceleration near the comet's perihelion on October 29, 2025. This acceleration is believed to be caused by gas jets ejecting material from the comet.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "The observation maximized the capabilities of the HiRIC camera and validated techniques for tracking small bodies," said a spokesperson from the CNSA.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile, 3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar visitor, following 'Oumuamua and Borisov. Its hyperbolic orbit confirms it originated outside the Solar System. The comet's unique chemical composition, including gases such as cyanide and dicarbon, challenges existing models of planetary formation.</p>

<p>The collaboration with European missions has improved the modeling of dust ejection and coma dynamics, contributing to a better understanding of the comet's behavior and its interaction with solar forces.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Data processing will continue to refine estimates of non-gravitational forces acting on 3I/ATLAS. The Tianwen-1 mission's success also lays the groundwork for future missions, including Tianwen-2, which aims to study asteroids and comets in the main belt.</p>
