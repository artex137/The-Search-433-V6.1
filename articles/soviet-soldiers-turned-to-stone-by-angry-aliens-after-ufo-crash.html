      <h2>Soviet soldiers 'turned to stone' by angry aliens after UFO crash</h2>

<p>In a reported incident from 1989, dozens of Soviet soldiers in Siberia were allegedly turned to stone after a UFO crash. According to a 1993 report, 23 soldiers were transformed into stone columns following an encounter with extraterrestrial beings, with only two surviving to tell the tale.</p>

<p>This incident has drawn renewed attention as it raises questions about the existence of advanced extraterrestrial technology and the Soviet Union's historical handling of UFO reports. Authorities have not disclosed any current investigations into the claims, but the event has been referenced in a declassified CIA file, adding a layer of intrigue to the story.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Incident occurred in February 1989 over Siberia.</li>
    <li>23 soldiers reportedly turned to stone after a UFO crash.</li>
    <li>Two soldiers survived the incident.</li>
    <li>Details published in a Ukrainian newspaper and mentioned in a CIA file.</li>
    <li>Reports of the event have been dismissed by Soviet officials as Western fabrications.</li>
    <li>The soldiers' remains were said to be transferred to a secret scientific institution near Moscow.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In February 1989, a surface-to-air missile was fired at an unidentified spacecraft over Siberia. Following the missile strike, five beings reportedly emerged from the wreckage and merged into a glowing sphere. This sphere emitted a beam of light, resulting in the transformation of 23 soldiers into stone columns.</p>

<p>Only two soldiers survived the incident, as they were less exposed to the light. The transformed bodies were said to have been moved to a secret facility near Moscow for analysis.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Soviet officials publicly denied reports of UFOs and alien encounters at the time, claiming they were Western fabrications,” according to the CIA file.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident is part of a broader history of UFO sightings and reports in the Soviet Union. During the 1970s and 1980s, Soviet institutions recorded what they termed “Abnormal Atmospheric Phenomena.” One notable sighting occurred on February 13, 1989, when witnesses observed a large aerial object over Nalchik, described as jellyfish-shaped, which remained in the sky for over an hour.</p>

<p>Another well-known case involved a saucer-shaped craft that flew low over a Soviet military unit during training exercises, further contributing to the intrigue surrounding UFO encounters in the region.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As of now, there are no ongoing investigations into the claims surrounding this incident. The declassified CIA documents merely reference the 1993 report without verifying its contents.</p>
