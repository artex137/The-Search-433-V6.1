      <h2>3I/ATLAS: Avi Loeb’s Latest Study Reveals Interstellar Comet Rotates Every 7.1 Hours Since Perihelion</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist Abraham ‘Avi’ Loeb has published a new study on interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, revealing that the comet has maintained a rotation period of 7.1 hours since its perihelion. The study, co-authored with Toni Scarmato from an observatory in Italy, details these findings in a paper titled “Rotation Period of 3I/ATLAS After Perihelion from Jet Position Angle Wobble and Photometric Variability.” The publication date is not disclosed.</p>

<p>This research is significant as it provides insight into the comet's behavior and characteristics in the interstellar medium. According to the study, the periodic wobble of the comet's jet around its rotation axis has remained unchanged during perihelion, suggesting a unique alignment with the Sun that is statistically unlikely to occur by chance.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Study title: “Rotation Period of 3I/ATLAS After Perihelion from Jet Position Angle Wobble and Photometric Variability”</li>
<li>Authors: Avi Loeb and Toni Scarmato</li>
<li>Rotation period of 3I/ATLAS: 7.1 hours</li>
<li>Statistical probability of the comet's alignment with the Sun: 1.5–6%</li>
<li>Observation methods: Harmonic modeling and photometric time series</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Avi Loeb and Toni Scarmato conducted their research using harmonic modeling and photometric data to analyze 3I/ATLAS. They observed that the periodic wobble of the comet's jet has not changed since perihelion. The findings have been documented in their latest paper.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The alignment of the rotation axis of 3I/ATLAS to within 10–20 degrees with the direction of the Sun at large distances is anomalous, as it has only a probability of 1.5–6% for occurring at random in interstellar space,” said Loeb in the study.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This study adds to the growing body of research surrounding 3I/ATLAS, which has been noted for various anomalies since its discovery. Previous studies have explored different aspects of the comet, including its potential origins and behavior in space.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further analyses of 3I/ATLAS may follow as researchers continue to investigate its unique characteristics and implications for our understanding of interstellar objects.</p>
