      <h2>NASA Faces Criticism Over Blurry 3I/ATLAS Images</h2>
<p>NASA has come under scrutiny for the quality of images of comet 3I/ATLAS, with many netizens comparing the agency's visuals unfavorably to those captured by amateur astronomers. The criticism has emerged as NASA conducts its ongoing observation campaign of the comet across the solar system.</p>

<p>This situation highlights public concerns about the clarity of NASA's images and the potential for secrecy regarding the comet's observations. The debate continues as NASA prepares for a special session on November 20, during which it plans to share more information and images of 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object to pass through the solar system.</li>
    <li>Nasa began tracking the comet after its discovery on July 1.</li>
    <li>NASA's closest images of 3I/ATLAS were taken from spacecraft near Mars, which passed the comet at a distance of 19 million miles.</li>
    <li>NASA plans to hold a special 3I/ATLAS session on November 20.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will be closest to Earth on December 19, at a distance of 170 million miles.</li>
    <li>A total of twelve spacecraft have captured and processed images of the comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>NASA's observation campaign of 3I/ATLAS began after its discovery on July 1. The agency has since used multiple spacecraft to monitor the comet's movement and composition. Key dates in the observation timeline include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>September 8-9: NASA's Psyche mission captured images from 33 million miles away.</li>
    <li>September 16: The Lucy mission recorded images from 240 million miles away.</li>
    <li>September 11 - October 2: NASA's STEREO mission took images of 3I/ATLAS while it was behind the Sun.</li>
    <li>October 15 - 26: ESA and NASA’s SOHO mission captured additional images.</li>
    <li>October 3: The PUNCH mission recorded the comet’s tail.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Nasa stated, "All spacecraft are watching 3I/ATLAS as it moves through the solar system." The agency confirmed that more images and explanations will be shared during the upcoming special session.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This criticism of NASA's image quality is not unprecedented. Past incidents have seen the agency facing scrutiny over the clarity and detail of its astronomical images. The current debate reflects ongoing concerns about transparency and public access to high-quality scientific data.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA continues to observe comet 3I/ATLAS and plans to provide further updates during the special session on November 20. The agency will also monitor the comet as it approaches Jupiter’s orbit in spring 2026.</p>
