      <h2>3I/ATLAS Update: Avi Loeb Warns 'We're Screwed' if Advanced Aliens Visit</h2>

<p>The interstellar object known as 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1) has captured the attention of scientists and conspiracy theorists alike since its discovery on 1 July 2025. The object has sparked intense speculation about its nature, with claims of a 'large vessel' associated with it circulating on social media. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in relation to this object.</p>

<p>This situation is significant as it raises questions about the implications of encountering advanced extraterrestrial technology. NASA and the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) have initiated a structured observation campaign to study 3I/ATLAS, marking what could be the first planetary defence exercise focused on an interstellar object. However, NASA has confirmed that 3I/ATLAS poses no immediate threat to Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was discovered on 1 July 2025.</li>
    <li>It will pass closest to the Sun around 29–30 October 2025 at approximately 1.4 astronomical units (AU).</li>
    <li>Its closest approach to Earth will occur on 19 December 2025 at about 1.8 AU, or roughly 270 million kilometres away.</li>
    <li>The object exhibits unusual characteristics, including a coma rich in carbon dioxide and low in water content.</li>
    <li>Nasa has confirmed it poses no immediate threat to Earth.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified by the ATLAS telescope system on 1 July 2025. Since then, it has been observed to have a hyperbolic trajectory, confirming its interstellar classification. Notably, its perihelion is expected on 29–30 October 2025, followed by its closest approach to Earth on 19 December 2025.</p>
<p>In recent months, the object has been the subject of various unverified claims, including alleged footage of a 'large vessel.' While these claims are yet to be substantiated, they have fueled discussions within the scientific community and among the public.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb, head of Harvard's Galileo Project, has stated, "we're screwed" if 3I/ATLAS is revealed to be a technological civilization more advanced than our own.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loeb has also noted that 3I/ATLAS could represent a "black swan event"—a rare, high-impact occurrence that is unpredictable but globally significant.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The interest in 3I/ATLAS follows previous encounters with interstellar objects, such as ‘Oumuamua, which also sparked debate about the potential for extraterrestrial technology. The scientific community remains divided, with some researchers urging caution while others advocate for a more open-minded approach to the data.</p>
<p>NASA's involvement, including the activation of its planetary defence network, highlights the seriousness with which authorities are treating this object as a potential harbinger of unknown phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>In the coming months, astronomers will focus on tracking 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun and re-emerges in December 2025. The IAWN aims to collect precise data on its trajectory, gas emissions, and physical characteristics to clarify its origin and composition. This period will be critical for verifying or debunking the sensational claims surrounding the object.</p>
