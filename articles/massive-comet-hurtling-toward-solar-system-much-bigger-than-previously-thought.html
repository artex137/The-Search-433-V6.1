      <h2>Massive comet hurtling toward solar system, much bigger than previously thought</h2>

<p>A comet named 3I/ATLAS is approaching the inner solar system, where Earth is located, and is much larger than previously estimated, astronomers have said. The comet likely weighs over <strong>33 billion tons</strong>, according to Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb, who made the announcement in a blog post on Thursday.</p>

<p>This discovery matters as it provides insights into the composition and trajectory of interstellar objects. Authorities, including NASA, are monitoring the comet's path as it approaches other planets in the solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS weighs over <strong>33 billion tons</strong>.</li>
    <li>Its diameter is likely more than <strong>5 kilometers</strong>.</li>
    <li>The comet was first detected in July 2023 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Rio Hurtado, Chile.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will come within <strong>1.67 million miles</strong> of Mars' orbit on October 3, 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet is composed mainly of carbon dioxide, with water ice detected in its nucleus.</li>
    <li>It is expected to be visible until it passes too close to the sun after September 2023.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected in July 2023 by ATLAS, an asteroid impact early warning system funded by NASA. On August 6, astronomers used data from the Webb Space Telescope to analyze the comet's trajectory, leading to an updated estimate of its mass and size. Loeb published his findings on September 27, 2023, in a paper that has not yet been peer-reviewed.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "The diameter of the nucleus of the comet is likely more than 3.1 miles, the largest of two other interstellar objects previously recorded."</blockquote>
<blockquote>NASA confirmed that the comet poses no threat to Earth, noting its unusual trajectory will bring it close to Jupiter, Mars, and Venus.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is only the third time in history that an interstellar object entering the inner solar system has been recorded. The first was the cigar-shaped "Oumuamua" in 2017, followed by the comet "21/Borisov" in 2019. These observations have enhanced understanding of celestial bodies outside our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and astronomers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Mars and other planets. The comet is expected to reappear on the other side of the sun in early December 2023.</p>
