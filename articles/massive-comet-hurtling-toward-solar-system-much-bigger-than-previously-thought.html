      <h2>Massive comet hurtling toward solar system, much bigger than previously thought</h2>

<p>A comet named 3I/ATLAS is approaching the inner solar system and is much larger than previously estimated, weighing more than <strong>33 billion tons</strong>, according to Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb. Loeb shared his findings in a blog post on Thursday, following an analysis of the comet's trajectory using data from the Webb Space Telescope.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it marks only the third time an interstellar object has been recorded entering the inner solar system. Authorities, including NASA, have stated that 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth, although its path will bring it near Jupiter, Mars, and Venus.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS weighs over <strong>33 billion tons</strong>.</li>
    <li>Its nuclear diameter is likely more than <strong>5 kilometers</strong>.</li>
    <li>The comet originated from interstellar space and was first detected in July.</li>
    <li>Data was collected by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Rio Hurtado, Chile.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will come within <strong>1.67 million miles</strong> of Mars' orbit on <strong>October 3</strong>.</li>
    <li>The comet is primarily composed of carbon dioxide and water ice.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected in July 2023 by ATLAS, a NASA-funded early warning system.</p>
<p>On August 6, 2023, data from the Webb Space Telescope was used to analyze the comet's trajectory and mass.</p>
<p>The comet is expected to pass close to the sun after September 2023, becoming invisible, but it will reappear on the other side in early December.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The comet poses no threat to Earth,” said Avi Loeb in his blog post.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Its unusual trajectory will likely bring it close to Jupiter, Mars, and Venus,” Loeb added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is only the third recorded instance of an interstellar object entering the inner solar system. The first was 1I/'Oumuamua, detected in 2017, followed by 2I/Borisov in 2019. These discoveries have sparked interest in the study of interstellar objects and their origins.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>After passing close to the sun, 3I/ATLAS is expected to be monitored as it re-emerges in early December 2023. Further studies and observations will continue as it approaches other planets in the solar system.</p>
