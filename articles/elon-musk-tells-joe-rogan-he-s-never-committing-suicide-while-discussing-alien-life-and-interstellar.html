      <h2>Elon Musk discusses interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, claims he's 'never committing suicide'</h2>

<p>Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, has made headlines by declaring he is “never committing suicide” during a conversation with podcaster Joe Rogan about the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS and the existence of alien life. The remarks were made during a recent episode of The Joe Rogan Experience, where Musk and Rogan discussed various topics related to space exploration and extraterrestrial intelligence.</p>

<p>This discussion has drawn significant public attention, particularly Musk's comments regarding the comet, which has sparked scientific interest due to its unusual characteristics. Authorities, including NASA, have classified 3I/ATLAS as an interstellar object, confirming its origin beyond our solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object to pass through the solar system.</li>
    <li>Nikola-rich composition has led to speculation about its origins.</li>
    <li>NASA has classified 3I/ATLAS as an interstellar object based on its hyperbolic orbit.</li>
    <li>Recent observations showed a significant increase in the comet's brightness during its closest approach to the Sun.</li>
    <li>Amateur radio enthusiasts reported strange transmissions from SpaceX’s Starshield satellites coinciding with the comet's observations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In the recent episode of The Joe Rogan Experience, Musk discussed 3I/ATLAS alongside the potential for extraterrestrial life. He humorously stated, “If I ever came across solid evidence of aliens, Joe, I promise I’ll announce it on your show.”</p>
<p>Musk emphasized his commitment to transparency, stating, “I will never commit suicide, never,” in a clear declaration. The comet 3I/ATLAS has gained attention due to its unique trajectory and chemical composition since its discovery.</p>
<p>NASA confirmed the comet's classification as an interstellar object, and recent spacecraft observations revealed a bright blue hue during its closest solar pass.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “It’s possible, but if it is, it’s made of really heavy material. A nickel spaceship wouldn’t be very practical,” Musk said when asked about the comet's potential alien origins.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb described the comet as “puzzling,” noting its unusual characteristics, including a visible jet facing the Sun.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to this discussion, 3I/ATLAS has been a subject of scientific curiosity due to its unexpected behaviour. While some scientists have speculated about its non-natural origins, most astronomers attribute its anomalies to natural processes.</p>
<p>The phenomena surrounding 3I/ATLAS, including its bright blue hue and nickel-rich composition, have contributed to ongoing debates in the scientific community about the nature of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further investigations into the comet’s properties and origins are expected as scientists continue to study its trajectory and composition. The findings could provide insights into the nature of interstellar objects and the possibility of extraterrestrial life.</p>
