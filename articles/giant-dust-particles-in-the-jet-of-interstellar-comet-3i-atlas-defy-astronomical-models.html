      <h2>Giant dust particles in the jet of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS defy astronomical models</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has exhibited unusual characteristics that challenge existing astronomical models, according to scientists who have monitored the comet's behavior since its discovery in July 2025. Observations conducted in December 2025 have revealed a jet of material, known as an anti-tail, extending more than 400,000 kilometers toward the Sun, with a composition that deviates significantly from typical cometary dust.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it suggests that the comet's origin in another stellar system has resulted in unique physical properties and dynamics. Researchers are using this data to reassess current models of comet formation and material ejection. The findings may provide insights into the building blocks of planetary systems beyond our own.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025 by the ATLAS astronomical survey.</li>
    <li>The comet's closest approach to the Sun occurred in December 2025, at a distance of 1.8 astronomical units (approximately 270 million kilometers).</li>
    <li>The jet of material extends over 400,000 kilometers and is classified as an anti-tail.</li>
    <li>The estimated mass loss rate of the comet is about 500 kilograms per second.</li>
    <li>The comet follows a hyperbolic orbit with an excess speed of about 58 km/s relative to the Sun.</li>
    <li>The nucleus of the comet has a rotation period of approximately 15 hours.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered by the ATLAS survey system. Following its discovery, scientists began to monitor its trajectory and physical characteristics. Observations in December 2025 revealed the presence of an anti-tail jet, prompting further analysis of its composition and dynamics. The comet made its closest approach to the Sun later that month, providing valuable data for researchers.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The unique characteristics of the 3I/ATLAS jet force us to reconsider our models of comet dynamics,” said a lead researcher involved in the study. “This comet serves as a natural laboratory for understanding conditions in other planetary systems.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar visitor to cross our solar system. Similar comets, such as Hale-Bopp, have exhibited typical behavior dominated by submicron particles. The differences observed in 3I/ATLAS could reshape our understanding of comet formation and the materials present in other stellar systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to analyze data from 3I/ATLAS as it moves away from the Sun and out of the solar system. Future research will focus on understanding the implications of its unique jet structure and particle composition for theories of cometary evolution and interstellar materials.</p>
