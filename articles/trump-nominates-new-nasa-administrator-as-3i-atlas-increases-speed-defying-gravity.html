      <h2>Trump nominates new NASA administrator as 3I/ATLAS increases speed, defying gravity</h2>

<p>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has reported a significant increase in the speed of interstellar object 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth. The comet, which was first discovered in June, is now traveling at a speed of 152,000 mph, exceeding its previous record of 130,000 mph. This change in trajectory has raised questions about the object's behavior, which NASA states cannot be fully explained by the Sun’s gravity.</p>

<p>This development is critical as 3I/ATLAS is set to make its closest approach to Earth in just three weeks. Experts are investigating the comet's unexpected acceleration, with Harvard physicist Dr. Avi Loeb suggesting the possibility of an extraterrestrial engine powering the object. In conjunction with these findings, President Donald Trump has nominated tech billionaire Jared Isaacman to become NASA’s new administrator, replacing current acting administrator Sean Duffy.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was discovered in June 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet's speed has increased from 130,000 mph to 152,000 mph.</li>
    <li>It will reach its closest point to Earth in three weeks.</li>
    <li>Dr. Avi Loeb has raised concerns about the comet's behavior.</li>
    <li>Jared Isaacman has been nominated as NASA administrator.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified in June 2023. The comet initially entered the solar system at a speed of 130,000 mph. On October 29, 2023, it reached its closest point to the Sun and has since accelerated to 152,000 mph. The object is expected to approach Earth within three weeks, prompting increased scrutiny from scientists.</p>

<blockquote>“If the object shows no detectable gas emissions as it nears Earth,” Loeb warned, “its acceleration may be powered by an extraterrestrial engine.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is only the third recorded interstellar object to visit our solar system, highlighting the rarity and importance of such celestial phenomena. Previous interstellar visitors have also prompted scientific investigation into their origins and characteristics. The nomination of Isaacman comes amid ongoing debates about NASA's future direction and reliance on private aerospace companies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA continues to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth. Investigations will focus on understanding the object's acceleration and trajectory. The confirmation of Isaacman as NASA administrator is anticipated to influence the agency’s strategic direction in the coming months.</p>
