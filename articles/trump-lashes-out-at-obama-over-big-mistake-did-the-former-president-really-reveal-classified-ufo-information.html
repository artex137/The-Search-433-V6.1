      <h2>Trump Lashes Out at Obama Over UFO Comments</h2>
<p>A political controversy has erupted in Washington after former US President Barack Obama spoke about extraterrestrial life during a podcast interview. His remarks triggered a sharp reaction from current US President Donald Trump, who accused Obama of revealing classified information. The debate has shifted from UFO speculation to a political showdown, with Trump announcing plans to direct federal agencies to begin releasing government files related to extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Obama made comments about aliens during an interview with journalist Brian Tyler Cohen.</li>
    <li>Trump accused Obama of sharing classified information, without providing evidence.</li>
    <li>The Pentagon has examined hundreds of reports on unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP).</li>
    <li>In 2022, military officials confirmed no proof of alien visitation was found.</li>
    <li>A 2024 Pentagon report stated that most sightings involved misidentified objects.</li>
    <li>Public interest in UFO transparency has grown, with bipartisan support for more openness.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In a podcast interview, Obama discussed the possibility of extraterrestrial life and addressed conspiracy theories surrounding Area 51. He stated he saw no evidence of alien contact during his presidency. Trump's response came shortly after, where he accused Obama of disclosing classified information. Following the backlash, Trump announced intentions to instruct federal agencies, including the Department of Defense, to review and release documents related to extraterrestrial investigations.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“He gave classified information. He’s not supposed to be doing that. I don’t know if they’re real or not… I can tell you he gave classified information. He made a big mistake,”</blockquote> said Trump regarding Obama's comments.

<blockquote>“I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. Really!”</blockquote> Obama stated during the interview.

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The CIA acknowledged in 2013 that Area 51 served as a testing ground for spy planes rather than alien spacecraft. Despite the lack of evidence for alien visitation, scientists agree that life could exist elsewhere in the universe. The Milky Way galaxy contains billions of stars, many with potentially habitable planets. Current research focuses on microbial life on Mars and distant exoplanets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Trump's announcement to review and release documents related to extraterrestrial investigations is set to proceed, but it remains uncertain whether any new information will surface from these files. The ongoing debate regarding classified information and UFOs continues to capture public interest.</p>
