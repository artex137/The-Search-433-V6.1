      <h2>3I/ATLAS Comet Updates: Where Is It Now, and What Scientists Are Saying</h2>

<p>The 3I/ATLAS comet is currently making its closest approach to the sun, as it travels through our solar system. Discovered on July 1, 2025, near Jupiter, the comet is the third interstellar object known to have visited our solar system. It was identified by the ATLAS telescope in Chile, according to Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it allows scientists ample opportunity to observe and study the comet. Authorities, including NASA and the European Space Agency, are actively monitoring the comet's trajectory and its composition, which has shown signs of nickel in its surrounding gas.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to Mars:</strong> 18 million miles</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to Sun:</strong> Late October 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to Earth:</strong> 167 million miles in December 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Comet's Nucleus Size:</strong> No more than 3.5 miles across</li>
    <li><strong>Detection of Nickel:</strong> Confirmed by Instituto de Astrofísica-Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile and Michigan State University</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the 3I/ATLAS comet was discovered near Jupiter. Throughout September, it was visible through telescopes, but visibility diminished as it approached the sun. Earlier in October, the comet passed within 18 million miles of Mars. It is currently making its closest approach to the sun, with NASA predicting this event would occur in late October. The European Space Agency's Juice spacecraft is monitoring the comet's progress.</p>

<p>The comet is expected to reappear in December 2025, after it swings past the sun, although it will still be approximately 167 million miles from Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The problem is, we can’t observe it from Earth because it’s on the opposite side of the sun. So when you look at the sun during the daytime right now, 3I/ATLAS is flying behind it — perhaps for a reason,” said Avi Loeb. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “If it’s a technological object, that’s the best time for it to do a maneuver to take advantage of the sun’s gravity. That’s what we do with our own spacecraft,” Loeb added.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The 3I/ATLAS comet is part of a growing interest in interstellar objects as detection capabilities improve. Scientists are increasingly considering the implications of such objects, particularly regarding their potential to carry alien technology. Avi Loeb has emphasized the need for discussions about plans in case such technology is detected.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the comet continues its journey, NASA and other agencies will keep monitoring it closely. Observations may be limited while the comet is behind the sun, but new data is expected to emerge following its reappearance in December.</p>
