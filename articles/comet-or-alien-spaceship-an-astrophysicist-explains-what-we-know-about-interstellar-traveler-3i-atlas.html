      <h2>Comet or alien spaceship? An astrophysicist explains what we know about interstellar traveler 3I/Atlas</h2>

<p>3I/Atlas, confirmed as a comet, is one of only three interstellar objects detected entering our solar system. Discovered in July 2025, the comet has sparked significant interest among astronomers. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with its discovery.</p>

<p>This discovery is important because it provides insights into the composition of comets from other solar systems. Authorities and scientists are currently observing 3I/Atlas using advanced telescopes, including NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope, to learn more about its origins and characteristics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: Comet 3I/Atlas</li>
    <li>Discovery Date: July 2025</li>
    <li>Type: Interstellar comet</li>
    <li>Unique Composition: Carbon dioxide ice-to-water ice ratio of 8:1</li>
    <li>Observation Tools: NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope, Juno satellite</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, astronomers discovered 3I/Atlas as it entered the solar system. Initial observations suggested it might be an alien spacecraft due to its unusual light emission. However, further analysis confirmed it to be a comet, notable for forming a coma outside Jupiter's orbit.</p>

<p>Subsequent studies indicated that the comet is rich in carbon dioxide and has a unique ice composition. Scientists expect to gather more data when 3I/Atlas crosses Jupiter's orbit after October 2025, which will provide further insights into its nature.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Interstellar objects, which all seem to be comets, are the only things that we’ve ever gotten physical observations for within our solar system that originated outside our solar system,” said Jacqueline McCleary, assistant professor of physics at Northeastern University.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Clearly, the 3I/Atlas parent system maybe was really rich in carbon dioxide or maybe there were weird radiation processes that left a lot of carbon dioxide and boiled away everything else,” McCleary added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas is the third documented interstellar object observed in our solar system, following previous discoveries that have provided glimpses into the formation of other solar systems. Understanding its composition can help refine models of solar system formation and reveal the uniqueness of our own solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/Atlas approaches Jupiter's orbit later this year, scientists plan to use the Juno satellite to gather more detailed observations, which may further illuminate the comet's characteristics and origins.</p>
