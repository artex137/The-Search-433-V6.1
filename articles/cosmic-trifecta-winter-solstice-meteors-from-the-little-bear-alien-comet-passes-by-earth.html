      <h2>Cosmic trifecta: Winter Solstice, meteors from The Little Bear, ‘Alien’ comet passes by Earth</h2>

<p>Astronomical winter officially arrives on December 21 at 10:03 a.m. EST, marking the Winter Solstice for the Northern Hemisphere. On this day, the Northern Hemisphere will experience its longest night of the year while the Southern Hemisphere celebrates the Summer Solstice. There are no reported injuries or fatalities associated with these astronomical events.</p>

<p>This cosmic occurrence is significant as it not only signals the change of seasons but also provides a chance for stargazers to witness the Ursid Meteor Shower. It is expected to peak from the night of December 21 into dawn, with optimal viewing conditions due to the absence of moonlight. Additionally, Comet 3I/ATLAS will be visible, offering a unique opportunity for observation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Winter Solstice: December 21, 10:03 a.m. EST</li>
    <li>Peak of Ursid Meteor Shower: Night of December 21 to dawn</li>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS distance: Approximately 169,150,000 miles (about 272,000,000 km)</li>
    <li>Comet speed: Approximately 125,000 mph (about 201,000 km/h)</li>
    <li>Comet’s closest approach: One day prior to December 21</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On December 21, at 10:03 a.m. EST, the Northern Hemisphere will officially enter winter, coinciding with the longest night of the year. During this time, the Ursid Meteor Shower is expected to reach its peak, providing an excellent opportunity for stargazers to observe shooting stars. Additionally, Comet 3I/ATLAS, which has traveled through the galaxy for billions of years, will be visible in the night sky.</p>

<p>Early on December 21, astronomers have successfully imaged Comet 3I/ATLAS, revealing its brightness and facilitating public interest in this celestial body.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I was mesmerized looking at this interstellar comet, awed at its billions of years of age, wondering where it had traveled in our galaxy among the stars and where it would wander in the future,” said an astronomer who captured images of the comet.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Winter Solstice has long been celebrated across various cultures as a time of renewal and reflection. The occurrence of meteor showers, such as the Ursids, adds to the seasonal celebrations, drawing attention to the wonders of the night sky. Comet 3I/ATLAS, classified as an interstellar comet, adds a unique aspect to this year's astronomical events.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As winter progresses, astronomers will continue to monitor Comet 3I/ATLAS and other celestial events. Anticipation builds for upcoming astronomical phenomena, including further insights into the comet’s trajectory and characteristics.</p>
