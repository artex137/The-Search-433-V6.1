      <h2>3I/ATLAS mission: ESA spacecraft set to fly through interstellar tail</h2>

<p>Two European Space Agency (ESA) spacecraft, Hera and Europa Clipper, are set to fly through the tail of interstellar object 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the sun on October 29. The mission aims to gather data on the comet's tail, which has puzzled scientists since its discovery on July 1.</p>

<p>This mission is significant as it seeks to clarify the nature of 3I/ATLAS, which has been described as both a comet and a potential alien probe. The ESA has planned the fly-bys to measure ions emitted from the tail, which has exhibited unusual features since the comet's discovery.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> July 1</li>
    <li><strong>Perihelion Date:</strong> October 29</li>
    <li><strong>Hera Fly-Through Window:</strong> October 25 to November 1</li>
    <li><strong>Europa Clipper Fly-Through Window:</strong> October 30 to November 6</li>
    <li><strong>Agencies Involved:</strong> European Space Agency (ESA)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, sparking interest in its origin and characteristics. As the object approaches the sun, its tail has been growing and showing unusual features, prompting further investigation. The ESA has scheduled fly-bys of Hera and Europa Clipper to take place in late October and early November.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The tail's trajectory is not a simple path as it is riddled with solar winds, which can push tail particles away from the sun,” ESA researchers stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Since its discovery, 3I/ATLAS has raised questions about its composition and origin. The unusual characteristics of its tail, including water gushing and ion release, have led to diverse theories regarding its nature. The upcoming fly-bys may provide crucial data to resolve these uncertainties.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The ESA will analyze data collected from both spacecraft during their fly-bys to better understand the behavior of 3I/ATLAS and its tail. Further research may follow based on the findings from these missions.</p>
