      <h2>3I/ATLAS may be 14 billion years old, it could be universe's oldest visitor - Here is what we know</h2>

<p>Astronomers have discovered that comet 3I/ATLAS is an interstellar object entering our solar system, marking only the third confirmed visitor of its kind. The comet, which may be between eight and fourteen billion years old, challenges existing assumptions about the age of cosmic objects and offers potential insights into ancient space.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it may rewrite our understanding of cosmic history. Scientists are currently studying 3I/ATLAS to uncover clues about conditions shortly after the Big Bang, which could enhance our knowledge of star formation and cosmic evolution.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is an interstellar object first spotted in 2020 by the ATLAS survey.</li>
    <li>It is only the third interstellar visitor confirmed, following Oumuamua and Borisov.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS could be between <strong>8</strong> and <strong>14</strong> billion years old.</li>
    <li>The Sun formed approximately <strong>4.6</strong> billion years ago.</li>
    <li>Scientists are closely monitoring its activity and brightness changes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified in 2020 by the ATLAS survey. Astronomers quickly recognized it as a comet not bound to the Sun, confirming its interstellar origin. Since its discovery, scientists have examined its unusual characteristics and monitored its behavior.</p>

<p>The comet's trajectory and speed have verified its status as an interstellar traveler. Ongoing studies focus on its unique features, which suggest a formation history distinct from typical comets within our solar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS is a cosmic messenger from the universe’s youth,” scientists have said, indicating its potential to reveal conditions shortly after the Big Bang.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS adds to the growing list of interstellar objects that challenge previous ideas about the age and nature of small cosmic visitors. Prior discoveries, such as Oumuamua and Borisov, have already shifted scientific perspectives on interstellar matter.</p>

<p>Studying 3I/ATLAS may refine current models of cosmic chemistry and evolution, providing a rare glimpse into primordial matter that has remained intact over billions of years.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Observatories will continue monitoring 3I/ATLAS until it fades from view. Spectroscopic studies will further examine its elements, with findings expected to influence our understanding of star system evolution and aid in the discovery of future interstellar visitors.</p>
