      <h2>Scientists reveal strange behaviors of interstellar visitor 3I/ATLAS that deepen the mystery of its origins</h2>

<p>Scientists have observed unusual behaviors of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS as it travels through our solar system, particularly noting a reversal in its trajectory as it moved behind the sun. The latest findings, released on October 25, 2025, have raised questions about the object's origins and whether it is a typical comet or something more complex.</p>

<p>This discovery matters because it challenges the prevailing understanding of comets and their behaviors. Authorities, including NASA and various astronomers, continue to study 3I/ATLAS to gather more data on its composition and trajectory as it approaches the sun on October 29, when it is predicted to reach its closest point.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date of observation:</strong> October 25, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to the sun:</strong> October 29, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Earth:</strong> 298 million miles</li>
    <li><strong>Size estimate:</strong> Initially over 12 miles, now reduced to 1.7 miles</li>
    <li><strong>Emission rates:</strong> 5 grams of nickel and 20 grams of cyanide per second</li>
    <li><strong>CO2 emission rate:</strong> 940 trillion molecules per second</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2025. Since then, it has been closely monitored by various telescopes and research teams. In August 2025, the Two-Meter Twin Telescope in the Canary Islands captured an image of a faint jet extending from the nucleus of the object. Several studies published throughout the summer concluded that the object exhibits classic cometary behavior, despite its unusual features.</p>

<p>On October 25, 2025, scientists noted the object appeared to reverse thrust as it passed behind the sun, prompting further investigation into its origins and behavior.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Here we are talking about a potential for something that could affect humanity in the future in a dramatic way, and so you shouldn't apply the same approach of being as conservative as possible,” said Harvard physicist Avi Loeb.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “It is clearly a natural comet; suggestions to the contrary are laughed at by people who are actual comet experts,” remarked Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard–Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third recorded interstellar object to pass through our solar system, following Oumuamua in 2017 and the comet Borisov in 2019. Unlike its predecessors, 3I/ATLAS has raised significant debate within the scientific community regarding its classification due to its size and unusual emissions.</p>

<p>Previous studies have suggested that the chemical composition and behavior of 3I/ATLAS could indicate it originated from a solar system that differs significantly from our own.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches the sun, scientists will continue to monitor its trajectory and emissions. The upcoming closest approach on October 29 is expected to provide further insights into the object's characteristics and origins.</p>
