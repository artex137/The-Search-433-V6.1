      <h2>Before 3I/ATLAS, We Had These Interstellar Visitors From Beyond The Solar System; Know Where Are They Now</h2>

<p>Comet 3I ATLAS has garnered attention as the latest interstellar object detected passing through our solar system, following the discovery of its predecessor, Oumuamua, on October 19, 2017. Oumuamua was identified by the University of Hawaii’s Pan-STARRS1 telescope and is notable for being the first confirmed interstellar visitor detected in the solar system.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it expands our understanding of interstellar objects and their characteristics. Authorities in the scientific community have since focused on studying Oumuamua's unique features, including its rocky, cigar-shaped structure and reddish hue.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovery date: October 19, 2017</li>
    <li>Discovered by: University of Hawaii’s Pan-STARRS1 telescope</li>
    <li>Type: First confirmed interstellar object</li>
    <li>Appearance: Rocky, cigar-shaped with a reddish hue</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Oumuamua was discovered on October 19, 2017, as it passed through our solar system. Following its discovery, scientists began to analyze its trajectory and physical characteristics. The object sparked widespread interest in the scientific community, leading to discussions about its origins and implications for our understanding of the universe.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Oumuamua has opened a new chapter in the study of interstellar objects,” said an astronomer at the University of Hawaii, highlighting the importance of this discovery in astronomical research.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of Oumuamua is part of a growing trend in astronomy, where advancements in telescope technology have allowed scientists to detect and study objects from beyond our solar system. This has led to increased interest in understanding the potential for life and the composition of other celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers continue to investigate the characteristics of Oumuamua and its implications for future studies of interstellar objects. Further analysis may reveal more about the origins and nature of such visitors to our solar system.</p>
