      <h2>Interstellar visitor</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is approaching the sun, with its closest point expected by late October, according to a program at the University of California, Santa Cruz (UC Santa Cruz). This comet is only the third known object from outside the solar system to pass through, presenting a unique opportunity for scientific observation.</p>

<p>The comet has sparked public interest and speculation about extraterrestrial life. The UC Santa Cruz program, Shadow the Scientists, aims to provide accurate information and demystify such notions. The program allows the public to observe astronomers in real time as they study the comet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object:</strong> Comet 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery:</strong> July 2023 by NASA</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to the sun:</strong> Late October 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Public sessions:</strong> September 25 and late November 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Program:</strong> Shadow the Scientists at UC Santa Cruz</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2023 by NASA. As it approaches the sun, more of its material is expected to transform into gas, allowing scientists to analyze its composition. The comet is anticipated to reach its closest point to the sun in late October.</p>

<p>In response to the public's fascination, UC Santa Cruz launched the Shadow the Scientists program, which allows individuals to virtually observe scientists studying the comet in real time. The program also offers sessions on September 25 and late November 2023 to educate the public on 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This kind of sensationalism ends up ultimately... causing people to lose faith in more serious, evidence-based research and science,” said Raja GuhaThakurta, faculty director at UC Santa Cruz. “Part of the program's goal is to demystify that evidence-based, scientific research, by allowing people to watch it unfold in real-time.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>Jameeka Marshall from UC Santa Cruz noted, “Could this be something that aliens — another civilization — sent to us? That has been starting a conversation.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of interstellar objects is rare, with 3I/ATLAS being only the third known instance. Public curiosity often leads to speculation about extraterrestrial life, which can overshadow scientific understanding. Programs like Shadow the Scientists aim to bridge this gap and promote evidence-based research.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Shadow the Scientists will continue to hold sessions to educate the public about 3I/ATLAS. The next sessions are scheduled for September 25 and late November 2023, focusing on the comet's characteristics and significance in the study of interstellar objects.</p>
