      <h2>Nasa’s Mars probe goes dark after encounter with interstellar visitor</h2>

<p>Nasa has lost contact with its MAVEN spacecraft two weeks after its close interaction with the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, which passed Mars on December 4. The probe, which has been orbiting Mars since 2014, has stopped transmitting signals and has changed its orbit.</p>

<p>This incident raises concerns in the scientific community as MAVEN serves as a crucial communications relay for rovers exploring Mars. Nasa is now analyzing tracking information to determine the cause of the malfunction, but definitive answers will only come once the spacecraft resumes communication.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>MAVEN spacecraft went dark on December 4, 2023.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2023.</li>
    <li>MAVEN was 18 million miles away from 3I/ATLAS during its October observations.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will pass within 170 million miles of Earth today, December 8, 2023.</li>
    <li>This is the first time in a decade that a probe has gone offline due to an interstellar object.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2023, and Nasa's MAVEN spacecraft observed it in October while 18 million miles away. On December 4, during its observations, MAVEN stopped transmitting signals and changed its orbit.</p>
<p>Today, December 8, 2023, 3I/ATLAS is expected to make its closest approach to Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Nasa has stated that it is analyzing fragments of tracking information to determine what has gone wrong with MAVEN. The agency has not confirmed the exact cause of the malfunction.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third recorded interstellar object, following 'Oumuamua in 2017 and Comet 2I/Borisov in 2019. The scientific community has expressed excitement about these rare visitors, but the current situation with MAVEN has raised questions regarding Nasa's capabilities and the quality of the images taken during the encounter.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Nasa will continue to analyze tracking data while awaiting MAVEN’s return to communication. The agency has not disclosed a timeline for when it expects to regain contact with the spacecraft.</p>
