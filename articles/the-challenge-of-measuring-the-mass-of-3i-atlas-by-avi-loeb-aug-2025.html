      <h2>The Challenge of Measuring the Mass of 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>A team of astronomers is currently grappling with the complexities of determining the mass of comet <strong>3I/ATLAS</strong>, an interstellar object that has captured significant attention since its detection. Observations conducted from August 8 to 12, 2025, have suggested that the nucleus of 3I/ATLAS could have a diameter of 46 kilometers, but this remains uncertain due to limitations in available data.</p>

<p>This research is crucial as it could help scientists better understand the composition and characteristics of interstellar objects. The findings may influence future studies and models related to similar celestial bodies. Astronomers are employing various methods to measure the mass, including analyzing the mass loss rate as 3I/ATLAS approaches the Sun.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
<li>Diameter: Estimated at 46 kilometers</li>
<li>Mass loss rate: Inferred at 129 kilograms per second</li>
<li>Outflow speed: Estimated at 0.44 kilometers per second</li>
<li>Observation dates: August 8-12, 2025</li>
<li>Non-gravitational acceleration: Approximately 6x10<sup>-11</sup> centimeters per second squared</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On August 8-12, 2025, observations from the <strong>SPHEREx</strong> space observatory detected significant flux from 3I/ATLAS, indicating a potential large nucleus or a dust cloud surrounding it. Data from the <strong>Webb telescope</strong> was used to infer the mass loss rate of CO2, which is crucial for calculating the mass of the comet.</p>

<p>Researchers have noted that the mass of 3I/ATLAS could be approximately 10<sup>20</sup> grams if the nucleus is solid. However, the actual mass remains uncertain due to the model-dependent nature of the theoretical inferences drawn from the data.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Measuring the mass of 3I/ATLAS would tightly constrain its size,” said Avi Loeb, a leading astronomer involved in the research.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The rocket equation provides a viable method for measuring the mass of small objects like 3I/ATLAS,” Loeb added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The study of interstellar objects has gained momentum following the discovery of <strong>1I/`Oumuamua</strong> in 2017 and <strong>2I/Borisov</strong> in 2019. These findings have prompted researchers to explore the physical characteristics and behaviors of such celestial bodies, which differ significantly from those within our solar system.</p>

<p>Understanding the mass and composition of objects like 3I/ATLAS is essential for improving models of planetary formation and the dynamics of material in interstellar space.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun. Future observations are expected to provide more data, allowing for a more accurate measurement of its mass and, consequently, its size.</p>
