      <h2>Is Comet 3I/Atlas Alien-Made? NASA Rejects Harvard Astronomer’s Claims</h2>

<p>NASA has rejected claims by Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb that interstellar comet 3I/Atlas might be a product of alien technology. The comet was discovered on July 1 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-Impact Last Alert System (Atlas) survey telescope in Río Hurtado, Chile. It is only the third known interstellar object to pass through our solar system.</p>

<p>This matter has sparked significant debate in the scientific community. Loeb's assertions have raised questions about the nature of interstellar objects and their implications for humanity. NASA has conducted extensive studies on 3I/Atlas and maintains that the comet poses no threat to Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered: July 1, 2023</li>
    <li>Location of discovery: Río Hurtado, Chile</li>
    <li>Comet size: Up to 3.5 miles (5.6 km) wide</li>
    <li>Speed: 130,000 mph (209,000 km/h)</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: Approximately 270 kilometers</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2023, the Asteroid Terrestrial-Impact Last Alert System (Atlas) survey telescope discovered comet 3I/Atlas. Shortly thereafter, Avi Loeb published a paper suggesting the comet might be of alien origin due to its unusual trajectory and lack of a visible tail.</p>

<p>In October, Loeb speculated about the possibility of the comet performing a maneuver while hidden behind the sun, hinting at "malign intent," though he recognized this as a theoretical notion.</p>

<p>NASA has since studied 3I/Atlas and confirmed that it behaves like a natural comet, dismissing Loeb's theories as unfounded.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “It looks like a comet. It does comet things. It very, very strongly resembles, in just about every way, the comets that we know,” said Tom Statler, NASA’s lead scientist for solar system small bodies.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “The evidence is overwhelmingly pointing to this object being a natural body. It’s a comet,” Statler added.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is not the first time a scientific hypothesis regarding extraterrestrial life has generated controversy. Loeb's Galileo Project aims to search for evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence and has previously faced skepticism from the broader scientific community. The discovery of interstellar objects like 3I/Atlas has opened new avenues for research into the origins and compositions of other solar systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to monitor comet 3I/Atlas as it approaches Mars, Jupiter, and Venus over the coming months. The agency aims to gather more data about the comet's characteristics and behavior during its journey through the solar system.</p>
