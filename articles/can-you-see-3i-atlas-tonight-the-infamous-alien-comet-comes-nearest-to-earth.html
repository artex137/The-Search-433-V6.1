      <h2>Can You See 3I/ATLAS Tonight? The Infamous 'Alien' Comet Comes Nearest to Earth</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar object, is making its closest approach to Earth on 19 December 2025, passing within about 1.8 astronomical units, or approximately 168 million miles (270 million kilometres) away. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this event.</p>

<p>The approach of 3I/ATLAS has generated significant interest among scientists and the public, leading to various theories about its origins. NASA and other space agencies are monitoring the comet, but they assert there is no credible evidence to support claims of alien technology.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Event Date:</strong> 19 December 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Earth:</strong> 1.8 astronomical units (168 million miles / 270 million kilometres)</li>
    <li><strong>Visibility:</strong> Not visible to the naked eye; requires telescopes</li>
    <li><strong>Recommended telescope size:</strong> At least 15 centimetres aperture</li>
    <li><strong>Location in sky:</strong> Near the star Regulus in the constellation Leo</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on 1 July 2025 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) survey telescope in Chile. It quickly gained attention due to its classification as an interstellar object, being the third confirmed interstellar object detected after 1I/&#699;Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019.</p>

<p>As it neared the Sun, 3I/ATLAS developed a coma and tail typical of comets, which has intrigued researchers. Recent observations have shown the comet glowing green as it sheds gases, further fueling public interest and speculation about its nature.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Despite the intrigue, there is no credible indication of alien technology,” said a NASA spokesperson.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has remarked on the comet’s light curve, suggesting that oddities might imply unusual internal processes, describing apparent periodic pulses in its coma as a ‘heartbeat’.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The public fascination with 3I/ATLAS mirrors previous reactions to interstellar visitors, particularly 1I/&#699;Oumuamua. The unusual characteristics of these objects often spark theories regarding alien technology, though most scientists maintain they are natural phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the comet approaches, astronomers will continue to observe it closely. Live streams from projects like the Virtual Telescope Project will provide real-time views for those unable to use telescopes. Further studies may clarify the nature and behavior of 3I/ATLAS as it passes through our solar system.</p>
