      <h2>3I/ATLAS Comet Raises Questions About Einstein's Theory</h2>
<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has seemingly confirmed Albert Einstein's 1915 theory of general relativity as it made its closest approach to the Sun on October 29, 2023. Astronomers observed gravitational lensing effects, where the Sun’s gravity bent the light from the comet, but the object also exhibited unexpected behavior that has raised further questions about its classification as a comet.</p>

<p>This observation is significant as it provides a rare opportunity to witness Einstein's predictions applied to a moving interstellar object within our solar system. According to Harvard professor Avi Loeb, the observed shift in 3I/ATLAS's position exceeded initial predictions, prompting discussions about its true nature and origin.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event date: October 29, 2023</li>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Location: Closest approach to the Sun</li>
    <li>Observed position shift: four arcseconds</li>
    <li>Initial predicted shift: 0.27 arcseconds</li>
    <li>Mass loss required for comet classification: approximately 5 billion tons</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 29, 2023, 3I/ATLAS reached its closest approach to the Sun. Astronomers noted that the Sun's gravity caused the light from the comet to bend, confirming Einstein's gravitational lensing theory. However, the shift observed was greater than what scientists had predicted, leading to questions about the object’s nature.</p>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has publicly discussed the anomalies associated with 3I/ATLAS, stating that conventional comets should exhibit significant mass loss during such close solar encounters. The absence of a visible cloud of gas and dust raises concerns about its classification.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "If there’s no such cloud, it could suggest that 3I/ATLAS is not a natural object."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Gravitational lensing has been observed in the past around stars and galaxies, but 3I/ATLAS presents a unique case due to its status as an interstellar visitor. Scientists have long studied the behavior of comets, but the peculiar characteristics of 3I/ATLAS challenge existing classifications.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS and analyze its behavior. Further investigations will focus on determining whether the object is indeed a comet and exploring its origin and composition.</p>
