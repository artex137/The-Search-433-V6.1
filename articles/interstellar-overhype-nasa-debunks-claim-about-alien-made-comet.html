      <h2>Interstellar overhype: Nasa debunks claim about alien-made comet</h2>

<p>Nasa has dismissed a theory proposed by Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb, which suggested that Comet 3I/ATLAS, set for a close pass with Mars next month, could be an artificial object created by an extraterrestrial civilization. The comet was discovered on 1 July by the Asteroid Terrestrial-Impact Last Alert System (Atlas) survey telescope in Río Hurtado, Chile. Nasa stated that the comet poses no threat to Earth.</p>

<p>This matter is significant as it highlights the ongoing search for extraterrestrial intelligence and the scientific scrutiny such claims receive. Nasa has been observing Comet 3I/ATLAS closely using ground and space telescopes since its discovery, and experts emphasize that the object behaves like a natural comet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on 1 July 2025 in Río Hurtado, Chile.</li>
    <li>The comet is approximately 5.6 km wide and travels at 209,000 km/h.</li>
    <li>Nasa has stated it poses no threat to Earth.</li>
    <li>The comet will make close passes with Mars, Jupiter, and Venus.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb is the head of Harvard University’s Galileo Project.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 1 July 2025, Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered by the Atlas survey telescope in Río Hurtado, Chile. Following its discovery, Nasa began monitoring the comet with various telescopes. In a July scientific paper, Avi Loeb presented his hypothesis regarding the comet potentially being an artificial object. In September, Nasa publicly refuted Loeb's claims, asserting that the comet behaves like a natural celestial body.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Nasa’s lead scientist for solar system small bodies, Tom Statler, stated, “It looks like a comet. It does comet things. It very, very strongly resembles, in just about every way, the comets that we know.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Statler added, “The evidence is overwhelmingly pointing to this object being a natural body. It’s a comet.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident comes amid increasing interest in the search for extraterrestrial life, especially following previous claims about unidentified aerial phenomena and other celestial observations. Loeb’s hypothesis, while provocative, reflects a broader trend in the scientific community to explore unconventional ideas while maintaining rigorous standards of evidence.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Nasa will continue to monitor Comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Mars in the coming weeks, gathering more data to enhance understanding of interstellar comets and their characteristics.</p>
