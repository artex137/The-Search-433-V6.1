      <h2>CIA makes shocking statement about mysterious interstellar visitor that challenges NASA's version of the comet</h2>

<p>The CIA has issued a statement regarding the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, which is currently moving through our solar system, raising questions about NASA’s classification of the object as a comet. This statement follows a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request filed in November 2025 by researcher John Greenewald Jr. The CIA has not confirmed or denied the existence of documents related to 3I/ATLAS, according to the agency.</p>

<p>This development has prompted renewed scrutiny of NASA's position on 3I/ATLAS, which the agency has insisted is a natural comet. Harvard professor Avi Loeb has challenged this assertion, citing unexplained behaviors exhibited by the object. As 3I/ATLAS approaches Jupiter on March 16, 2026, these revelations from the CIA may indicate that the government is investigating the possibility of a threat posed by the object.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object designation: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Discovery date: July 2025</li>
    <li>FOIA request submitted: November 2025</li>
    <li>Approaching Jupiter: March 16, 2026</li>
    <li>Researcher: John Greenewald Jr.</li>
    <li>Professor challenging NASA: Avi Loeb</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025. NASA classified it as a comet, asserting it showed no signs of extraterrestrial life. In November 2025, John Greenewald Jr. submitted a FOIA request for information related to 3I/ATLAS. The CIA responded with a “Glomar response,” indicating they would not disclose any information.</p>

<p>In November 2025, NASA Administrator Nicky Fox stated that there was no evidence to suggest 3I/ATLAS was anything other than a comet. However, this announcement raised more questions than it answered, particularly due to the unclear images released by NASA.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “It is surprising that this information is treated as sensitive to the point of being classified by the CIA, given that NASA officials firmly stated on November 19, 2025 that 3I/ATLAS is undoubtedly a comet of natural origin.” 
    <strong>- Avi Loeb</strong>
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The CIA's response has reignited longstanding conspiracy theories regarding governmental transparency on extraterrestrial matters. The agency's cryptic reply adds to the narrative that the US government may be concealing information about unidentified flying objects (UFOs) and potential extraterrestrial life.</p>

<p>In December 2025, the documentary “The Age of Disclosure” premiered, featuring interviews with 34 officials discussing alleged government cover-ups related to UFOs. Despite these claims, the US military has stated there is no physical evidence supporting the existence of extraterrestrial beings.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Greenewald Jr. plans to appeal the CIA’s FOIA response for further clarity. He has also submitted similar information requests to NASA and other US agencies, with responses pending.</p>
