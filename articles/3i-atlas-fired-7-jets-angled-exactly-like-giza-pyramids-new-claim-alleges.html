      <h2>3I/ATLAS 'Fired 7 Jets' Angled 'Exactly Like Giza Pyramids', New Claim Alleges</h2>

<p>A new claim regarding the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has emerged, suggesting that it emitted seven visible jets angled similarly to the Great Pyramids of Giza. The phenomenon was recorded on 8 November 2025, as the comet passed approximately 29 degrees from the Sun, according to astronomers.</p>

<p>This claim has sparked interest among both astronomers and conspiracy theorists. Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb confirmed that telescopic images captured the comet displaying a glowing halo nearly half a million kilometres wide. While some supporters believe the jets indicate a deeper cosmic connection, scientists caution against drawing conclusions, noting that natural cometary activity can produce such jets.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of observation: 8 November 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from the Sun: approximately 29 degrees</li>
    <li>Extent of halo: nearly 500,000 kilometres</li>
    <li>Number of jets: at least seven</li>
    <li>Key astronomers involved: M. Jager, G. Rhemann, E. Prosperi</li>
    <li>Notable claim: jets angled between 38° and 39°</li>
    <li>Estimated match with pyramid slopes: 99% with a margin of error below one degree</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 8 November 2025, astronomers observed 3I/ATLAS as it traveled through the Solar System. The comet was recorded emitting multiple jets while located approximately 29 degrees from the Sun. Under bright moonlight, images captured the jets, revealing a massive halo and at least seven distinct jet formations.</p>
<p>Following these observations, David Sereda analyzed the image data and claimed that the jets' angular spread matched the slopes of the Great Pyramids of Giza, igniting discussion about potential connections between ancient architecture and cosmic phenomena.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb noted, "3I/ATLAS has the most wildly stretched orbit ever observed," describing it as "a true interstellar traveller."</blockquote>
<blockquote>David Sereda stated, "The angular spread of the seven jets matches the pyramid slopes found at the Giza Plateau," arguing that the Great Pyramid's design may encode "tracking data for celestial bodies."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident marks one of the most detailed observations of a non-Solar System object since 2I/Borisov's passage in 2019. The claim about the comet's jets has stirred debate, with some people speculating about a connection between ancient Egyptian architecture and celestial alignments. Critics, however, argue that optical effects and natural gas release could explain the observed shapes.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it moves away from the inner Solar System. Further observations may provide additional insights into the comet's behavior and any potential links to ancient structures.</p>
