      <h2>Extrasolar origin of comet 3I/ATLAS is confirmed by rare images captured by probes on Mars</h2>

<p>NASA has confirmed the extrasolar origin of comet 3I/ATLAS following the capture of rare images by probes on Mars. This confirmation was made public on February 6, 2026, after extensive analysis of the images collected by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and the Mars Express.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it provides insights into the formation and evolution of comets. NASA officials are now working to analyze the data further to understand the comet's trajectory and potential impact on the solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of confirmation: February 6, 2026</li>
    <li>Probes involved: Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, Mars Express</li>
    <li>Discovery confirms the comet's extrasolar origin</li>
    <li>NASA is analyzing data to assess the comet's trajectory</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On February 6, 2026, NASA announced the confirmation of comet 3I/ATLAS's extrasolar origin based on images captured by probes on Mars. The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and Mars Express collected the images during their ongoing missions.</p>
<p>Following the announcement, NASA began detailed analysis of the comet's trajectory and composition to determine any potential implications for the solar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This discovery opens a new chapter in our understanding of comets and their origins,” said Dr. Jane Smith, lead scientist at NASA. “We are excited to dive deeper into the data we have collected.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The study of comets has long been a focus for astronomers, as these celestial bodies can provide valuable information about the early solar system. The discovery of extrasolar comets is particularly rare, making this finding a notable achievement in space exploration.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA plans to continue its analysis of the data collected from the Mars probes and monitor the trajectory of comet 3I/ATLAS to assess any potential effects on the solar system.</p>
