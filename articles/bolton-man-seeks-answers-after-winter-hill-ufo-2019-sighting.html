      <h2>Bolton man seeks answers after Winter Hill UFO 2019 sighting</h2>

<p>A Farnworth man is searching for answers after witnessing strange lights over Winter Hill in Bolton on October 2, 2019. Joe Henderson, 29, saw the lights while he was with two friends, Luke and James, around 9 p.m. The sighting has sparked interest due to its unexplained nature and historical context in the area.</p>

<p>The investigation into the sighting highlights ongoing curiosity about UFOs in Bolton. Authorities and local groups have been contacted for insights, but no definitive explanations have emerged. Joe Henderson continues to seek clarity on his experience as more residents come forward with similar accounts.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date of sighting:</strong> October 2, 2019</li>
    <li><strong>Time of sighting:</strong> Approximately 9 p.m.</li>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> Winter Hill, Bolton</li>
    <li><strong>Witnesses:</strong> Joe Henderson and two friends</li>
    <li><strong>Previous sightings:</strong> Reported since the 1950s</li>
    <li><strong>Recent sighting:</strong> October 6, 2023, by Stephen Maloney</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 2, 2019, Joe Henderson and his friends visited Winter Hill and observed ten evenly spaced lights in the sky. They left in a panic, unable to identify the source of the lights. In the years since, other residents have reported similar sightings, notably The Murphy Incident in 1999, where a local farmer claimed to see a UFO hovering above his cattle field.</p>

<p>The most recent sighting occurred on October 6, 2023, when Stephen Maloney reported seeing a bright white light moving silently over the moors near Tottington.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It was around 9 p.m., and when we got into the car to go home, I saw 10 evenly spaced lights going over the hill. They were really close, so in a panic, we just drove off. I can’t explain what it could have been.”</blockquote>
<p>- Joe Henderson</p>

<blockquote>“There are always lots of walkers, runners and cyclists with bright torches up on the moor. At night, it’s very easy to lose depth and distance perception, so objects can appear like they are moving in very strange ways.”</blockquote>
<p>- Colin Liptrot, BWOAS committee chairperson</p>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>UFO sightings in Bolton have a history dating back to the 1950s, with various accounts contributing to local folklore. The Murphy Incident in 1999 involved multiple witnesses and led to an investigation by the Manchester Aerial Phenomena Investigation Team (MAPIT), although no conclusions were reached. Recent reports indicate that public interest in UFO phenomena remains high.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Joe Henderson continues to seek answers regarding his sighting from 2019. As interest in UFO sightings grows, local authorities and the community may explore further investigations into the unexplained phenomena in Bolton.</p>
