      <h2>Detection of radio signals from comet 3I/ATLAS boosts NASA’s planetary defense</h2>

<p>The detection of radio signals from comet 3I/ATLAS has prompted NASA to activate its planetary defense protocol as of October 24, 2025. This event highlights the increasing need for international cooperation to protect Earth from potential cosmic threats.</p>

<p>The discovery, made by the ATLAS tracking system on July 1, 2025, has marked the identification of the third known interstellar object. NASA has mobilized its planetary defense team to analyze the comet's emissions and assess its behavior. The agency aims to enhance global response mechanisms to such phenomena.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS travels at an estimated speed of <strong>100,000 kilometers per hour</strong>.</li>
    <li>Radio signals were recorded on <strong>October 24, 2025</strong>, by the MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa.</li>
    <li>The comet's closest approach to Earth is scheduled for <strong>December 19, 2025</strong>, at a distance of <strong>27 million kilometers</strong>.</li>
    <li>Nasa conducted a large-scale simulation exercise in <strong>August 2025</strong> focused on 3I/ATLAS.</li>
    <li>The comet's emissions could indicate a new phase of activity, potentially classifying it as a hyperactive interstellar object.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the ATLAS tracking system first identified comet 3I/ATLAS, marking a significant moment in the study of interstellar objects. Following this discovery, NASA activated its planetary defense team to begin detailed analyses.</p>
<p>On October 24, 2025, the MeerKAT radio telescope detected radio signals from the comet, confirming their origin as intrinsic to the celestial body. This validation was essential for further studies.</p>
<p>The comet is expected to make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, providing a unique opportunity for scientists to conduct observations and gather critical data.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The activation of NASA’s planetary defense team reflects the urgency to protect the planet from space threats,” said a NASA spokesperson.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The detection of comet 3I/ATLAS underscores a growing trend in the need for enhanced monitoring of interstellar objects. Previous interstellar bodies, such as 2I/Borisov, have provided valuable insights into the formation and evolution of solar systems.</p>
<p>NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) are engaged in ongoing collaborative efforts to improve planetary defense capabilities, focusing on data collection and modeling of comet behavior.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue its analysis of comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth. The agency aims to refine its planetary defense strategies based on findings from this event and enhance global cooperation in monitoring potential space threats.</p>
