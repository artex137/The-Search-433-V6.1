      <h2>Comet 31/ATLAS Confirmed as Natural Object Following Radio Signal Detection</h2>

<p>Astronomers have confirmed that Comet 31/ATLAS is a naturally occurring interstellar comet, not an alien probe, following the detection of a radio signal on October 24, 2025. The signal was captured by South Africa’s MeerKAT radio telescope as the comet approached its closest point to the Sun.</p>

<p>This discovery puts to rest weeks of speculation and conspiracy theories regarding the comet's origin. The detection of a chemical fingerprint of water vapor indicates typical cometary activity, which has significant implications for our understanding of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 31/ATLAS detected radio signal on October 24, 2025.</li>
    <li>Signal captured by MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa.</li>
    <li>Signal identified as a chemical fingerprint of water being vaporized.</li>
    <li>Findings confirmed that the comet is behaving naturally.</li>
    <li>Previous theories suggested the comet could be an alien probe.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 24, 2025, researchers using the MeerKAT telescope detected a distinct radio signal from Comet 31/ATLAS as it neared its perihelion. This marked the first time a radio signal has been recorded from an interstellar comet.</p>
<p>Following the detection, scientists analyzed the signal and confirmed it was a natural occurrence related to the comet's water content.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The radio signature is exactly what we’d expect from a water-rich comet,” one astronomer explained. “It tells us this object is behaving in a completely natural way — there’s nothing alien about it.”
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to this discovery, Comet 31/ATLAS generated significant interest on social media and discussions, including mentions on The Joe Rogan Experience. Speculation about its origin had led to various conspiracy theories suggesting it was an extraterrestrial probe.</p>
<p>This finding aligns with ongoing research into interstellar objects, emphasizing the importance of scientific inquiry in distinguishing between natural phenomena and speculative theories.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor Comet 31/ATLAS as it travels through the solar system, further analyzing its composition and behavior to enhance our understanding of interstellar comets.</p>
