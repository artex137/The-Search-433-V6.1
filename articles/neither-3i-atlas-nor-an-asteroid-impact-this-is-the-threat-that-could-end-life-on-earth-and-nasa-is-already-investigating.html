      <h2>New Cosmic Threat Detected by NASA</h2>
<p>NASA has identified a new cosmic phenomenon that could threaten life on Earth, separate from known threats such as comet 3I/ATLAS and the asteroids 1I/Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. The warning comes following the detection of X-rays emitted from a supernova, which could have effects on planets over 100 light years away. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it highlights a previously unrecognized risk posed by supernovae. NASA has initiated investigations into 31 supernovae to gather more data on this finding. The agency's Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, set to launch in 2027, will play a crucial role in studying these cosmic events.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>NASA has detected a new cosmic threat from supernovae.</li>
    <li>X-rays from supernovae can affect planets over 100 light years away.</li>
    <li>NASA is analyzing 31 supernovae for further data.</li>
    <li>The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will launch in 2027.</li>
    <li>Masao Sako from the University of Pennsylvania is involved in the research.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>A team of astronomers has recently detected a new type of risk associated with supernovae. The X-rays emitted during a supernova explosion can have far-reaching effects on planets located over 100 light years from the source. NASA has begun its investigation into this phenomenon, with plans to analyze 31 supernovae for additional insights.</p>
<p>The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope is expected to be launched in 2027 and will be tasked with studying Type Ia supernovae, which will help measure the expansion of the universe.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“A new threat to life on the planet has been detected. As if we didn’t have enough with asteroids, volcanoes, typhoons and tsunamis, now comes a new threat,” said a popular science account on TikTok.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Roman is designed to find tens of thousands of Type Ia supernovae at distances never seen before,” said Masao Sako of the University of Pennsylvania. “Using them, we can measure the history of the expansion of the universe, which depends on the amount of matter and dark energy.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This discovery adds to the growing list of cosmic phenomena that could potentially endanger life on Earth. Previous incidents involving asteroid impacts and other natural disasters have raised awareness of the vulnerabilities faced by our planet. The understanding of supernovae and their effects is still developing, and this new threat emphasizes the need for continued research.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA will continue to analyze the 31 supernovae to confirm the findings regarding X-ray exposure. The launch of the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope in 2027 will further enhance our understanding of supernovae and their potential impact on life on Earth.</p>
