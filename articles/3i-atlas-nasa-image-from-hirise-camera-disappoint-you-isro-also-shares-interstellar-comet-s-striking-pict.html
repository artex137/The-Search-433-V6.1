      <h2>NASA and ISRO Share Updates on Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>
<p>NASA and ISRO have released new images and data regarding the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which was captured by the HiRISE camera on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and a telescope at Mount Abu, respectively. The NASA image, taken on October 2, 2025, has sparked discussions about its clarity, while ISRO's findings provide additional insights into the comet's characteristics.</p>

<p>The release of the NASA image has raised questions among the public regarding the resolution and clarity of the view. NASA stated that the image was the closest possible view due to the comet’s trajectory, but many social media users expressed disappointment, claiming the image did not meet expectations for detail. Meanwhile, ISRO’s observations provided a clearer understanding of the comet's behavior after perihelion.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Image Date:</strong> October 2, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Observation Period:</strong> November 12 to 15, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Telescope Used:</strong> 1.2 m telescope at Mount Abu</li>
    <li><strong>Altitude of Mount Abu:</strong> 1680 m</li>
    <li><strong>Production Rate:</strong> Approximately 10²⁵ molecules per second</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 2, 2025, NASA captured an image of 3I/ATLAS using the HiRISE camera on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Following the release of this image, discussions emerged online regarding its clarity and the limitations of the imaging technology.</p>
<p>Between November 12 and 15, 2025, ISRO's Physical Research Laboratory conducted observations of the comet using a telescope at Mount Abu, leading to the collection of imaging and spectroscopic data.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The HiRISE camera is designed for Martian surface imaging, not for capturing detailed views of fast-moving interstellar objects far from the spacecraft,” NASA explained regarding the image limitations.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The calculated production rates for the major molecular bands were around 10²⁵ molecules per second, placing the comet in the category of ‘typical comets’ in the Solar system,” said the PRL team.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The HiRISE camera has previously produced detailed images of the Martian surface, leading to high expectations for interstellar object imaging. The limitations of the camera for capturing fast-moving objects have now been highlighted by the recent discussion surrounding 3I/ATLAS.</p>
<p>ISRO's observations contribute to the ongoing study of comets, providing valuable data on their composition and behavior as they approach the Sun.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>ISRO plans to continue monitoring 3I/ATLAS as it moves into darker skies, which will allow for easier tracking and further analysis of its characteristics.</p>
