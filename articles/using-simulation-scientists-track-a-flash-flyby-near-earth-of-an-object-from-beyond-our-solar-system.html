      <h2>Scientists Track Comet 3I/Atlas Flyby Near Earth</h2>
<p>Scientists have tracked the passage of comet 3I/Atlas during its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025. The comet, identified in July 2025, reached perihelion on October 30, 2025, at a distance of approximately 270 million kilometres from Earth.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it adds to the growing body of knowledge regarding interstellar objects. Agencies like NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) have utilized numerical simulations to better understand these celestial visitors. The research aims to uncover the materials that make up the comet, which could provide insights into the formation of planetary systems beyond our solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas identified in July 2025.</li>
    <li>Perihelion reached on October 30, 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth occurred on December 19, 2025, at approximately 270 million kilometres.</li>
    <li>Comet's speed exceeded 64 kilometres per second, projected to increase to over 66 kilometres per second during the flyby.</li>
    <li>NASA and ESA are using advanced numerical simulations to study the comet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, scientists identified comet 3I/Atlas, marking it as the third known interstellar object. On October 30, 2025, the comet reached its closest point to the Sun, known as perihelion. Following this, on December 19, 2025, 3I/Atlas made its closest pass by Earth.</p>

<p>Researchers used a digital model built with Ansys STK software to analyze the comet's trajectory and compare it with those of previous interstellar visitors, ʻOumuamua and Borisov. This model also illustrated the comet’s extraordinary speed.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Comet 3I/Atlas provides a rare chance to deepen our understanding of objects that originate beyond our own star system,” said a scientist involved in the research.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The increasing precision of numerical simulations is transforming astronomy, allowing us to optimize observation schedules and maximize scientific returns from these rare events,” noted an ESA representative.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of interstellar objects has become a focal point for astronomers since the detection of ʻOumuamua in 2017. This object raised important questions about the composition and origin of interstellar bodies. Following that, Borisov confirmed the existence of interstellar comets. Comet 3I/Atlas continues to expand this rapidly evolving field of research.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to analyze data collected during the comet's flyby to identify its materials. This ongoing investigation aims to reveal vital information about the evolution of planetary systems beyond our solar system.</p>
