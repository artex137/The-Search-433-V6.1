      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Approaches Perihelion in October 2025</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS (formally C/2025 N1) is set to reach perihelion on October 29, 2025, as it travels at a speed of 68 km/s through our solar system. Discovered by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) on July 1, 2023, from its Río Hurtado station in Chile, this comet marks the third confirmed visitor from beyond our solar system.</p>

<p>The arrival of 3I/ATLAS is significant as it offers a unique opportunity for scientific study and public observation. Astronomers and space agencies are preparing to track its trajectory and analyze its composition, which may provide insights into the early solar system and the origins of comets.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> July 1, 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Perihelion Date:</strong> October 29, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> 68 km/s</li>
    <li><strong>Distance at Perihelion:</strong> 1.356 AU</li>
    <li><strong>Previous Close Approaches:</strong> Mars (0.194 AU on October 3, 2025), Venus (0.649 AU on November 3, 2025), Earth (1.797 AU on December 19, 2025)</li>
    <li><strong>Initial Designation:</strong> A11pl3Z</li>
    <li><strong>Orbital Type:</strong> Hyperbolic (interstellar)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2023, 3I/ATLAS was flagged by ATLAS as an object of interest. Two days later, it was reclassified as comet C/2025 N1 after confirmation by the Minor Planet Center. Precovery observations from NASA's TESS satellite indicated a developing coma as early as May 7, 2023. The comet's trajectory has been tracked as it approaches perihelion, with significant close encounters planned with Mars, Venus, and Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The discovery of 3I/ATLAS demonstrates the power of modern astronomical techniques in identifying and classifying celestial objects,” said a spokesperson for the ATLAS project.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar comet recorded, following 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Its hyperbolic trajectory suggests it is an unbound object, unlike long-period comets like Hale-Bopp, which has a well-defined orbit. This highlights the diversity of cometary bodies and their origins in the galaxy.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches perihelion, astronomers will continue to monitor its trajectory and composition. Observational campaigns are planned to gather data that may reveal more about its origins and characteristics, potentially leading to new discoveries about interstellar objects.</p>
