      <h2>3I ATLAS, third interstellar object to enter solar system, million times bigger than previous two</h2>

<p>3I ATLAS, the third confirmed interstellar object, has entered the solar system. Discovered by NASA’s ATLAS telescope on July 1, 2025, the comet's nucleus is reported to be several times larger than that of the previous two interstellar objects, 1I/`Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant for astrophysics and our understanding of interstellar objects. Harvard scientist Avi Loeb has noted anomalies related to 3I ATLAS, including its mass and unusual acceleration, which he speculates might indicate an internal engine. Loeb has also suggested a 40% chance that the comet could be alien technology.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date of discovery:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Object size:</strong> About one million times more massive than 1I/`Oumuamua</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Faster than both 1I/`Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov</li>
    <li><strong>Research cited:</strong> "Rapid Brightening of 3I/ATLAS Ahead of Perihelion" by Qicheng Zhang and Karl Battams</li>
    <li><strong>Notable claims:</strong> 40% chance of being alien technology</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by NASA's ATLAS telescope. Since its discovery, Avi Loeb has conducted multiple observations, noting its size and speed. He has raised questions about the comet's acceleration, suggesting it may be driven by an internal mechanism.</p>

<p>Loeb has also stated that the comet is becoming bluer than the sun, as reported in the research by Zhang and Battams.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Its nucleus is about a million times more massive than 1I/`Oumuamua and a thousand times more massive than 2I/Borisov, while moving faster than both, altogether with a likelihood of less than 0.1%,” said Avi Loeb in his blog.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>1I/`Oumuamua was the first confirmed interstellar object, discovered in 2017. It is characterized by its elongated, cigar-like shape and reddish hue. 2I/Borisov, discovered in 2019, is the first confirmed interstellar comet and has been monitored by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope.</p>

<p>Both previous objects have provided valuable insights into the formation and characteristics of solar systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I ATLAS as it approaches perihelion, aiming to gather more data on its composition and behavior.</p>
