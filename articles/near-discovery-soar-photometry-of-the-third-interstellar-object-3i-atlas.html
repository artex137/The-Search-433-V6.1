      <h2>Near-Discovery SOAR Photometry of the Third Interstellar Object: 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, and has been observed multiple times using the Southern Astrophysical Research Telescope (SOAR) in Chile. The observations occurred on July 3, July 9, and July 10, 2025, with researchers reporting no significant long-term changes in brightness during these periods.</p>

<p>The findings from these observations contribute to the understanding of interstellar objects, which are rare and provide insights into the formation and evolution of celestial bodies. Researchers have utilized photometric data to compile a growing light curve for 3I/ATLAS, which is crucial for studying its characteristics and behavior.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date of discovery:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Observation dates:</strong> July 3, 9, and 10, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Telescope used:</strong> Southern Astrophysical Research Telescope (SOAR)</li>
    <li><strong>Mean brightness:</strong> 18.14 (July 3), 17.55 (July 9), 17.54 (July 10)</li>
    <li><strong>Photometric data points:</strong> 28</li>
    <li><strong>Brightening events:</strong> Two observed on July 9 and July 10</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025. Following this, photometric observations were conducted on July 3, July 9, and July 10, 2025. During these observations, researchers noted two instances of moderate brightening, although further analysis attributed these changes to external factors such as stellar contamination.</p>

<p>The mean brightness recorded during the observations did not indicate any significant variability, suggesting stable activity levels for the comet. The data collected has been integrated into a larger light curve that includes information from various telescopes.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The activity of 3I/ATLAS on July 9 and July 10 was consistent with the near-discovery activity levels, with no obvious outburst activity,” said Tessa T. Frincke, one of the researchers involved in the study.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object detected, joining a limited but growing population of similar celestial bodies. The photometric observations contribute to ongoing research into the nature and behavior of interstellar objects, which are essential for understanding the dynamics of our solar system and beyond.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS and analyze additional data as it becomes available. Future observations may provide further insights into the comet's characteristics and activity levels.</p>
