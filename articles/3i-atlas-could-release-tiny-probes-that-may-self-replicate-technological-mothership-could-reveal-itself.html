      <h2>3I/Atlas could release tiny probes that may 'self-replicate'</h2>

<p>Interstellar object 3I/Atlas is expected to reveal its true nature in the coming weeks as it approaches perihelion, its closest point to the Sun, according to Harvard scientist Avi Loeb. The object may break apart, a common occurrence for comets, or it may release tiny probes that could potentially self-replicate.</p>

<p>This development is significant as it raises questions about the origins of 3I/Atlas and its potential for exploration within our solar system. As the object nears the Sun, scientists are closely monitoring its behavior to determine whether it is a natural comet or an artificial construct.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/Atlas was discovered on July 1.</li>
    <li>Perihelion is expected to occur shortly after October 29.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb has suggested that the object may release mini probes.</li>
    <li>Probes could potentially self-replicate for exploration purposes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas was discovered on July 1. As it approaches its perihelion, scientists are preparing for potential changes in its structure and behavior. The key date for further observations is October 29, when more information about the object may become available.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "If 3I/ATLAS is a comet of natural origin, it could disintegrate into fragments as it comes closer to the Sun," said Avi Loeb in his blog.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "We should keep our eyes on this fuzzy ball of light and check whether it breaks up into independent, smaller dots of light," Loeb added.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comets have historically been known to break apart as they approach the Sun due to outgassing and gravitational forces. The behavior of 3I/Atlas could provide insights into the nature of interstellar objects and their potential origins, especially given the ongoing debate about whether it is a natural or artificial construct.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/Atlas closely as it nears perihelion. Observations after October 29 will be critical in determining its nature and potential for releasing probes.</p>
