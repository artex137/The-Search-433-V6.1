      <h2>'Set of jets' surrounding 3I/ATLAS could be used 'for navigation of a spacecraft' — as second interstellar object is spotted in the sky</h2>

<p>New images of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, captured on November 8, reveal a complex jet structure that has sparked speculation about its nature. The images show at least seven distinct jets, which Harvard astrophysicist Dr. Avi Loeb suggests may indicate the object is an artificial craft. There are currently no reports of injuries or fatalities associated with this discovery.</p>

<p>This finding is significant as it raises questions about the potential for extraterrestrial technology. Dr. Loeb has stated that the jets could be linked to thrusters used for spacecraft navigation, but he also acknowledged the possibility that they are a result of natural processes involving ice on the object's surface. NASA has recorded 3I/ATLAS's behavior, and the object is expected to be closest to Earth on December 19.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Discovery Date: July 2025</li>
    <li>Closest Approach to Earth: December 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Number of Jets Observed: At least seven</li>
    <li>Distance Between 3I/ATLAS and C/2025 V1: Closest separation is 75 million kilometers (0.5 au)</li>
    <li>Non-gravitational acceleration recorded by NASA: Yes</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025. On November 8, new images captured the object, revealing a complex jet structure. Dr. Loeb published his analysis shortly thereafter, suggesting the jets could indicate artificial propulsion. As of now, the object is on a trajectory that will bring it closest to Earth on December 19.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It would be easy to test whether 3I/ATLAS is natural or technological by measuring the outflow velocity, mass flux and composition of its jets during the coming month,” Dr. Loeb wrote in a follow-up piece.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“C/2025 V1 is not related to 3I/ATLAS if it did not employ non-gravitational propulsion,” Dr. Loeb explained regarding the second interstellar object.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Since its discovery, 3I/ATLAS has generated considerable interest due to its anomalous behaviors, which have led some to theorize that it could be an extraterrestrial probe. The object glows “bluer than the sun,” which has been described as a potential technological signature.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to conduct further measurements of 3I/ATLAS’s jets in the coming weeks to determine their composition and behavior as the object approaches Earth.</p>
