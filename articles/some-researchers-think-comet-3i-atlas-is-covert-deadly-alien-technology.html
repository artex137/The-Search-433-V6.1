      <h2>Researchers Claim Comet 3I/ATLAS Might Be Alien Technology</h2>

<p>A group of researchers has suggested that comet 3I/ATLAS, currently approaching Earth, may be covert technology from an aggressive alien civilization. The claims come from a small team led by Avi Loeb, an astronomer at Harvard University known for linking celestial objects to alien intelligence. This assertion has sparked debate within the scientific community.</p>

<p>The significance of these claims lies in the ongoing discussions about extraterrestrial life and the nature of interstellar objects. While the majority of astronomers assert that 3I/ATLAS is a comet, Loeb and his colleagues argue that its unusual trajectory may indicate engineered origins. The scientific community remains divided on the topic, with some concerned that such claims could undermine legitimate research.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>3I/ATLAS is currently approaching Earth.</li>
<li>Avi Loeb leads a group of researchers proposing it may be alien technology.</li>
<li>Loeb previously claimed that the object Oumuamua was an alien probe.</li>
<li>Darryl Seligman states that 3I/ATLAS shows classic cometary activity.</li>
<li>The object’s trajectory differs from other interstellar objects.</li>
<li>Loeb has rated the likelihood of 3I/ATLAS being artificial a six out of ten on his 'Loeb Scale.'</li>
<li>Scientists expect evidence of cometary chemicals to emerge in the coming weeks.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered recently, prompting immediate interest from astronomers. Initial observations indicated it might behave similarly to known comets. However, Loeb's group has raised questions about its trajectory and lack of gas emissions. While Seligman and others have confirmed cometary characteristics, Loeb argues that evidence remains insufficient.</p>
<p>As research continues, astronomers anticipate that more definitive signs of 3I/ATLAS's nature will become visible as it gets closer to the Sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“There have been numerous telescopic observations of 3I/ATLAS demonstrating that it’s displaying classical signatures of cometary activity,” said Darryl Seligman, who led the first study on the object.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“We are worried about existential threats from artificial intelligence, from global climate change, from an asteroid impact, but we never discuss alien technology,” Loeb stated in a recent interview.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is not the first time Loeb has suggested that celestial phenomena could be linked to extraterrestrial life. His previous claims regarding Oumuamua, which was later identified as an asteroid, have drawn both interest and skepticism. The current discussion surrounding 3I/ATLAS reflects ongoing debates in the scientific community about the nature of interstellar objects and the search for extraterrestrial intelligence.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Research on 3I/ATLAS will continue as astronomers monitor the object’s path and chemical signatures. Scientists expect that as 3I/ATLAS approaches the Sun, more evidence will clarify its classification as either a comet or something else.</p>
