      <h2>NASA to Unveil New Images of Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS on November 19</h2>
<p>NASA will reveal new imagery of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS during a press conference on Wednesday, November 19, at 3 p.m. ET (2000 GMT). The event will be streamed live, allowing viewers to witness the latest findings about the comet.</p>

<p>This announcement is significant as the new images may showcase increased cometary activity following its recent passage near the sun. The images have been collected by various NASA missions, according to a statement from the agency.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date and Time:</strong> November 19, 2023, at 3 p.m. ET (2000 GMT)</li>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2023, by the ATLAS (Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System) observatory, which is funded by NASA. The comet made its closest approach to Mars on October 3, 2023, passing within about 19 million miles (30 million kilometers) of the planet. On October 29, it reached perihelion, coming within approximately 130 million miles (210 million kilometers) of the sun.</p>

<p>The upcoming press conference on November 19 will present the new imagery collected from various NASA missions and discuss the comet's behavior during its solar passage.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Assets within NASA's science missions give the United States the unique capability to observe 3I/ATLAS almost the entire time it passes through our celestial neighborhood, and study — with complementary scientific instruments and from different directions — how the comet behaves,” NASA officials said in a statement.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar comet discovered in our solar system, following 1I/'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Its observation is crucial for understanding the behavior of interstellar objects and their potential impact on Earth.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA plans to continue monitoring 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth on December 19, 2023. The findings from the upcoming press conference may provide insights into the comet's activity and characteristics.</p>
