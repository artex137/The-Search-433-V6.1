      <h2>Strange Orange Orbs Seen Speeding Over Missouri Night Sky</h2>

<p>A Missouri man has reported seeing multiple orange orbs moving rapidly in the night sky near Stockton, Missouri, at around 10:15 PM on October 20, 2025. The man described the orbs as traveling at speeds exceeding 250 km/h, with no injuries or fatalities reported.</p>

<p>This sighting adds to a growing number of unidentified flying object (UFO) reports in the region. Authorities are currently reviewing the report submitted to the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) for further investigation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Incident occurred at approximately 10:15 PM on October 20, 2025.</li>
    <li>Location: Stockton, Missouri, approximately 1.5 hours south of Whiteman Air Force Base.</li>
    <li>The witness estimated he was within half a mile of the orbs.</li>
    <li>The orbs were reported to have appeared and vanished multiple times over 20 minutes.</li>
    <li>Seven orbs were observed near the end of the sighting, with three in a triangle formation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>At 10:15 PM, the witness, while overlooking a field, began to see multiple orange orbs in the sky. The orbs exhibited bright flashes, fading in and out over a span of about 20 minutes. The witness noted that sometimes one orb appeared, while at other times, multiple orbs danced around each other in what he described as unnatural patterns.</p>

<p>Near the end of the sighting, the witness observed seven orbs, with three forming a triangle and the others moving around them. The orbs subsequently disappeared one by one.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“While overlooking a large field with trees far off in the distance, multiple orange orbs appeared in the sky above the tree line. They faded in, got very bright, and then would vanish in thin air like they faded out,” the witness reported to NUFORC.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Sometimes it was one at a time; sometimes it was multiple orbs at the same time that would dance around each other in unnatural patterns,” he added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This sighting contributes to a series of recent UFO reports in Missouri. The state's proximity to military installations, including Whiteman Air Force Base, has led to speculation about the nature of these sightings. However, the witness's description does not align with known aircraft or military operations.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities will continue to investigate the sighting and assess any potential links to other reported incidents in the area. Further updates will be provided as more information becomes available.</p>
