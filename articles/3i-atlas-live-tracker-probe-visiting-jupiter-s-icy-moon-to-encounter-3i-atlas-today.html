      <h2>3I/ATLAS Live Tracker: Probe visiting Jupiter's icy moon to encounter 3I/ATLAS today</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is becoming visible again after its solar conjunction and perihelion in October, with the Lowell Observatory in Arizona reporting its emergence from behind the Sun. The comet is expected to reveal more of its characteristics in the coming weeks as scientists monitor its behaviour.</p>

<p>This event is significant as scientists have observed unexpected changes in 3I/ATLAS, including a shift in colour and brightness. Avi Loeb, a scientist from Harvard University, has flagged these anomalies and has urged NASA to disclose its observations from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter made on October 2-3. The agency has not provided information since the government shutdown on October 1.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is currently 64 million kilometres from the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE).</li>
    <li>The comet reached perihelion at the end of October.</li>
    <li>It is expected to become visible to standard amateur telescopes across a major region of the Northern Hemisphere.</li>
    <li>NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter captured images of 3I/ATLAS, but details remain undisclosed.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb has called the data from NASA "time sensitive" with a spatial resolution of 30 kilometres per pixel.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS underwent perihelion in late October, where it displayed unexpected changes, including a blue hue and signs of non-gravitational acceleration. This event has prompted researchers to observe the comet closely as it moves away from the Sun.</p>

<p>On October 2-3, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter gathered data on 3I/ATLAS, but subsequent information has not been released due to the government shutdown that began on October 1.</p>

<p>As of November 4, the comet will be positioned for further observation by the JUICE mission, which is studying Jupiter’s icy moons: Ganymede, Callisto, and Europa.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "The precious data is time sensitive and would help to guide upcoming observations of 3I/ATLAS before the object leaves our solar system."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is an interstellar comet that has garnered attention due to its unusual characteristics. The government shutdown has delayed the release of critical data from NASA, impacting the ability of scientists to study the comet further.</p>

<p>Recent observations have indicated that 3I/ATLAS has undergone notable changes, raising questions about its composition and behaviour as it travels through the solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists are awaiting further data from NASA regarding 3I/ATLAS, particularly from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Observations will continue as the comet becomes more visible in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
