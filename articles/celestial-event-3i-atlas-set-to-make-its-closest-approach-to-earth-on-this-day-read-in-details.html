      <h2>Celestial Event 3I/ATLAS Set to Make Its Closest Approach to Earth on December 19</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, also known as C/2025 N1, is expected to make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025. Discovered on July 1, 2025, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS), the comet is displaying increased activity as it nears our planet.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it offers scientists a unique opportunity to study an interstellar comet and compare its characteristics with those of Solar System comets. Authorities, including NASA and the European Space Agency, are closely monitoring the comet's trajectory and behavior using advanced telescopes.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1)</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach Date:</strong> December 19, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance at Closest Approach:</strong> Approximately 280 million kilometers</li>
    <li><strong>Notable Observations:</strong> Bright central nucleus, distinct tail, and anti-tail</li>
    <li><strong>Agencies Involved:</strong> NASA, European Space Agency (ESA)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered by the ATLAS station. The first images were taken by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope shortly after its discovery. On November 23, 2025, Hubble captured images showing a bright nucleus and a teardrop-shaped dust cocoon. In early November, ESA's JUICE mission provided close-up images of the comet, revealing its structural features.</p>
<p>On December 2, 2025, amateur astronomers in Namibia captured a stunning image of the comet, showcasing its visibility from Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The study of comet 3I/ATLAS offers scientists a rare opportunity to understand the processes that shape planetary systems,” a representative from NASA said. “By comparing its behaviour and composition with Solar System comets, we aim to determine whether interstellar comets share similar properties or carry distinctly different materials.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is one of the few interstellar comets observed to date. Such comets provide valuable insights into the materials and processes that exist beyond our Solar System. Previous studies of other interstellar objects have indicated notable differences in composition compared to Solar System comets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the comet approaches Earth, astronomers will continue to monitor its activity and gather data to enhance our understanding of interstellar objects. Observations will be critical in the lead-up to its closest approach on December 19, 2025.</p>
