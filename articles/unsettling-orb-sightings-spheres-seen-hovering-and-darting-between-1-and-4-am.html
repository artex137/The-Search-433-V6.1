      <h2>Unsettling orb sightings — Spheres seen hovering and darting between 1 and 4 am</h2>

<p>People have reported seeing metallic orbs hovering over military installations in the United States between 1 and 4 a.m. in the past two and a half years. Military personnel have also claimed to witness these unidentified flying objects (UFOs), which have appeared across New York, California, and Arizona. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities linked to these sightings.</p>

<p>The Pentagon is investigating these incidents as they have raised questions about national security and possible advanced technology. The All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) is tasked with finding explanations for these sightings, but many remain unresolved. Authorities have expressed concern about the implications of these sightings, especially as they occur near military sites.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Time of sightings: Between 1 and 4 a.m.</li>
    <li>Locations: New York, California, Arizona</li>
    <li>Number of sightings: 8,000 total, with 422 classified as metallic orbs</li>
    <li>Reported sightings near military bases: 360</li>
    <li>Unresolved cases: 21 from May 2023 to June 2024</li>
    <li>Agency involved: Pentagon's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In the past two and a half years, numerous sightings of metallic orbs have been reported across the United States. The majority of these sightings occurred in the early morning hours, specifically between 1 and 4 a.m. AARO has documented 757 UFO sightings from May 2023 to June 2024, with 21 cases still unresolved.</p>

<p>Many reports describe the orbs hovering silently before darting away at high speeds. Witnesses, including military personnel and civilians, have provided videos of these occurrences, contributing to the growing body of evidence.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“While we have dismissed many sightings as birds or planes, several remain unresolved,” said an AARO spokesperson.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Reports of UFO sightings have surged in recent years, with incidents not only in the U.S. but also across the globe. The Buga Sphere from Colombia has garnered attention, with researchers investigating its properties. Authorities speculate that some sightings could involve advanced drones or surveillance devices from other nations.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations by the AARO will continue as they seek to analyze the remaining unresolved sightings. The office is expected to release further reports detailing their findings and any potential implications for national security.</p>
