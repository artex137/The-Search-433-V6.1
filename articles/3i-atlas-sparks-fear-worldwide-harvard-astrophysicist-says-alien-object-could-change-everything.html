      <h2>3I/ATLAS Sparks Fear Worldwide: Harvard Astrophysicist Says 'Alien' Object Could 'Change Everything'</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist Dr. Avi Loeb has warned the public to enjoy their time before October 29, when the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS makes its closest approach to Earth. Loeb claims the object, which is larger than Manhattan, may be an alien spacecraft and suggests that NASA is not disclosing the full truth regarding this unusual visitor.</p>

<p>This matter has raised significant interest among the scientific community and the public alike. Authorities are currently analyzing data from telescopes and space agencies to better understand the properties and implications of 3I/ATLAS as it approaches our planet.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: October 29, 2023</li>
    <li>Size: Larger than Manhattan</li>
    <li>Emission: Four grams of nickel per second with no evidence of iron</li>
    <li>Observation location: Keck II telescope, Hawaii</li>
    <li>Distance from Mars during observation: 12 million miles</li>
    <li>NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter captured images of 3I/ATLAS</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has captured attention since its discovery, with Dr. Loeb first discussing its unusual properties in a recent media appearance. Observations from the Keck II telescope have revealed its unique emissions, which include a plume of nickel, a material not typically found in space. The object’s trajectory and size also defy astronomical expectations. As it approaches Earth, scientists continue to analyze its characteristics and implications.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This was a process that we can imagine only because it was used in industry,” Dr. Loeb stated, emphasizing the unprecedented behavior of the interstellar object.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“If it was designed by intelligence you wouldn't be able to forecast exactly what it would do,” he added, urging the scientific community to consider all possibilities.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The unusual characteristics of 3I/ATLAS have prompted comparisons to previous interstellar objects, which have not exhibited similar behaviors. Dr. Loeb's views challenge conventional understanding and have sparked a broader discussion about the nature of such objects in our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As October 29 approaches, scientists will continue to gather data on 3I/ATLAS. The release of crucial images from NASA remains pending due to a government shutdown. Dr. Loeb has expressed concern that this delay may hinder public understanding of the object’s true nature.</p>
