      <h2>WATCH: Triangular UFO Spotted Over Area 51 - Social Media Erupts with Alien Theories</h2>

<p>An unidentified flying object shaped like a triangular Dorito has been spotted over Area 51, a U.S. Air Force facility in Nevada, on January 14. The sighting has sparked widespread discussions and theories about extraterrestrial life across social media platforms.</p>

<p>The event matters because Area 51 has long been associated with conspiracy theories about UFOs and alien technology. The U.S. military has not confirmed the nature of the object, but the sighting has reignited public interest in the site, known for its secrecy and classified operations.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of sighting: January 14</li>
    <li>Location: Area 51, Nevada</li>
    <li>Videographer: Anders Otteson, YouTube channel Uncanny Expeditions</li>
    <li>Footage type: High-resolution thermal imaging</li>
    <li>Viral views: Approximately 500,000</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On the early morning of January 14, videographer Anders Otteson camped near Groom Lake Road, adjacent to Area 51. He set up thermal imaging equipment to monitor nocturnal flight activity. During this observation, Otteson recorded footage of a triangular aircraft that contrasted sharply against the night sky.</p>

<p>The footage quickly gained attention online, with viewers noting the object lacked conventional visual cues often associated with aircraft, such as navigation lights. It drew comparisons to a Dorito chip and prompted discussions regarding its origin and purpose.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The object stood out clearly in the thermal spectrum and got immediate attention due to its pronounced geometric shape,” Otteson said.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Area 51 has been a focal point for UFO culture since the mid-twentieth century. The facility is officially part of the Nevada Test and Training Range and is known for testing experimental aircraft. The secrecy surrounding its operations has led to widespread speculation about the presence of alien technology.</p>

<p>Earlier incidents of triangular craft sightings in the U.S., such as those reported over Wichita, Kansas, in 2014, have further fueled public interest in the topic. The recent sighting has been linked to these past reports, although no official confirmation exists regarding the nature of the object.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>There are currently no official investigations announced regarding the sighting. The U.S. military has not commented on the object, leaving its status and origin uncertain.</p>
