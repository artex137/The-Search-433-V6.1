      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/Atlas crosses the solar system at 57 km/s and confirms extragalactic origin</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/Atlas, identified as the third object of its type, is crossing the inner solar system at an average speed of 57 km/s as of November 2025. The comet's hyperbolic trajectory indicates it will not be captured by the Sun's gravity and will exit the solar system in a few weeks. Astronomers from various ground-based and space observatories are monitoring the comet in real time.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it confirms the extragalactic origin of 3I/Atlas, which has a distinct chemical composition compared to comets formed in the solar system. Authorities are conducting extensive observations to gather data on the comet's behavior and characteristics, as this information could enhance the understanding of ejection processes in distant planetary systems.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet speed: 57 km/s</li>
    <li>Identification: 3I/Atlas, the third interstellar object confirmed</li>
    <li>Current location: Inner solar system</li>
    <li>Projected perihelion: December 2025</li>
    <li>Observatories involved: Catalina Sky Survey, Pan-STARRS, ESA, NASA</li>
    <li>Observation window: Limited to a few weeks</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas was discovered through automated surveys, with preliminary orbit data revealing its hyperbolic trajectory. The comet has been monitored since its identification, with real-time data being collected from various observatories. As it approaches the Sun, astronomers are refining predictions about its closest approach and gathering information on its chemical composition.</p>

<p>Models predict that the comet will experience additional acceleration due to the gravitational slingshot effect during its perihelion in December 2025. This process will contribute to its exit from the solar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The absence of an intense coma differentiates 3I/Atlas from Comet Borisov,” an astronomer from one of the monitoring teams noted.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“High-resolution images are being taken to look for signs of activity as the object approaches the Sun,” said a representative from NASA.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas marks the third confirmation of interstellar visitors in less than a decade, following the discovery of ‘Oumuamua in 2017 and Comet Borisov in 2019. Each of these objects has provided unique insights into the characteristics and origins of interstellar bodies.</p>

<p>The significant differences in speed and chemical composition between these comets highlight the diverse nature of interstellar materials and their formation processes in different stellar systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Observations of 3I/Atlas will continue until the comet moves beyond optical range. International teams are coordinating efforts to maximize data collection during this limited observation window, aiming to enhance the understanding of interstellar objects and their origins.</p>
