      <h2>Avi Loeb Invites Kim Kardashian to Join 3I/ATLAS Research Team</h2>

<p>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has invited reality TV star Kim Kardashian to join his research team studying the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, as detailed in a Medium article published in November 2025. This invitation highlights the intersection of scientific inquiry and celebrity culture, drawing attention to the peculiarities of 3I/ATLAS, which was first detected in early 2025.</p>

<p>The study of 3I/ATLAS matters because it raises questions about the origins of the object and its unique characteristics. Loeb's research, conducted through the Galileo Project at Harvard, has focused on the object's unusual trajectory and composition, which could suggest non-natural origins. The scientific community continues to debate these theories, with ongoing observations planned as the object approaches Earth on December 19, 2025.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> Early 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to Earth:</strong> December 19, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Mass Comparison:</strong> Roughly one million times that of 'Oumuamua</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Exceeding typical comet speeds</li>
    <li><strong>Gas Plume Composition:</strong> 4% water, high nickel-to-iron ratio</li>
    <li><strong>Trajectory:</strong> Retrograde, with a 0.2% likelihood of occurrence</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected in early 2025 as it entered the solar system. In July and August of that year, it displayed a sunward jet, known as an "anti-tail." It reached perihelion, its closest point to the Sun, on October 30, 2025, where it exhibited rapid brightening and a striking blue colour. Loeb's invitation to Kardashian came in November 2025, coinciding with growing public interest and scientific scrutiny of the object.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The object's arrival was fine-tuned to pass within tens of millions of kilometers of Mars, Venus, and Jupiter, while being unobservable from Earth at perihelion,” said Loeb.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discussion around 3I/ATLAS is part of a broader conversation about transparency in scientific research. Recent controversies have emerged regarding data sharing, particularly in light of a letter from Congresswoman Luna, which demands disclosure of high-resolution images of the object. Critics have accused authorities of favoritism in their responses to public figures like Kardashian, contrasting this with the lack of information provided to researchers.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Earth, continued observations are planned using telescopes such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and ground-based instruments. The scientific community anticipates further data to clarify whether 3I/ATLAS is a natural comet or potentially something more significant.</p>
