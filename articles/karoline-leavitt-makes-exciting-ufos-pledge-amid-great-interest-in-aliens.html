      <h2>Karoline Leavitt makes 'exciting' UFOs pledge amid 'great interest' in aliens</h2>

<p>Karoline Leavitt, the White House Press Secretary, responded to a question about extraterrestrials during a briefing on Wednesday, generating significant online buzz. The inquiry came from Newsmax correspondent Mike Carter, who asked whether President Donald Trump believes in aliens. Leavitt's lighthearted response has prompted renewed interest in UFOs and government transparency regarding extraterrestrial matters.</p>

<p>This exchange highlights a growing public fascination with UFOs and government disclosures about alien life. The White House has indicated it will address these inquiries further, coinciding with a surge of interest following comments made by former President Barack Obama about the existence of aliens.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>

    <li>Event: White House briefing with Karoline Leavitt</li>
    <li>Date: Wednesday, February 15</li>
    <li>Location: White House, Washington, D.C.</li>
    <li>Inquirer: Mike Carter, Newsmax correspondent</li>
    <li>Response: "That sounds very exciting, though," Leavitt said.</li>
    <li>Related comments: Barack Obama on a podcast regarding aliens</li>
    <li>Trump's announcement: Directing relevant agencies to release government files on UFOs</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On February 15, during a White House briefing, Karoline Leavitt was asked by journalist Mike Carter if President Trump believes in aliens. Leavitt responded with enthusiasm, noting the public interest in the topic. The question was inspired by comments made by former President Obama on a podcast, where he stated, "They're real. But I haven't seen them." Following this, Obama clarified his remarks on social media, emphasizing the vastness of the universe and the low likelihood of alien visitation.</p>

<p>In a statement on Truth Social, Trump announced plans to direct the Secretary of War and other departments to release information related to UFOs and extraterrestrial life. This announcement received support from administration representatives and Republican legislators.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“That would be of great interest to me personally, and I'm sure all of you in this room, and apparently former President Obama too. So we'll keep you posted on that,” Leavitt said during the briefing.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Based on the tremendous interest shown, I will be directing the Secretary of War, and other relevant Departments and Agencies, to begin the process of identifying and releasing Government files related to alien and extraterrestrial life, unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), and unidentified flying objects (UFOs),” Trump wrote on Truth Social.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discussion around UFOs has intensified in recent years, particularly with the focus on Area 51, a top-secret testing site in Nevada. For decades, conspiracy theories have surrounded this location, claiming it houses evidence of UFO encounters. In 2013, the CIA acknowledged the site's existence but did not confirm any claims regarding alien technology. Congressional hearings throughout 2024 have also examined UFO encounters, further fueling public interest.</p>

<p>Obama's comments and Trump's subsequent announcement reflect a significant shift in government transparency regarding UFOs, with both former and current leaders acknowledging the public's curiosity.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Moving forward, the White House plans to provide updates on the release of government files related to UFOs and extraterrestrial life. This initiative aims to address the public's growing interest in these topics and foster transparency in government operations.</p>
