      <h2>Why is it called 3I/ATLAS? The origin of the comet is debated</h2>

<p>The comet 3I/ATLAS, detected on July 1, 2025, has sparked significant interest and debate regarding its origins. It is the third interstellar object identified by humanity, following 1I/Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. NASA has confirmed that the comet poses no threat to Earth.</p>

<p>This discovery matters as it contributes to our understanding of interstellar objects and the potential for extraterrestrial phenomena. NASA has emphasized that 3I/ATLAS will not come closer than approximately 1.8 astronomical units, or about 270 million kilometres, from Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date of discovery:</strong> July 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Location of telescope:</strong> Rio Hurtado, Chile</li>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to Earth:</strong> 1.8 astronomical units (about 270 million kilometres)</li>
    <li><strong>Previous interstellar objects:</strong> 1I/Oumuamua (2017), 2I/Borisov (2019)</li>
    <li><strong>Telescope system:</strong> Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>NASA reported the discovery of 3I/ATLAS on July 1, 2025. The ATLAS telescope system, which is responsible for the detection, is funded by NASA and based in Rio Hurtado, Chile. Following the discovery, observations of the comet have increased as scientists seek to learn more about its characteristics and origins.</p>

<p>As discussions have progressed, various experts have speculated about the comet's potential extraterrestrial and artificial origins. However, NASA has reiterated its classification of the object as a comet, supported by recent observations from the MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Comets are usually named after the person or team that discovers them, in this case the ATLAS survey team,” NASA stated on its website.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“It will stay away from our planet. The closest it will approach is around 1.8 astronomical units (about 270 million kilometers),” NASA reported.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of interstellar objects has gained momentum over the past decade, with 1I/Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov preceding 3I/ATLAS. These findings have opened new avenues for research into the nature of comets and their origins outside our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Ongoing observations and studies of 3I/ATLAS will continue as scientists aim to deepen their understanding of its composition and behavior, while NASA maintains its position that the comet does not pose any danger to Earth.</p>
