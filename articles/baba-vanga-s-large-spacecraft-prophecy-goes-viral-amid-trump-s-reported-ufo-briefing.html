      <h2>Baba Vanga's 'large spacecraft' prophecy goes viral amid Trump's reported UFO briefing</h2>

<p>Baba Vanga, a blind Bulgarian mystic, has predicted that humans will make official contact with extraterrestrial beings in 2026. This prediction has gained traction following reports that former U.S. President Donald Trump has been briefed about the reality of UFOs. The prophecy has circulated widely among her followers and on social media.</p>

<p>This prediction is significant as it coincides with ongoing discussions about UFOs in the U.S. government. Authorities have indicated they will declassify previously classified UFO files before the end of the year, raising public interest in the possibility of extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Baba Vanga predicted contact with aliens in 2026.</li>
    <li>Her prophecies are documented by her niece, Krasimira Stoyanova, and followers.</li>
    <li>Trump has reportedly been briefed about UFOs being real.</li>
    <li>Polymarket has reported a 12% chance of alien existence being officially acknowledged in 2025.</li>
    <li>More than $233,000 has been invested in the prediction market regarding UFO disclosures.</li>
    <li>Baba Vanga also predicted a global war, natural disasters, and the rise of Vladimir Putin in 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Baba Vanga, who lost her eyesight at the age of 12, began making predictions that her followers claim have come true. Her prophecy regarding a "large spacecraft" arriving on Earth in November 2026 has resurfaced recently. This follows an earlier prediction that aliens would contact Earth during a major sporting event in November 2025.</p>

<p>In July 2025, discussions intensified around the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which some speculated could be linked to alien life. However, NASA and other astronomers dismissed these claims, confirming that it was a comet.</p>

<p>On December 7, 2025, odds on Polymarket for the official acknowledgment of alien existence rose sharply from single digits to the mid-70s, peaking at 81%. The market will resolve only if classified documents relating to UFOs are released.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Experts have cautioned that her predictions have no proof and should be taken with a pinch of salt,” said a spokesperson from a leading scientific organization.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The interest in Baba Vanga's predictions has increased amid a broader cultural conversation about UFOs and extraterrestrial life. The year 2025 saw heightened discussions following the discovery of 3I/ATLAS, which some believed could harbor alien technology. However, these claims have largely been dismissed by the scientific community.</p>

<p>Baba Vanga's followers believe her visions extend beyond alien encounters, predicting significant global events in 2026, including natural disasters and geopolitical changes.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As authorities prepare to declassify UFO-related documents, public interest in both Baba Vanga's predictions and the reality of extraterrestrial life is expected to grow. Investigations into UFO sightings and reports will continue as the deadline for disclosures approaches.</p>
