      <h2>They built a structure around it, researcher claims of alleged UFO site</h2>

<p>A U.S. lawmaker has reported hearing classified briefings about an object of extraordinary size recovered outside the United States, intensifying demands in Washington for transparency regarding unexplained aerial phenomena. This claim emerged during a House oversight hearing on October 24, 2023, where unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) were again at the forefront of a contentious discussion between Congress and the Pentagon.</p>

<p>The hearing has prompted lawmakers to demand broader access to government files related to UAP investigations. The Pentagon’s All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) has processed over 750 reports from mid-2023 to mid-2024, most of which were attributed to balloons, drones, or sensor anomalies, according to the Department of Defense.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of hearing: October 24, 2023</li>
    <li>Location: U.S. Congress</li>
    <li>Number of reports processed by AARO: Over 750</li>
    <li>Year AARO was established: 2022</li>
    <li>Reported incidents involving U.S. military: At least one incident cited by Rep. Eric Burlison</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 24, 2023, the House oversight task force convened for over two hours to discuss UAP. Lawmakers filtered in and out of the session, which was attended by aides. No new physical evidence was presented during the hearing, and no public classified briefing followed. Several lawmakers suggested that additional closed-door sessions may be necessary to address the issue further.</p>

<p>During the hearing, Rep. Eric Burlison showcased footage of a U.S. MQ-9 Reaper engaging a fast-moving orb off the coast of Yemen in October 2024, which he argued should be reviewed by Congress. Air Force veteran Dylan Borland testified about a 2012 incident at Langley Air Force Base, claiming his career suffered due to retaliation after reporting his experience.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I’m not going to speculate what it is. But the question is, why are we being blocked from this information?” – Rep. Eric Burlison</blockquote>
<blockquote>“This craft interfered with my telephone, did not have any sound and the material it was made of appeared fluid or dynamic.” – Dylan Borland</blockquote>
<blockquote>“We need to ensure that people who come forward and make reports can do so without fear of retaliation.” – Rep. Jasmine Crockett</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The subject of UAP has gained renewed attention following public hearings in 2022 and 2023, which reopened discussions previously confined to classified settings. Congress has passed provisions aimed at strengthening whistleblower protections for individuals reporting UAP incidents, although concerns remain regarding the effectiveness of these protections.</p>

<p>Despite extraordinary claims being made, U.S. defense agencies have repeatedly denied concealing any confirmed alien craft. Researcher Dr. Steven Greer claimed that a large object was located in the mountains outside Seoul, South Korea, and that it was so large that a structure had to be built around it. However, scientific bodies have not validated these claims.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Congress is expected to continue discussions around access to information related to UAP investigations. Lawmakers may pursue further closed-door sessions to address the ongoing concerns about transparency and oversight in these matters.</p>
