      <h2>Images Show Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS Is Now Growing a Tail</h2>

<p>New images of comet 3I/ATLAS reveal the interstellar object's developing tail, captured by the Gemini South telescope operated by NOIRLab. The observation comes as the comet approaches its closest point to the Sun, known as perihelion, which is expected around 29 October 2025. There are no reports of injuries or fatalities.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant for astronomers studying the unique characteristics of 3I/ATLAS. The growing tail indicates a change in the comet's particles and provides insights into its chemical composition. According to astronomer Karen Meech from the University of Hawai'i, the observations aimed to analyze the colors and spectra of the comet, which can reveal details about its dust particles and chemistry.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is approaching perihelion on 29 October 2025.</li>
    <li>The latest images were captured by NOIRLab's Gemini South telescope.</li>
    <li>The observations focused on the comet's colors and chemical composition.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS has an unusually high concentration of carbon dioxide ice.</li>
    <li>The comet's coma became active beyond the orbit of Jupiter.</li>
    <li>Earth's closest encounter with 3I/ATLAS will occur after perihelion.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been under observation since its discovery. Recent images show the development of its tail as it approaches the Sun. The observations conducted by NOIRLab's Gemini South telescope are part of ongoing efforts to understand this interstellar visitor.</p>

<p>The comet's perihelion is set for 29 October 2025, when it will come within the orbit of Mars but will not cross Earth's path.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "The primary objectives of the observations were to look at the colors of the comet, which provide clues to the composition and sizes of the dust particles in the coma, and to take spectra for a direct measure of the chemistry," says Karen Meech, University of Hawai'i.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "As 3I/ATLAS speeds back into the depths of interstellar space, this image is both a scientific milestone and a source of wonder," adds Meech.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is distinct from previous interstellar objects, 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, and exhibits unique properties not typically seen in comets from our Solar System. Its activity beyond Jupiter's orbit and its high carbon dioxide concentration set it apart from other known comets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The analysis of the comet's tail and its chemical composition is still pending. Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches perihelion and prepare for further observations after its closest encounter with the Sun.</p>
