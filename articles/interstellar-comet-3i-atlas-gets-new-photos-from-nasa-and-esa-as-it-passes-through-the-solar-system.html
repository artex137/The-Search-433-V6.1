      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS gets new photos from NASA and ESA as it passes through the Solar System</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, confirmed as the third interstellar object to visit the Solar System, was detected on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS system telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile. The comet was about 676 million kilometers from the Sun and moving at 220,000 kilometers per hour at the time of its discovery.</p>

<p>This observation has prompted astronomers from NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) to conduct extensive studies of the comet's hyperbolic orbit, which indicates origins outside our star system. The comet is expected to reach its closest point to the Sun on October 31, 2025, followed by a safe passage of approximately 274 million kilometers from Earth on December 19, 2025.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Detected on July 1, 2025, at 676 million kilometers from the Sun.</li>
    <li>Initial speed of 220,000 kilometers per hour.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun on October 31, 2025.</li>
    <li>Projected passage near Earth on December 19, 2025, at 274 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>Initial coma size measured at 13,000 kilometers in June, expanding to 18,000 kilometers by July.</li>
    <li>Confirmed presence of water ice, carbon dioxide, methanol, and hydrogen cyanide in the coma.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, Comet 3I/ATLAS was first detected, prompting immediate observations. By July 2, ground-based telescopes, including the Telescópio Óptico Nórdico, confirmed cometary activity with a diffuse appearance and a reddish coma. In August, NASA's SPHEREx observatory examined the comet, revealing an abundance of water ice and carbon dioxide. By late September, several NASA probes, including the Lucy probe and the PUNCH satellites, recorded images of the comet, despite some delays due to government shutdowns.</p>

<p>On November 30, 2025, the Hubble Space Telescope revisited the comet, confirming its orbital movement. ESA's Juice spacecraft also provided images in November, showing the coma halo and suggesting two distinct tails. The comet is expected to remain visible with small telescopes until spring 2026, with its opposition occurring on January 22, 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The observations have improved our understanding of the comet's trajectory and composition significantly,” said a NASA spokesperson. 
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This detection of Comet 3I/ATLAS follows the discovery of other interstellar objects, highlighting ongoing research into the formation of comets and their origins. The comet's chemical composition suggests similarities to native Solar System comets, indicating shared processes in galaxy formation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and ESA will continue monitoring Comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth. Data collection will remain a priority, and astronomers encourage amateur contributions to refine models without risk of terrestrial impact.</p>
