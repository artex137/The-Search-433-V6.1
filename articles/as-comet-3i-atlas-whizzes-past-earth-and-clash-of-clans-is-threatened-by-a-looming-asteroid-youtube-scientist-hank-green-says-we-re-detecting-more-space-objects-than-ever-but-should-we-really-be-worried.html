      <h2>As Comet 3I/ATLAS Whizzes Past Earth, YouTube Scientist Hank Green Discusses Space Object Detection</h2>

<p>NASA has reported ongoing interest in Comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth this week. The comet is the third interstellar object ever detected and has sparked discussions about the increasing detection of space objects. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to the comet's passage.</p>

<p>This year, the scientific community has focused on improving detection methods for space objects. Authorities, including NASA, have developed advanced systems to track potential threats, reflecting a growing awareness of the need for vigilance in monitoring the solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is currently passing close to Earth.</li>
    <li>NASA lost asteroid 2007 FT3, which remains untracked since its discovery 18 years ago.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar object detected since 2017.</li>
    <li>Hank Green has collaborated with Supercell for an in-game event in Clash of Clans involving the asteroid 2007 FT3.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>2007: NASA tracks asteroid 2007 FT3 for approximately 24 hours before it disappears from view.</p>
<p>2017: The first interstellar object is detected, followed by two more, including 3I/ATLAS.</p>
<p>2023: Hank Green collaborates with Supercell to create an event in Clash of Clans centered around the 2007 FT3 asteroid.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The first thing is we're way better at spotting them than we've ever been,” said Hank Green regarding advancements in detection technology.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“We’ve started to do that work,” Green said about efforts to change the trajectory of dangerous asteroids. “We’ve sent probes to smash into asteroids to change their trajectory very slightly.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>NASA has lost track of asteroids in the past, but typically they are rediscovered within a few decades. The detection of 3I/ATLAS demonstrates improvements in tracking methods over the years. The development of the Vera Rubin Observatory in Chile promises to enhance our ability to identify interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and other organizations continue to refine detection systems for space objects. Ongoing efforts aim to prepare for potential threats and improve response strategies should a dangerous object be identified in the future.</p>
