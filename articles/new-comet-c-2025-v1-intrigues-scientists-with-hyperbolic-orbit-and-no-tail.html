      <h2>New comet C/2025 V1 intrigues scientists with hyperbolic orbit and no tail</h2>

<p>Amateur astronomer Gennady Borisov discovered comet C/2025 V1 on November 2, 2025, at the MARGO Observatory in Crimea. The object, confirmed by international teams shortly after its discovery, may be the fourth known interstellar object. Its hyperbolic orbit suggests it originates outside the Solar System, but the absence of a visible tail has raised questions among astronomers.</p>

<p>This discovery matters because it contributes to the understanding of interstellar objects and their origins. Authorities, including NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA), are actively monitoring the comet to analyze its characteristics and chemical composition.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered: November 2, 2025, at MARGO Observatory, Crimea</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth: 103 million kilometers on November 11, 2025</li>
    <li>Perihelion (closest point to the Sun): November 16, 2025, at 68 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Estimated core diameter: Between 1.4 km and 16 km</li>
    <li>Apparent magnitude at discovery: 14.2, visible only with telescopes</li>
    <li>Speed relative to the Sun: 210 km/h</li>
    <li>Monitoring by: NASA, ESA, and telescopes in Chile, Austria, and Japan</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On November 2, 2025, Gennady Borisov discovered comet C/2025 V1 during routine observations. The object was confirmed by international teams within hours. It passed 103 million kilometers from Earth on November 11, 2025, and is set to reach perihelion on November 16, 2025.</p>
<p>Intensive monitoring by terrestrial and space telescopes began on November 3, 2025. Scientists have since analyzed the comet’s chemical composition and characteristics, noting its diffuse coma but absence of a tail.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The absence of a tail is attributed to low initial sublimation, despite the proximity to the Sun,” said a spokesperson from the NASA monitoring team.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of C/2025 V1 follows patterns observed in other interstellar comets, such as 1I/Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. However, its lack of a tail differentiates it from these predecessors. The mass loss of C/2025 V1, estimated at 0.4% before perihelion, is lower than that of other known comets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Post-perihelion observations are planned using the Hubble and James Webb Telescopes. Researchers will look for radio emissions and brightness variations to determine whether C/2025 V1 is truly interstellar or originates from the Oort Cloud, aiding studies on the formation of stellar systems.</p>
