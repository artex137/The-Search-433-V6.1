      <p class="byline">Published 2025-12-23 20:35 UTC</p>

      <h2>3I/ATLAS approach to Jupiter in 2026 demonstrates accurate trajectory</h2>

<p>An interstellar object, 3I/ATLAS, has approached Jupiter and is expected to make a close encounter on March 16, 2026, at a distance of approximately 53.445 million kilometers. The object, discovered in 2025, has generated significant interest in the scientific community due to its unusual characteristics compared to typical comets and asteroids.</p>

<p>This event matters because the precise trajectory of 3I/ATLAS challenges current understanding of interstellar objects and their origins. Researchers are closely monitoring its approach to gather more data, which could lead to new insights about its chemical composition and dynamic behavior.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Discovery: 2025</li>
    <li>Encounter with Jupiter: March 16, 2026</li>
    <li>Predicted distance to perijove: 53.445 million km</li>
    <li>Radius of Hill of Jupiter: 53.502 million km</li>
    <li>Margin of error: ±0.06 million km</li>
    <li>Speed: 60 km/s</li>
    <li>Monitoring agencies: Various observatories worldwide</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was identified in 2025 and has since been the focus of intense observation. Calculations indicate that its trajectory has been adjusted with remarkable precision, allowing for an encounter with Jupiter while remaining invisible from Earth during its closest approach to the Sun, known as perihelion.</p>
<p>From July to November 2025, observations confirmed the presence of a jet directed towards the Sun, which is distinct from typical cometary behavior. Images captured by the HiRISE camera during its approach to Mars showed a luminous extension in front of the nucleus.</p>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Jupiter, it will pass through the region of the points of Lagrange L1 and L2, which are of interest for future observations due to their energy efficiency for stable orbits.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The precision of the trajectory adjustment indicates a remarkable control over the object's path,” said a researcher involved in the monitoring of 3I/ATLAS.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The unique chemical composition and behavior of 3I/ATLAS challenge our understanding of interstellar objects,” noted another scientist.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is significantly larger than previous interstellar objects, such as 1I/’Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, with a nuclear mass estimated to be up to a million times that of 1I/’Oumuamua. Its unusual characteristics, including a high nickel abundance relative to iron and an extreme negative polarization, set it apart from known comets.</p>
<p>The object’s origin coincides closely with the source of the Wow! signal detected in 1977, which adds to the intrigue surrounding its nature and classification.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Observatories worldwide will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Jupiter, with expectations for new images and spectral data to be collected in the coming months. This data will help further investigate its peculiarities and enhance understanding of its origins.</p>
