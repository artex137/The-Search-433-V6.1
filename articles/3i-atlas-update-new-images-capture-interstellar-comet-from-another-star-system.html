      <h2>3I/ATLAS Update: New Images Capture Interstellar Comet From Another Star System</h2>

<p>A major international effort has produced detailed images and chemical data on interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it leaves our solar system. Observations from the Hubble Space Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope have revealed the comet's nucleus is approximately 2.6 kilometres wide and contains unusual gases, including methane, carbon dioxide, and water.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it marks the first direct detection of methane in an object known to originate outside our solar system. Scientists say this provides rare insight into the chemistry of distant star systems. Observatories worldwide are now collaborating to monitor the comet's activity as it continues its outbound journey.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first spotted on 1 July 2025 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Chile.</li>
    <li>The comet reached speeds of approximately 68.3 km/s at its closest point to the Sun in October 2025.</li>
    <li>The nucleus of the comet has an effective diameter of about 2.6 kilometres.</li>
    <li>Observations have confirmed the presence of methane, carbon dioxide, and water in the comet's gas coma.</li>
    <li>The comet is expected to pass Jupiter in March 2026 on its final outward path.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected on 1 July 2025. By October 2025, the comet reached perihelion, moving at speeds of around 68.3 km/s. In late 2025 and January 2026, researchers noted robust methane outgassing, marking the first time methane has been detected in an interstellar object. Ongoing observations from various telescopes have provided a detailed profile of the comet as it continues its journey.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS provides a unique chance to study material formed in another star system,” said a lead researcher involved in the observations. “The chemical fingerprints of interstellar objects reflect the environments in which they were born.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third recognized interstellar object to visit our solar system, following the cigar-shaped 'Oumuamua and Comet Borisov. Unlike these predecessors, 3I/ATLAS has exhibited a vibrant and active behaviour, allowing for extensive study and analysis by a global consortium of observatories.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Observatories will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it fades from view. Data collected during its passage is expected to contribute to a deeper understanding of the chemical composition of distant star systems.</p>
