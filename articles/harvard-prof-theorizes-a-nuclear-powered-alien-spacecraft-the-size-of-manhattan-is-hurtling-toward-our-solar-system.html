      <h2>Harvard Prof theorizes a nuclear-powered alien spacecraft the size of Manhattan is hurtling toward our solar system</h2>

<p>Scientists have identified a peculiar object, 3I/ATLAS, moving towards our solar system, which is theorized by Harvard professor Avi Loeb to be a sign of extraterrestrial technology. 3I/ATLAS, which is approximately the size of Manhattan, is expected to make its closest approach to Mars in October 2023. There are no reported injuries or fatalities associated with the object's trajectory.</p>

<p>This discovery has drawn significant attention from the scientific community. Authorities are currently monitoring 3I/ATLAS closely, as it could provide insights into the existence of advanced extraterrestrial civilizations. Loeb, who is the founding director of Harvard’s Black Hole Initiative, has raised concerns regarding the object's unusual characteristics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Object Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Size:</strong> Approximately the size of Manhattan</li>
    <li><strong>Closest Approach to Mars:</strong> October 2023</li>
    <li><strong>Flight Path Characteristics:</strong> In-line with the orbit of planets</li>
    <li><strong>Likelihood of Coincidence:</strong> 0.2 percent</li>
    <li><strong>Current Monitoring:</strong> Ongoing by global astronomers</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In June 2023, scientists first spotted 3I/ATLAS as it entered the solar system. The object has since been under observation due to its unusual lack of a tail, which is characteristic of comets. Professor Loeb has suggested that its size and flight path warrant further investigation.</p>
<p>October 2023 marks the projected closest approach of 3I/ATLAS to Mars, where NASA's telescopes are expected to capture clearer images of the object.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The likelihood for that coincidence out of all random orientations is 0.2 percent,” said Professor Avi Loeb regarding 3I/ATLAS's flight path.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“There have been no signs pointing to non-natural origins of 3I/ATLAS in the available observations,” stated Richard Moissl, Head of Planetary Defence at the European Space Agency.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The consequences, should the hypothesis turn out to be correct, could potentially be dire for humanity,” Loeb urged regarding the need for further study of 3I/ATLAS.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is not the first time Professor Loeb has proposed that an interstellar object may have artificial origins. In 2017, he suggested that Oumuamua, another interstellar visitor, could have been built by an alien civilization. However, definitive proof was never captured, and Oumuamua has since departed the solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Mars, astronomers worldwide will continue to collect data on its orbit and physical properties. The scientific community remains committed to studying the object as it passes through the solar system.
