      <h2>NASA steps up planetary defense after detecting mysterious radio signals from comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>The global astronomical community is on alert after the detection of unusual radio emissions from comet 3I/ATLAS, which was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS astronomical survey system. The comet, the third interstellar object identified crossing our solar system, is currently being closely monitored by NASA’s Escritório of Coordenação of Defesa Planetária as it approaches Earth.</p>

<p>This detection has prompted significant interest from scientists and space agencies. NASA and the Agência Espacial Europeia (ESA) have initiated a global observation campaign to analyze the comet’s trajectory and composition. The aim is to gather as much data as possible during its passage, offering a unique opportunity to study material from another star system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>It has a hyperbolic trajectory, indicating it is not bound to our solar system.</li>
    <li>Its closest approach to Earth is expected on December 19, 2025, at a distance of approximately 27 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>Radio emissions were detected at a frequency of 1.6 GHz on October 24, 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet is estimated to have a diameter between 320 meters and 5.6 kilometers.</li>
    <li>NASA and ESA are leading efforts to coordinate observations with ground and space telescopes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the ATLAS astronomical survey system discovered comet 3I/ATLAS. Following this, NASA’s Escritório of Coordenação of Defesa Planetária began monitoring the comet’s trajectory and composition.</p>

<p>On October 24, 2025, the MeerKAT radio telescope in South Africa detected unusual radio emissions from the comet. This initial detection prompted further analysis, revealing emissions consistent with hydroxyl (OH) maser emissions caused by sublimating water ice.</p>

<p>The closest approach to Earth is set for December 19, 2025, at a safe distance of approximately 27 million kilometers.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The detection of radio emissions from 3I/ATLAS is a significant scientific event. It confirms the presence of water in this interstellar object, allowing us to study its outgassing process,” said a NASA spokesperson.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable for being the third confirmed interstellar object, following 1I/’Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Its unique characteristics offer valuable insights into the diversity of planetary building blocks across the galaxy.</p>

<p>The confirmed presence of water suggests that essential ingredients for life may be common in other systems, enhancing our understanding of planetary formation and the potential for habitable worlds.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The observation campaign will continue until 3I/ATLAS moves away on its journey back to interstellar space. NASA and ESA will analyze the data collected to refine models of planetary formation and assess the implications for the prevalence of life in the universe.</p>
