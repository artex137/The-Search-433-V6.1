      <h2>Hubble spots odd triple jets on interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as radio search finds no alien signal</h2>

<p>New Hubble images have revealed a three-jet pattern on interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, according to Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb. The comet, which is the third known interstellar object, is currently heading out of the solar system following a close pass of Earth on December 19, 2025. A recent radio search conducted by the Breakthrough Listen program has reported no candidate signals from the object, despite extensive observations.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it adds to the intrigue surrounding 3I/ATLAS, which is only the third object identified from beyond our solar system, following 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov. The unusual appearance of the comet has sparked debates about the possibility of artificial origins, prompting researchers to search for potential “technosignatures” indicative of extraterrestrial technology.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2025</li>
    <li>Hubble images taken on: November 30, December 12, and December 27, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth during Hubble observations: approximately 286 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Comet classification: Interstellar comet on a hyperbolic path, not bound to the Sun</li>
    <li>Initial report to the Minor Planet Center: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Breakthrough Listen program’s search frequency: 1–12 gigahertz</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, the NASA-funded ATLAS survey telescope in Chile reported the discovery of 3I/ATLAS to the Minor Planet Center. The comet made its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025. Hubble Space Telescope captured images of the comet on November 30, December 12, and December 27, 2025, revealing a three-jet pattern.</p>
<p>On December 18, 2025, the Breakthrough Listen program utilized the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope to search for signals from the comet, ultimately reporting no candidate signals.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, “The equal angular separations of 360 degrees divided by 3 among these three jet axes is puzzling.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loeb also noted that while the jets could fit a natural explanation related to the comet's rotation, “the geometry warrants further scrutiny.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The debate surrounding 3I/ATLAS's potential artificial origins has extended beyond academic discussions. Writer Rafi Glick, in a January 1 post on The Times of Israel’s blogging platform, described the comet as a “wake-up call” for a coordinated global response to future interstellar visitors, suggesting a role for the United Nations.</p>
<p>Most astronomers maintain that 3I/ATLAS is a natural comet influenced by sunlight and rotation, but the peculiar structure of its jets raises questions about the diversity of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues to recede from the solar system, researchers will analyze the data already collected to understand the comet's unusual features before it fades from view.</p>
