      <h2>NASA Tracks Mysterious Interstellar Comet 3I/Atlas: When and How to See It</h2>

<p>NASA scientists have confirmed that the rare interstellar comet 3I/Atlas is now approaching its peak visibility, marking a significant astronomical event. This comet, only the third interstellar object detected passing through our solar system, has drawn attention from both researchers and skywatchers alike.</p>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/Atlas, discovered by NASA and its partners at the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in Hawaii, is expected to be at its brightest between October 28 and November 2, 2025. Its approach offers a unique opportunity to study the chemical and physical properties of interstellar materials, providing insights into planetary system formation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/Atlas</li>
    <li><strong>Discovered by:</strong> NASA and ATLAS in Hawaii</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Over 60 kilometers per second</li>
    <li><strong>Peak Visibility:</strong> October 28 to November 2, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Best Viewing Conditions:</strong> Dark, rural areas</li>
    <li><strong>Observation Tools:</strong> Mid-range telescopes or powerful binoculars</li>
    <li><strong>Expected Visibility Duration:</strong> Through mid-November 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas was first detected by NASA's ATLAS program in Hawaii. Since its discovery, scientists have monitored its trajectory and composition. The comet is expected to reach its closest point to Earth between October 28 and November 2, 2025, when it will be at its brightest.</p>
<p>NASA's Infrared Telescope Facility and the Hubble Space Telescope are actively tracking the comet to analyze its characteristics and emissions. The comet's unusual speed and composition have sparked renewed interest in studying interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This is a messenger from another star system — a time capsule carrying information about how other planetary systems form,” said Dr. Kelly Fast, program manager for NASA’s Near-Earth Object Observations program.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Each interstellar comet is like a letter delivered from another corner of the galaxy,” explained Dr. Thomas Zurbuchen, former NASA science associate administrator. “By studying 3I/Atlas, we can learn how universal the building blocks of life and planetary systems truly are.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas is the third interstellar object recorded in history, following ‘Oumuamua in 2017 and Comet Borisov in 2019. The previous discoveries have provided valuable insights into the nature of interstellar bodies, with 3I/Atlas displaying characteristics of both comets and interstellar visitors.</p>
<p>The current interest in 3I/Atlas has prompted discussions within NASA about developing spacecraft to study interstellar objects, as well as evaluating potential missions like the European Space Agency's Comet Interceptor Mission and NASA's Interstellar Probe.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/Atlas approaches its peak visibility, NASA will continue to gather data on its composition and trajectory. Observers are encouraged to take advantage of this rare celestial event while the comet remains visible until mid-November 2025.</p>
