      <h2>Scientists reveal that interstellar comet 3I/Atlas is a primitive body ejected from another system</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/Atlas, the third confirmed object from outside the Solar System, has reached its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of approximately 270 million kilometers. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this event.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant because it provides insights into the composition and characteristics of celestial bodies from other star systems. Authorities, including NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA), have mobilized ground and space telescopes to monitor the comet and gather data on its properties.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Closest approach:</strong> December 19, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Earth:</strong> Approximately 270 million kilometers</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery:</strong> July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS system in Chile</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Approximately 58 km/s relative to the Sun</li>
    <li><strong>Perihelion:</strong> October 2025, at 1.4 astronomical units from the Sun</li>
    <li><strong>Composition:</strong> Rich in carbon and metals, similar to carbonaceous chondrite meteorites</li>
    <li><strong>Future observations:</strong> Expected to continue until 2026</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, astronomers detected 3I/Atlas while it was already within the orbit of Jupiter. The object followed a hyperbolic trajectory, confirming its interstellar origin. The comet showed marginal activity in early observations, which was later confirmed with images of its coma and tail. By October 2025, perihelion occurred within the orbit of Mars, where the comet displayed significant gas emissions and changes in brightness.</p>

<p>As the comet approached the Sun, phenomena such as cryovolcanism were observed, contributing to its increasing brightness. The Hubble Space Telescope captured detailed images, while ESA missions recorded the object from unique perspectives. The coordinated campaign involved multiple agencies to maximize data collection.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The 3I/Atlas differs from previous interstellar objects in its composition and activity, providing a unique opportunity to study primordial materials,” said a spokesperson from NASA.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“This comet’s characteristics may offer insights into the formation of planetary systems and the distribution of volatiles in the galaxy,” an ESA representative stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous interstellar objects include 1I/'Oumuamua, which showed no cometary activity, and 2I/Borisov, which resembled local comets. The discovery of 3I/Atlas emphasizes the diversity of small bodies in distant systems and their implications for understanding the evolution of celestial materials.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Observations of 3I/Atlas will continue until it becomes indistinguishable, expected in 2026. Future missions, such as ESA’s Comet Interceptor, are being prepared to intercept similar objects in the future.</p>
