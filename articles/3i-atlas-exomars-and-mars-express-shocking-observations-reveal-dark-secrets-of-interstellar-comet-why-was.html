      <h2>3I/ATLAS Comet Observed by ESA Orbiters Near Mars</h2>
<p>The European Space Agency’s (ESA) ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter and Mars Express have captured significant observations of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it passed near Mars between October 1 and 7, 2025. The observations occurred when the comet was approximately 30 million kilometers away from both spacecraft on October 3.</p>

<h2>Importance of Observations</h2>
<p>This event marks a rare opportunity for scientists to study the composition, behavior, and origin of an interstellar comet. Authorities are analyzing the data collected from the observations to gain insights into the comet's characteristics and its implications for understanding celestial bodies outside the Solar System.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS observed from October 1 to 7, 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest approach was approximately 30 million kilometers from Mars on October 3.</li>
    <li>Images captured using the Colour and Stereo Surface Imaging System (CaSSIS).</li>
    <li>Nucleus estimated to be a few kilometers wide, surrounded by a coma several thousand kilometers across.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar comet observed, following 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov.</li>
    <li>Comet first spotted on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>It is estimated to be three billion years older than the Solar System.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Chile. The comet then passed near Mars from October 1 to 7, 2025, with the closest approach occurring on October 3. The ESA orbiters conducted imaging and spectral measurements during this period. Further observations are planned, with ESA's Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer set to observe the comet in November 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    <p>“Responding to unexpected events like 3I/ATLAS is exciting,” said Colin Wilson, ESA project scientist for both orbiters. “Further analysis will reveal more about the comet.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <p>Nick Thomas, principal investigator for CaSSIS, noted that the comet is “10,000 to 100,000 times fainter than typical targets,” making observation challenging.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third interstellar comet ever observed, providing unique insights into the formation of celestial bodies outside the Solar System. Its characteristics may help scientists understand the early conditions of planetary systems. Previous interstellar comets, 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have also contributed to this understanding.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>ESA plans to analyze the data collected from the ExoMars and Mars Express observations in the coming weeks. The Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer will observe 3I/ATLAS after its closest approach to the Sun, with results expected in February 2026. Additionally, ESA is preparing for the Comet Interceptor mission, scheduled for launch in 2029, to study pristine comets or interstellar objects like 3I/ATLAS.</p>
