      <h2>Cosmic traveler 3I/Atlas crosses the solar system at 57 km/s confirming interstellar origin</h2>

<p>An object from another star system, now officially designated as comet 3I/Atlas, is currently traversing the solar system at a speed of 57 kilometers per second. The comet's trajectory and speed provide definitive proof of its interstellar origin. Observers note that 3I/Atlas will make a single close approach to the Sun before continuing its journey into deep space.</p>

<p>The passage of 3I/Atlas is significant for the scientific community, as it marks only the third confirmed detection of an object from outside the solar system. The previous two were ‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Scientists are mobilizing worldwide to collect data during this brief observation window, which presents a rare opportunity to analyze a fragment of a distant planetary system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas is traveling at 57 km/s.</li>
    <li>It is the third confirmed interstellar object detected, after ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov.</li>
    <li>The comet will make a single close approach to the Sun, with no chance of being captured into orbit.</li>
    <li>3I/Atlas follows a hyperbolic trajectory, indicating its interstellar origin.</li>
    <li>Continuous telescope data is being used to refine its orbital calculations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas has been detected as it approaches the Sun, marking its entry into our solar neighborhood. The comet's trajectory suggests it has been ejected from its home star system, likely due to gravitational interactions or catastrophic events. Observations are ongoing as scientists refine their understanding of its path and characteristics.</p>

<p>As it approaches perihelion, the point of closest approach to the Sun, researchers are focused on detailing its speed and trajectory. The gravitational pull of the Sun will alter its path but will not capture it.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The unique characteristics of 3I/Atlas offer us a window into the conditions of its home star system,” said an astronomer involved in the study. “Each interstellar visitor helps build our understanding of planetary formation across the galaxy.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to 3I/Atlas, interstellar objects like ‘Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov have provided insights into the diversity of planetary systems. ‘Oumuamua's unusual acceleration raised questions about its composition, while 2I/Borisov confirmed similarities with solar system comets. The arrival of 3I/Atlas adds a crucial data point for comparative studies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to monitor 3I/Atlas to gather data on its trajectory and potential non-gravitational acceleration. This information will help determine whether outgassing propulsion is a common feature among interstellar travelers, enhancing our understanding of the formation of celestial bodies in various star systems.</p>
