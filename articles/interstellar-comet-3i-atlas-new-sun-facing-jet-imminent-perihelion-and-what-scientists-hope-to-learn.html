      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS: New Sun-Facing Jet, Imminent Perihelion, and What Scientists Hope to Learn</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has unveiled a prominent sun-facing jet just days before its closest approach to the Sun, which is expected around October 29–30, 2025. This event marks a significant moment for scientists as they prepare to study its chemistry and interaction with solar wind.</p>

<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS, cataloged as C/2025 N1, is essential as it provides researchers with a rare opportunity to examine unaltered material from a distant planetary nursery. The comet's activity has heightened scientific interest, with multiple spacecraft and observatories positioned to analyze its dust and gas composition as it nears perihelion.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comet Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1)</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> Early July 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Perihelion Date:</strong> October 29–30, 2025 (UTC)</li>
    <li><strong>Peak Activity Window:</strong> Late October through early November 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Water Loss Rate:</strong> Estimated at tens of kilograms per second</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in early July 2025 and identified as a hyperbolic, one-time visitor to our solar system. As it approaches perihelion, the comet has exhibited increasing activity, including the formation of a sunward jet. The latest observations indicate that this jet is structured and bright, providing insights into the comet's material composition.</p>

<p>As the comet nears perihelion, researchers are conducting spectroscopy and imaging to analyze its features. Ground observers are also tracking its brightness and position in the sky, despite the challenges posed by visibility.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The jet’s structure and brightness encode clues about the grain sizes and volatile ices involved,” said a spokesperson from the research team. “This activity peaks as we approach perihelion, making it an exciting time for observations.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object, following 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Each of these comets offers unique insights into their origins and the conditions of their home systems. While 1I/ʻOumuamua displayed non-cometary characteristics, 2I/Borisov exhibited typical comet features.</p>

<p>3I/ATLAS serves as a second clear cometary template from beyond our solar system, allowing scientists to compare the chemical compositions and behaviors of interstellar comets with those formed within our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its approach to perihelion, scientists will monitor its jet evolution, spectral fingerprints of water and gases, and interactions with solar wind. These observations will enhance understanding of the comet's structure and the conditions of its formation.</p>
