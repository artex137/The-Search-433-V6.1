      <h2>Comet Lemmon might be the best comet of 2025</h2>

<p>Comet Lemmon (C/2025 A6) is expected to be the most prominent comet of 2025, particularly for observers in the Northern Hemisphere. The comet will be closest to Earth on October 21, 2025, and will continue to brighten, potentially becoming visible to the naked eye around October 31 or November 1.</p>

<p>This event matters for astronomy enthusiasts and casual observers alike, as Comet Lemmon offers a rare opportunity to view a bright comet in the night sky. Astronomers have noted that, while the comet is currently not visible without optical aid, it is expected to become brighter throughout October.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Closest approach to Earth:</strong> October 21, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Brightest visibility:</strong> October 31 to November 1, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Closest point to the sun:</strong> November 8, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Magnitude estimates:</strong> Ranges from magnitude 4 to 2.5</li>
    <li><strong>Discovery:</strong> January 3, 2025, by astronomers at Mt. Lemmon, Arizona</li>
    <li><strong>Orbital period:</strong> Approximately 1,350 years</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet Lemmon was discovered on January 3, 2025, using a 60-inch (1.5-meter) telescope at Mt. Lemmon in Arizona. Precovery images of the comet date back to November 12, 2024, but it was not recognized until it was rediscovered. As it approaches Earth, it will pass near Cor Caroli, the brightest star in Canes Venatici, on October 16, 2025.</p>

<p>During the first half of October, the comet will remain dim, around magnitude 7, and only visible with optical aid. By mid-October, it will become easier to see in the evening sky, reaching its brightest point in late October and early November, when it may be visible without assistance from dark-sky locations.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Comet Lemmon might be the brightest comet of 2025. It could become bright enough to see with your eye alone in late October and early November,” said an astronomer involved in the study of the comet.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet Lemmon is part of a larger group of comets currently visible in the sky. Another notable comet is 3I/ATLAS, which is expected to pass closest to the sun in late October 2025. Comet SWAN may also become visible to the unaided eye from dark-sky locations as of early October 2025.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As Comet Lemmon approaches its closest point to Earth, astronomers will continue to monitor its brightness and trajectory. Observers are encouraged to find optimal viewing locations to catch a glimpse of this significant celestial event.</p>
