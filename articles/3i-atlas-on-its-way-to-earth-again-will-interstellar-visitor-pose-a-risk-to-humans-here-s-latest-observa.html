      <h2>3I/ATLAS on its way to Earth again, will interstellar visitor pose a risk to humans? Here's latest observations</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar comet discovered by the ATLAS survey in Chile, is approaching Earth and will make its closest approach on December 19. According to NASA and other astronomers, the comet poses no risk to humans or the planet.</p>

<p>This is significant as 3I/ATLAS has sparked debate regarding its origins and behavior. Authorities, including NASA and Harvard University, are closely monitoring the comet's activity and characteristics as it draws nearer.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Closest approach: December 19, 2023</li>
    <li>Speed: Approximately 244,600 kilometres per hour</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth at closest approach: 269 million kilometres</li>
    <li>Discovery date: July 1, 2022</li>
    <li>Perihelion (closest point to the Sun): October 29, 2023</li>
    <li>Observing agencies: NASA, Harvard University, Lowell Observatory</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2022, by the ATLAS survey in Chile. It passed its perihelion on October 29, 2023, and has been observed since then by telescopes in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>On November 10, reports emerged suggesting that the comet may have fragmented after reappearing from behind the Sun. However, astronomer Qicheng Zhang from the Lowell Observatory confirmed that the comet appears stable.</p>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches the Sun, it has exhibited changes in speed and color, prompting further investigation by scientists.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“There is no sign that the nucleus broke apart,” said Qicheng Zhang from the Lowell Observatory.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“There are no indications that 3I/ATLAS is an alien spacecraft,” wrote Jason Wright from Penn State University in his blog.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Nasa navigation engineer Davide Farnocchia noted that the comet’s “non-gravitational acceleration” is due to gas and dust being expelled as it approaches the Sun.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is only the third known interstellar visitor, following Oumuamua and Borisov. Its discovery provides valuable data on how material from other star systems travels through space, contributing to our understanding of the chemical composition of early planetary systems.</p>
<p>Previous debates surrounding the comet's nature have included speculation about its potential artificial origins, which experts have largely dismissed as misinterpretations of data.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey, scientists are preparing for further observations in November and December. Any changes in mass or color will help confirm its composition and origin. NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) will continue monitoring the comet as it heads toward Jupiter in March 2026.</p>
