      <h2>Did aliens spy on our nuclear tests? Study finds signs of UFOs near US sites in 1950s</h2>

<p>Researchers from Stockholm University in Sweden and Vanderbilt University in Tennessee have identified potential evidence of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) near U.S. nuclear testing sites during the 1950s. Their study analyzes historical observatory photos taken between 1949 and 1957, revealing flashes of light that correspond with the dates of above-ground nuclear weapons tests.</p>

<p>This research highlights a renewed interest in UFOs in the United States, particularly following three Congressional hearings since July 2023. The findings suggest a possible correlation between nuclear weapons tests and reported UFO sightings, which may have implications for national security and public understanding of unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP).</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Researchers analyzed 106,000 flashes of light from photos taken by the Palomar Observatory in California.</li>
    <li>Flashes were found to be 68% more likely to occur the day after a nuclear test.</li>
    <li>Flashes increased by 8.5% for each reported UFO sighting.</li>
    <li>Findings were published in <em>Scientific Reports</em> on October 20 and in the <em>Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific</em> on October 17.</li>
    <li>Research conducted by astronomer Beatriz Villarroel and anesthesiologist Stephen Bruehl.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Between 1949 and 1957, the Palomar Observatory captured numerous photographs of the night sky. Researchers have now analyzed these images to identify transient star-like objects.</p>
<p>On October 20, 2023, the findings were published, revealing significant statistical correlations between the flashes of light and nuclear testing dates. This research comes amid increased scrutiny of UAPs in the U.S., following three Congressional hearings since July 2023.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The magnitude of the association between these flashes of light and nuclear tests was surprising, as was the very specific time at which they most often occurred ‒ namely, the day after a test,” said Stephen Bruehl, a co-author of the study.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “Today we know that short flashes of light are often solar reflections from flat, highly reflective objects in orbit around the Earth,” said Beatriz Villarroel, another co-author.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The idea that nuclear weapons attract extraterrestrial interest has been a long-standing theme in UFO mythology. The recent research adds to the ongoing dialogue surrounding UAPs, particularly in light of Congressional hearings where military personnel have testified about unexplained aerial phenomena.</p>
<p>These hearings have prompted calls for greater transparency from the U.S. government regarding its investigations into UFO sightings and potential extraterrestrial technology.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Further investigations into the nature of the flashes and their possible connections to UFO sightings are anticipated. Additionally, there may be legislative efforts aimed at increasing transparency about UAPs from the federal government.</p>
