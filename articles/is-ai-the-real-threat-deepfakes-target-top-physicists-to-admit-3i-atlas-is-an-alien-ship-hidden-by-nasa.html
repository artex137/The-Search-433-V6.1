      <h2>Is AI the Real Threat? Deepfakes Target Top Physicists to Admit 3I/ATLAS Is An Alien Ship Hidden by NASA</h2>

<p>Recently, social media has seen a surge of deepfake videos featuring physicists Michio Kaku and Brian Cox, claiming that comet 3I/ATLAS is an alien spacecraft hidden by NASA. The videos have misled thousands of viewers, prompting concern over the use of artificial intelligence in creating deceptive content.</p>

<p>This situation highlights the dangers of deepfake technology, which can create convincing but false representations of individuals. Both Kaku and Cox have publicly denounced these videos, emphasizing the need for social media platforms to improve their monitoring and response to misinformation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Deepfake videos feature Michio Kaku and Brian Cox discussing comet 3I/ATLAS as an alien ship.</li>
    <li>Kaku's original statements contained no mention of aliens or government cover-ups.</li>
    <li>TikTok confirmed removal of the misleading videos for violating misinformation policies.</li>
    <li>YouTube has reportedly taken down several offending clips.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar object observed by NASA.</li>
    <li>Scientific consensus maintains that 3I/ATLAS behaves like a typical comet.</li>
    <li>Factual observations of 3I/ATLAS will be available in early November 2023.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In recent weeks, videos surfaced on social media featuring deepfake representations of physicists Michio Kaku and Brian Cox. These clips falsely claimed that 3I/ATLAS was an alien spacecraft. Kaku and Cox responded to the misinformation, calling for better monitoring by social media companies.</p>

<p>Kaku warned about the rise of unauthorized deepfake videos impersonating him, stating that they spread "crazy false claims." He urged platforms like YouTube and TikTok to act more swiftly against such content. TikTok has confirmed the removal of these videos, while YouTube has acted on several clips.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "There has been a sudden rise of fraudulent unauthorized deep fake AI videos, impersonating me, misleading the public with crazy false claims that are not my own," Kaku stated on X.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    "YouTube is taking too long to remove misleading videos," Cox commented, expressing frustration over the platform's response time.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The emergence of deepfake technology has raised concerns in various sectors, especially regarding misinformation. The current incident involving 3I/ATLAS highlights how easily false narratives can gain traction online. Previous cases of deepfake misuse have prompted calls for stricter regulations and monitoring by social media companies and AI developers.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the spread of deepfake videos are ongoing, with both Kaku and Cox advocating for more stringent actions from social media platforms. The scientific community continues to monitor comet 3I/ATLAS, with factual data expected to be released in early November 2023.</p>
