      <h2>3I/ATLAS interstellar object shows green glow, anti-tail and unusual gas composition</h2>

<p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS has exhibited new and unusual features in recent observations, including a green glow and an anti-tail, according to scientists. These findings emerged from data collected by the Hubble Space Telescope and other observatories as the object approached the Sun in September 2025.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it enhances understanding of interstellar objects and their behavior. Researchers are continuing to monitor 3I/ATLAS to gather more data on its composition and unique characteristics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date of observations:</strong> September 7, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Key emissions detected:</strong> Cyanide (CN), carbon dioxide (87% by mass), carbon monoxide (9%), water (4%)</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from the Sun:</strong> Less than 3.3 astronomical units (AU)</li>
    <li><strong>Notable features:</strong> Green glow, anti-tail directed toward the Sun</li>
    <li><strong>Lead researcher:</strong> Avi Loeb, head of the Galileo Project</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On March 28, 2025, the ATLAS telescope team first detected activity from 3I/ATLAS. By August 25, 2025, data from the Very Large Telescope confirmed increased cyanide and nickel emissions as the object neared the Sun. Observations on July 21, 2025, by the Hubble Space Telescope revealed scattered light extending toward the Sun, contrary to typical comet behavior.</p>
<p>On August 6, 2025, the Webb Telescope provided additional data, which was supported by SPHEREx observations from August 8 to 12, 2025, detailing the gas composition surrounding the object.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The development of the anti-tail, gas plume structure, and color shift all demonstrate how 3I/ATLAS can expand understanding of interstellar visitors,” said Avi Loeb.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has shown significant differences from prior interstellar objects. The first known interstellar object, 1I/ʻOumuamua, displayed unexplained acceleration and lacked gas or dust. The second, 2I/Borisov, resembled a typical comet. In contrast, 3I/ATLAS exhibits strong gas emissions and an anti-tail phenomenon, marking it as a unique case in interstellar studies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its approach to the Sun, researchers expect changes in its gas production and tail structure. Observatories, including Hubble and Webb, will keep monitoring the object to gain further insights into its characteristics and behavior.</p>
