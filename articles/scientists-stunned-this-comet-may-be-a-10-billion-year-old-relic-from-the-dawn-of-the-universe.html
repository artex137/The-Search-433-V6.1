      <h2>Scientists stunned: This comet may be a 10-billion-year-old relic from the dawn of the universe</h2>

<p>Astronomers have disclosed that comet 3I/Atlas, which passed through our solar system in July 2022, could be a 10-billion-year-old relic from the universe's dawn. This revelation has captured the attention of the scientific community, as the comet may provide insights into the formation of the earliest planetary systems.</p>

<p>The significance of this finding lies in its potential to reshape our understanding of cosmic history. Researchers from the University of La Coruña in Spain have challenged previous theories about the comet's origins, suggesting it has traveled through space long before our solar system existed. They are using data from the European Space Agency's Gaia mission to trace the comet's journey.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas observed in July 2022.</li>
    <li>Potential age: 10 billion years.</li>
    <li>Research led by University of La Coruña.</li>
    <li>Data sourced from the European Space Agency's Gaia mission.</li>
    <li>Analysis of over 13 million stars conducted.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2022, astronomers first observed comet 3I/Atlas. Its unusual characteristics drew immediate attention. Initially, scientists considered that gravitational interactions with nearby stars might have altered its trajectory. However, researchers from the University of La Coruña later proposed a new theory, suggesting that the comet could be a relic from the dawn of the universe.</p>

<p>The team analyzed data from the Gaia mission, tracking the orbits of more than 13 million stars to retrace the comet's path. They identified 93 stellar encounters but found no significant disturbances affecting the comet's trajectory. This led to the conclusion that 3I/Atlas is not a recent visitor but has been traveling for billions of years.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “This object is a cosmic relic,” said Xabier Pérez Couto, lead author of the study. “It provides a unique opportunity to study the evolution of objects from other star systems, which was previously purely theoretical.”
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “Every observation we make of 3I/Atlas opens a window into the past of the universe. It’s like a fossil from the dawn of time, carrying with it a story about the formation of the first planetary systems,” Pérez Couto added.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This discovery could potentially change our understanding of cosmic objects and their origins. Prior studies have often focused on more recent interstellar visitors. The findings regarding 3I/Atlas highlight the importance of long-term astronomical observations and advanced tracking methods provided by missions like Gaia.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists plan to continue studying 3I/Atlas to uncover more secrets about the early universe and the origins of stars and planets in our galaxy.</p>
