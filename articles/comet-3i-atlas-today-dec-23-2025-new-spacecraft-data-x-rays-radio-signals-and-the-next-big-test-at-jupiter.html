      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Today (Dec. 23, 2025): New Spacecraft Data, X‑Rays, “Radio Signals,” and the Next Big Test at Jupiter</h2>

<p>On December 23, 2025, Comet 3I/ATLAS, the third confirmed interstellar object observed in our solar system, continues to generate interest as it departs after its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025. The comet did not pose any danger to Earth, as it was located about 1.8 astronomical units—approximately 170 million miles (270 million kilometers)—from Earth during its closest approach.</p>

<p>Space agencies, including NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA), have been analyzing data collected from the comet, revealing unique characteristics. This analysis includes the first recorded X-ray glow from an interstellar comet, produced as the comet's gases interact with the solar wind. Researchers are using this data to study the comet's composition and behavior, which may provide insights into planetary formation beyond our solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>Distance at closest approach: 1.8 astronomical units (170 million miles or 270 million kilometers).</li>
    <li>Speed at perihelion: Approximately 153,000 mph (246,000 km/h).</li>
    <li>Diameter estimates of the comet's nucleus: Between 1,400 feet (440 m) and 3.5 miles (5.6 km).</li>
    <li>Observation period by ESA's XRISM: November 26–28, 2025.</li>
    <li>NASA's Parker Solar Probe observed the comet from October 18 to November 5, 2025.</li>
    <li>Next major waypoint for the comet: Jupiter.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the NASA-funded ATLAS survey telescope in Río Hurtado, Chile. It reached perihelion, its closest point to the Sun, on October 30, 2025, at a distance of about 130 million miles (210 million kilometers) from the Sun. Following its closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, the comet has continued on its trajectory out of the solar system.</p>

<p>During its journey, the comet has been observed by multiple spacecraft, including NASA's Parker Solar Probe and the Europa Clipper, which has provided valuable insights into its composition and behavior. The ESA's XRISM mission captured X-ray data of the comet, marking a significant milestone in the study of interstellar comets.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS is becoming a laboratory for how ‘foreign’ comet chemistry behaves inside a very familiar heliosphere,” said a NASA spokesperson.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The strongest scientific case for any interstellar comet is not ‘mystery,’ but comparative planet formation,” an ESA representative stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is significant because it offers a rare opportunity to study the remnants of a body that formed around a different star. This comet is part of a growing interest in interstellar objects, as researchers seek to understand their role in the formation of planetary systems. The unique properties of 3I/ATLAS, particularly the detection of X-rays, highlight the advances in observational technology that allow for more detailed studies of such objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As Comet 3I/ATLAS continues its journey out of the solar system, researchers will analyze the data collected from various spacecraft to understand its composition and behavior. The next major waypoint for the comet will be its approach to Jupiter, where further observations may yield additional insights into its characteristics.</p>
