      <h2>NASA releases images of Comet 3I/ATLAS: It ‘doesn’t look like a spacecraft’</h2>

<p>NASA has released new images of Comet 3I/ATLAS, which is currently traveling back into interstellar space after passing near Mars in early October. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in relation to the comet.</p>

<p>The release of these images comes after a 43-day U.S. government shutdown, during which NASA did not acknowledge the existence of the photographs. NASA officials emphasized that the comet, which originated from beyond the solar system, shows no signs of being anything other than a comet. Amit Kshatriya, the associate administrator of NASA, addressed conspiracy theories, stating, “This object is a comet. It looks and behaves like a comet.”</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is on its way out of the solar system after its closest approach to the sun last month.</li>
    <li>The comet was first spotted in July 2023 by ground-based telescopes.</li>
    <li>NASA spacecraft captured images of the comet from various vantage points, including the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.</li>
    <li>The comet is traveling at speeds exceeding 150,000 mph.</li>
    <li>It will come closest to Earth on December 19, 2023, at a distance of approximately 170 million miles.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2023, astronomers using Earth-based telescopes first identified Comet 3I/ATLAS. The comet made its closest approach to the sun in late October, passing just inside the orbit of Mars. During this time, NASA's spacecraft, including the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, captured images of the comet. Following a government shutdown, NASA released these images to the public last week.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “I’d like to address the rumors right at the beginning. This object is a comet. It looks and behaves like a comet.” 
    <strong>Amit Kshatriya, associate administrator of NASA</strong>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “It’s different, and yet it’s still coffee.” 
    <strong>Tom Statler, lead scientist at NASA for solar system small bodies</strong>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “There’s nothing obvious that jumps out. It definitely looks like a comet. Yes, it’s fuzzy. It’s got a coma. Doesn’t look like a spacecraft.” 
    <strong>Alfred McEwen, professor of planetary geology, University of Arizona</strong>
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS has garnered significant attention due to its interstellar origin and unique characteristics. Some scientists, including Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb, have speculated about the possibility of extraterrestrial technology based on the comet's peculiarities. However, NASA officials have stated that they have not detected any signs of such technology.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA plans to continue monitoring Comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth and later passes by Jupiter in spring 2024. Ongoing observations will help scientists gather more information about the comet's composition and behavior.</p>
