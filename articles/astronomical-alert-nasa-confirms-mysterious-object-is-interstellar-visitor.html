      <h2>Astronomical alert: NASA confirms mysterious object is ‘interstellar’ visitor</h2>

<p>A mysterious object identified as comet 3I/Atlas has been confirmed by NASA as an interstellar visitor, making it only the third such object ever detected. The comet, discovered by NASA's ATLAS (Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System) survey telescope in Chile, is currently moving through space and was first reported in July 2025.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it provides insights into objects originating outside our solar system. NASA has stated that 3I/Atlas poses no threat to Earth, as it will pass at a distance of approximately 150 million miles. Scientists are currently studying its size and composition, as it travels at an extraordinary speed of about 152,000 mph.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas is the third interstellar object ever identified.</li>
    <li>Discovered by NASA's ATLAS telescope in July 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet is traveling at approximately 152,000 mph.</li>
    <li>It is currently about 150 million miles from Earth.</li>
    <li>3I/Atlas will be visible to ground-based telescopes through September 2025.</li>
    <li>It will reappear on the other side of the sun by early December 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, NASA's ATLAS telescope in Chile identified the comet 3I/Atlas. Following its discovery, NASA confirmed its classification as an interstellar object. The comet has since been observed traveling towards the sun at a remarkable speed.</p>

<p>Throughout September 2025, scientists have been studying 3I/Atlas to gather data on its size and composition. Observations are ongoing until the comet approaches the sun too closely for visibility.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “3I/Atlas is a unique object that provides a rare opportunity to study materials from outside our solar system,” said a NASA spokesperson.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The identification of 3I/Atlas follows the detection of two previous interstellar objects: Comet 2I/Borisov in 2019 and ‘Oumuamua in 2017. Both objects sparked significant interest in the scientific community due to their unusual characteristics and origins.</p>

<p>NASA has been closely monitoring these interstellar visitors as they offer insights into the formation and evolution of celestial bodies beyond our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to observe 3I/Atlas until it becomes too close to the sun for visibility. Following its passage, they will analyze data collected to understand more about its composition and origin.</p>
