      <h2>Comet or spaceship? NASA responds after interstellar visitor 3I/ATLAS suddenly brightens</h2>

<p>NASA's SPHEREx space telescope has observed interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS dramatically brightening as it exits the solar system in December 2025. The comet underwent a significant outburst of gas, dust, and complex molecules, revealing new insights into material formed around another star.</p>

<p>This event is important because it provides scientists with unprecedented data about the chemical composition of interstellar objects. NASA officials have stated that these observations could enhance understanding of the origins of organic materials in the universe.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS brightened significantly in December 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope in Rio Hurtado, Chile.</li>
    <li>SPHEREx captured images of the comet during its close approach to the Sun.</li>
    <li>Organic molecules detected include methanol, cyanide, and methane.</li>
    <li>The comet is only the third known interstellar object detected in the solar system.</li>
    <li>SPHEREx launched on March 11, 2025, and has completed its first all-sky infrared map.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025. The comet made its closest approach to the Sun shortly thereafter. Initial observations in August 2025 showed a coma dominated by carbon dioxide.</p>

<p>By December 2025, SPHEREx data indicated a dramatic increase in activity and brightness, attributed to the sublimation of subsurface ices. This outburst occurred nearly two months after the comet's closest approach.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Comet 3I/ATLAS was full-on erupting into space in December 2025, after its close flyby of the Sun, causing it to significantly brighten,” said Carey Lisse, study lead at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The comet has spent ages traversing interstellar space, being bombarded by highly energetic cosmic rays,” said Phil Korngut, the mission’s instrument scientist at Caltech. “But now that the Sun’s energy has had time to penetrate deep into the comet, the pristine ices below the surface are warming up and erupting.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable as only the third interstellar object identified within the solar system. Previous interstellar objects have provided valuable data about the conditions of other star systems and the materials that can form in them.</p>

<p>The SPHEREx mission aims to enhance understanding of the universe by mapping the sky in infrared wavelengths, gathering data on comets, asteroids, and near-Earth objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA plans to continue analyzing data from SPHEREx to refine the trajectory and composition of comet 3I/ATLAS. Ongoing studies will focus on understanding the implications of this outburst for the broader field of astrophysics.</p>
