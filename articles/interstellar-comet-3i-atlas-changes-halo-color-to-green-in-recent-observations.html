      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS changes halo color to green in recent observations</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has exhibited a notable change in the color of its gaseous halo, transitioning to a green hue following its closest approach to the Sun on October 29, 2025. Observations taken after this perihelion reveal the comet’s coma, which is the envelope of gas and dust surrounding it, now predominantly green as it prepares for its upcoming close pass to Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of approximately 269 million kilometers.</p>

<p>This change is significant as experts attribute the green color to the emission of light by diatomic carbon (C2) molecules released as the comet heats up. NASA and other space agencies are monitoring the comet closely, utilizing various telescopes to gather data on its chemical composition and behavior as it approaches Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was identified on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS telescope system in Chile.</li>
    <li>Perihelion occurred on October 29, 2025, marking the comet's peak brightness and activity.</li>
    <li>The comet will pass Earth on December 19, 2025, at a distance of about 269 million kilometers.</li>
    <li>It travels at an excess speed of approximately 58 km/s relative to the Sun.</li>
    <li>Observations show a transition of the halo color from red to green after perihelion.</li>
    <li>Telescopes such as Hubble and Gemini have provided critical data on the comet's composition.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected on July 1, 2025, revealing its interstellar origin. The comet approached Mars in October, followed by a pass near Venus in November. It reached perihelion on October 29, 2025, when it exhibited significant brightness and activity. Following this, observations indicated a change in halo color to green, attributed to the release of gases as the comet heated up due to solar proximity. The comet is set to pass close to Earth on December 19, 2025, before continuing on its trajectory towards Jupiter in March 2026.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The change in color of the comet’s halo provides important insights into its chemical composition and the processes occurring as it approaches the Sun,” said a spokesperson from NASA.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“This phenomenon highlights the unique characteristics of interstellar comets and enriches our understanding of their formation,” noted an astronomer involved in the monitoring efforts.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar comet, following ‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Unlike comets from the solar system, 3I/ATLAS does not orbit the Sun in a closed path, instead heading into deep space after its passage. The comet's unique features and chemical evolution provide valuable data for understanding the formation of planetary systems beyond our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and other agencies will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth. Observations will focus on its changes in brightness and composition, with potential for detecting larger gas plumes in the coming months.</p>
