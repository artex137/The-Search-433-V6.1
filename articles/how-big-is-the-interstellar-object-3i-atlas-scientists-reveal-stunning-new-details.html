      <h2>How big is the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS? Scientists reveal stunning new details</h2>

<p>NASA's ATLAS telescope has discovered a massive interstellar object, known as 3I/ATLAS, which could be as large as Manhattan and weigh approximately 33 billion tons. The object was first observed on July 1, 2023, and is currently moving through our solar system.</p>

<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS has ignited significant interest and speculation among scientists and the public. Authorities and researchers are now focused on studying this object to determine its true nature and implications for our understanding of the universe.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object Name: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Discovery Date: July 1, 2023</li>
    <li>Estimated Size: Approximately 3 miles (4.8 kilometers) wide</li>
    <li>Estimated Weight: About 33 billion tons</li>
    <li>Next Close Pass: Expected near Mars on October 3, 2023</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>NASA first detected 3I/ATLAS on July 1, 2023. Following its discovery, Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has suggested that the object may not just be a comet but possibly an ancient alien probe. As discussions about the object's characteristics and potential origins continue, scientists have been preparing for its close approach to Mars.</p>

<p>On October 3, 2023, a spacecraft currently orbiting Mars is expected to gather new data as 3I/ATLAS makes its close pass. This event will provide researchers with an opportunity to observe the object more closely, despite its path taking it through the Sun's glare, which complicates direct observations from Earth.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Given the limited reservoir of heavy elements, we should have discovered on the order of a hundred thousand interstellar objects on the 0.1-kilometer scale of 1I/`Oumuamua before finding 3I/ATLAS, yet we only detected two interstellar objects previously,” said Avi Loeb, highlighting the rarity of such a large object.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “If scientists see any strange movements as it moves, that could mean that it is being propelled by a technologically manufactured engine,” Loeb added, further emphasizing the intrigue surrounding 3I/ATLAS.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS follows the discovery of 'Oumuamua in 2017, another interstellar object that sparked debates about its potential origins. The ongoing analysis of 3I/ATLAS has reignited discussions about the possibility of extraterrestrial technology and the search for life beyond Earth.</p>

<p>While scientists primarily consider 3I/ATLAS to be a comet, its unusual characteristics have led to speculation about its origins and nature, keeping the scientific community engaged in further exploration.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches Mars, scientists will conduct observations to gather more information about the object. Following its close pass, astronomers plan to track it as it exits our solar system, with hopes of making additional observations near Jupiter.</p>
