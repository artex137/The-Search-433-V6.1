      <h2>New infrared observations reveal comet 3I/ATLAS dramatically brightening during farewell tour of the solar system</h2>

<p>New infrared observations have revealed that comet 3I/ATLAS has dramatically brightened during its final journey through the solar system. The observations were captured by NASA's SPHEREx space telescope in December 2025, shortly after the comet's closest approach to the Sun. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This brightening is significant as it provides scientists with an unprecedented look at the chemical composition of materials originating from another star. Authorities are analyzing these findings to understand the implications for planetary formation and the evolution of the solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025 by the ATLAS asteroid survey.</li>
    <li>The comet is the third confirmed interstellar object to pass through the solar system.</li>
    <li>It experienced a dramatic brightening due to a surge of gas, dust, and molecules.</li>
    <li>The observations occurred in December 2025 after its closest approach to the Sun.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS has developed a glowing coma rich in water vapor, carbon dioxide, and organic compounds.</li>
    <li>Unique observations include the detection of water ice, methane, methanol, and cyanide.</li>
    <li>Findings were published in the February 2026 issue of Research Notes of the AAS.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025. It made its closest approach to the Sun in December 2025, during which it exhibited a significant brightening due to an outburst of gas and dust. The SPHEREx space telescope captured these observations, highlighting the comet's vibrant activity.</p>

<p>Following its close flyby, scientists noted that the comet continued to exhibit intense activity, which is atypical for comets that usually fade after their closest approach to the Sun. This unusual behavior has allowed for detailed studies of the comet's chemical composition.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Comet 3I/ATLAS was full-on erupting into space in December 2025, following its close flyby of the sun, causing it to significantly brighten," said Carey Lisse, lead author of the study.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Since comets consist of about one-third bulk water ice, it was releasing an abundance of new, carbon-rich material that had remained locked in ice deep below the surface," Lisse added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is notable as the third interstellar object confirmed to have passed through the solar system, following 1I/'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. Unlike its predecessors, 3I/ATLAS has provided a more extensive chemical display, enabling scientists to gather unique observations that could enhance understanding of the materials necessary for planetary formation.</p>

<p>The findings from SPHEREx contribute to the broader understanding of how interstellar objects can inform us about the early solar system and the potential for life beyond Earth.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to analyze the data collected from the observations of 3I/ATLAS to uncover further insights into the chemistry of interstellar objects. This research may provide valuable information regarding the conditions for planet formation and the distribution of essential materials in the Milky Way.</p>
