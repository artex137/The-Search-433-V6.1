      <h2>India’s space telescope may have spotted 3I/Atlas before NASA’s confirmation</h2>

<p>India’s space telescope, AstroSat, may have detected the interstellar object 3I/Atlas before NASA confirmed its presence, according to a recent report. The detection has drawn significant interest from scientists and space observers globally, particularly due to NASA's silence on the matter over the past few weeks.</p>

<p>The detection of 3I/Atlas is important because it offers insights into the formation of stars and planets outside our solar system. NASA has not disclosed whether it has observed the object with its telescopes or spacecraft, raising questions among the scientific community. Indian scientists are examining their data and plan to share their findings with international research groups.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>AstroSat is India's first space telescope, launched by ISRO in 2015.</li>
    <li>3I/Atlas is only the third interstellar object discovered, following 'Oumuamua in 2017 and Comet Borisov in 2019.</li>
    <li>The object is estimated to be as large as Manhattan and is traveling at a high speed.</li>
    <li>AstroSat detected a faint, rapidly moving object that was not known to be a comet or asteroid.</li>
    <li>Initial studies suggest 3I/Atlas is composed of rock, ice, and metal.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In early 2023, the ATLAS observatory in Hawaii first discovered 3I/Atlas. Following this, AstroSat may have detected the object, although details of the observation are still under verification.</p>
<p>NASA has not confirmed any observations of 3I/Atlas, prompting speculation in the scientific community. Indian scientists have begun analyzing their data and intend to share their findings with international researchers.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We are still verifying the details and comparing the data with foreign observatories,” said Dr. Neeraj Sharma, a scientist involved in the observation.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“AstroSat was designed to observe distant objects, and this vindicates its precision,” stated Dr. Meenakshi Rao, another scientist on the project.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Interstellar objects are extremely rare, remaining close to our solar system for only a brief period. Each sighting provides scientists with unique opportunities to learn about the formation of other solar systems. Detection of 3I/Atlas would mark a significant achievement for Indian astronomy and highlight India's growing role in global space exploration.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue monitoring 3I/Atlas as it approaches the Sun and then returns to deep space. Indian researchers will keep examining their data and provide updates once their analysis is complete.</p>
