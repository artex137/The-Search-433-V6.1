      <h2>Mysterious Comet Might Explain a Signal Beamed at Earth 48 Years Ago</h2>

<p>Avi Loeb, a Harvard astronomer, has suggested that the mysterious comet 3I/ATLAS may explain the infamous "Wow!" signal detected by a radio telescope at Ohio State University in 1977. The signal, which lasted for 72 seconds, has puzzled scientists for decades. Loeb's theory connects the comet to the signal, raising questions about its origins.</p>

<p>This connection matters because it could provide insight into the nature of the "Wow!" signal, which has never been heard again since its discovery. Loeb has called for increased observation of 3I/ATLAS to determine if it might emit a signal that could reveal its true nature, potentially linking it to advanced extraterrestrial technology.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The "Wow!" signal was detected on August 15, 1977.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was discovered in 2023 and is only the third known interstellar object.</li>
    <li>Loeb estimates the odds of a random alignment between the comet and the signal at 0.6 percent.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was approximately 600 astronomical units, or 55 billion miles, away from Earth in 1977.</li>
    <li>No telescope has detected any transmissions from 3I/ATLAS.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On August 15, 1977, the "Wow!" signal was recorded, prompting intrigue and speculation among scientists. In 2023, astronomers discovered 3I/ATLAS, which is thought to be a comet visiting from beyond the solar system. Loeb has since proposed a potential connection between the comet and the historical signal.</p>

<p>Loeb has analyzed the trajectory of both the comet and the signal, concluding that they came from similar directions, which he believes is unlikely to be coincidental. He has suggested that the object could be a technologically advanced artifact from an alien civilization.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The odds of that being a random alignment? About 0.6 percent,” said Loeb, emphasizing the significance of the connection.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“NASA scientists assume it’s just a regular old comet that’s just doing weird things,” Loeb noted, contrasting his own interpretation with more traditional scientific views.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The "Wow!" signal remains one of the most notable unexplained phenomena in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. Since its detection, various theories have emerged, but none have provided a definitive explanation. The discovery of 3I/ATLAS adds a new layer to this ongoing investigation into the origins of the signal and the nature of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Loeb has called for continuous monitoring of 3I/ATLAS in hopes of capturing any potential signals that may offer further insight into its nature, including the possibility of it being an alien artifact.</p>
