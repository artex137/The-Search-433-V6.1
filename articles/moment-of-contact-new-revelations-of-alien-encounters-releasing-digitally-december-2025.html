      <h2>MOMENT OF CONTACT: NEW REVELATIONS OF ALIEN ENCOUNTERS RELEASING DIGITALLY DECEMBER 2025</h2>

<p>Director James Fox has announced that the expanded edition of "Moment of Contact: New Revelations of Alien Encounters" will be released digitally in December 2025. This version includes the first account from a neurosurgeon who claims to have communicated directly with an alien during a 1996 incident in Varginha, Brazil, often referred to as the "Roswell of Brazil." No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with this event.</p>

<p>The film's new revelations are significant as they coincide with recent congressional hearings in the United States, where senior intelligence officials have acknowledged a long-secret UFO crash-retrieval program. The film aims to shed light on the most compelling eyewitness testimony regarding extraterrestrial encounters, intensifying public interest in unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP).</p>
