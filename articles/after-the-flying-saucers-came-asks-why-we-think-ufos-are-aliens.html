      <h2>‘After the Flying Saucers Came’ asks why we think UFOs are aliens</h2>

<p>A new book titled <em>After the Flying Saucers Came: A Global History of the UFO Phenomenon</em> by historian Greg Eghigian has been released by Oxford University Press on November 7, 2024. The book examines the history of belief in UFOs and the cultural factors contributing to the public's fascination with the phenomenon. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities associated with the book's release.</p>

<p>This publication is significant as it adds to the growing body of academic work exploring the societal impact of paranormal beliefs, including UFOs. Eghigian aims to understand why the idea that UFOs are extraterrestrial spacecraft has become the dominant explanation among the public. His approach includes evaluating various claims without endorsing any specific viewpoint.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Title: <em>After the Flying Saucers Came: A Global History of the UFO Phenomenon</em></li>
    <li>Author: Greg Eghigian</li>
    <li>Publisher: Oxford University Press</li>
    <li>Release Date: November 7, 2024</li>
    <li>Focus: Examination of UFO belief and its cultural implications</li>
    <li>Page Count: 400 pages</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In recent years, there has been a surge in academic interest in paranormal phenomena, including UFOs. This has led to the publication of various works, with Eghigian's book being a notable addition. Eghigian has focused on credible sources and verifiable reports while avoiding speculation on the validity of UFO claims.</p>
<p>Historically, Charles Fort was one of the first to argue for the extraterrestrial origin of UFOs, but Eghigian dismisses him as a credible source. He also critiques early ufology figures, including Ray Palmer, Donald Keyhoe, and Erich von Däniken, for lacking credibility.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Eghigian argues that UFO believers and skeptics are mirror images of each other.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Both groups tend to be dominated by white men who are highly educated, but don’t operate within the traditional confines of academia.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The book highlights a long-standing divide between UFO believers and skeptics, particularly regarding their attitudes towards authority. Eghigian notes that believers often distrust scientific authority, while skeptics may revere it to an extreme.</p>
<p>This dynamic has historically impacted research efforts, such as the University of Colorado's UFO Project, which faced internal divisions among researchers.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As interest in UFOs continues, Eghigian's book may influence future discussions and research on the topic. The academic community is likely to engage with his findings and methodologies in ongoing studies of paranormal beliefs.</p>
