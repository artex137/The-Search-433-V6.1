      <h2>3I/Atlas Flies by Mars, Drawing Attention from Multiple Space Agencies</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/Atlas is currently flying by Mars, with key observations being made by orbiters from NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), and China’s Tianwen-1 mission. The comet will be approximately 30 million km from Mars on October 3, 2023, presenting a unique opportunity for scientists to capture images of this interstellar object.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it allows space agencies to study 3I/Atlas, which is expected to move towards the Sun and become obscured by its glare for several weeks. All Mars orbiters have temporarily shifted their focus from Mars to observe the comet, aiming to learn more about its composition and behavior.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/Atlas is 30 million km from Mars as of October 3, 2023.</li>
    <li>The comet will reach a distance of 240 million km from Earth at its closest point.</li>
    <li>The ESA operates the Mars Express and ExoMars Trace Gas orbiters.</li>
    <li>NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) is equipped with the HiRISE camera.</li>
    <li>The comet is currently at magnitude 12 and not visible to the naked eye.</li>
    <li>ESA's Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) will begin observations of the comet on November 2, 2023.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas has approached Mars, allowing for a focused observation period. As the comet nears the Sun, it will become increasingly difficult to study due to the solar glare. The period of closest approach is crucial for gathering data.</p>
<p>On October 29-30, 2023, the comet will reach its closest point to the Sun. JUICE is scheduled to start its observations on November 2, 2023, and will continue until November 25, 2023.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We are not promising anything other than a monochromatic image,” said Colin Wilson, ESA project scientist for the Mars Express and ExoMars Trace Gas orbiters.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Marshall Eubanks from Space Initiatives noted, “The comet appears to be passing through a twisted part of the Sun’s magnetic field, which might create ripples in the comet’s tail.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This is the third interstellar object to be observed by scientists, following previous encounters with Comet 1I/2017 U1 and Comet 2I/Borisov. The study of interstellar comets provides valuable insight into the composition and dynamics of celestial bodies from outside our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will analyze the data collected from various orbiters after 3I/Atlas passes by Mars. Further observations by JUICE are anticipated to provide additional insights during the comet's closest approach to the Sun.</p>
