      <h2>3I/ATLAS Doomsday Fears Persist Ahead of Dec 19 Flyby</h2>

<p>As December 19 approaches, concerns about the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS continue to circulate online, despite assurances from NASA that there is no risk to Earth. The comet, discovered in July 2025 by the ATLAS telescope network, will make its closest approach at approximately 1.8 astronomical units, or 270 million kilometres, on Friday.</p>

<p>This situation matters as misinformation about the comet has proliferated, leading to public anxiety. NASA has reiterated that 3I/ATLAS is not a threat, emphasizing the importance of scientific understanding amid widespread myths and speculation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS discovered in July 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth on December 19, 2025, at 1.8 astronomical units (270 million kilometres).</li>
    <li>Speed exceeds 60 kilometres per second.</li>
    <li>NASA's Near-Earth Object team has monitored the comet since its discovery.</li>
    <li>Comet measures between 0.52 and 0.75 kilometres in diameter.</li>
    <li>NASA states, "There is no danger to Earth from this comet."</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected by the ATLAS telescope network in July 2025. Since then, NASA's Near-Earth Object team has continuously tracked the comet, confirming its hyperbolic trajectory as an interstellar object. As of December 14, 2025, the comet's movements have shown no unusual activity, aligning with typical cometary behavior.</p>

<p>On December 19, 2025, the comet will pass at a distance that is twice the sun's distance from Earth, effectively nullifying concerns about potential collisions.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "There is no danger to Earth from this comet," NASA has stated.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    "There is no doubt that we can learn something new from the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, irrespective of whether it is an icy rock or a spacecraft," wrote Avi Loeb in a Medium post on December 9, 2025.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discourse surrounding 3I/ATLAS reflects ongoing trends in public perception of astronomical phenomena. Misinterpretations of the comet's characteristics have led to speculation about its origins and intentions, often fueled by social media. Despite the scientific community's efforts to clarify these misconceptions, misinformation persists.</p>

<p>Avi Loeb's work has highlighted the importance of open dialogue regarding unusual interstellar objects, as he categorizes 3I/ATLAS with a rating of 4 on the Loeb Scale, indicating significant anomalies while still likely of natural origin.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS approaches its closest point to Earth, NASA continues to monitor its trajectory and share updates to counter misinformation. The scientific community anticipates valuable data from the comet that could enhance understanding of interstellar objects, while public discourse is expected to remain active through the comet's flyby and beyond.</p>
