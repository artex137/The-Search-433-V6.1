      <h2>Halley's Comet was discovered earlier than previously thought - study</h2>

<p>Scientists have reported that the long-period nature of Halley's Comet was recorded centuries earlier than previously believed, with observations dating back to 1066 by the monk Eilmer of Malmesbury. The study indicates that Eilmer likely recognized the comet as the same object he had seen in 989.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it reshapes the timeline of astronomical observations related to Halley's Comet, which was previously linked primarily to the work of English astronomer Edmond Halley in the 17th century. The findings contribute to a better understanding of the comet's historical appearances and their impact on historical events in the British Isles.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Halley's Comet was first recorded by Eilmer of Malmesbury in 1066.</li>
    <li>Previous observations of the comet date back to 989.</li>
    <li>Halley's Comet has been observed in 1531, 1607, and 1682.</li>
    <li>The comet is designated as 1P/Halley.</li>
    <li>The International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) is currently tracking comet 3I/ATLAS.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will approach Earth within 270 million kilometers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In 989, Eilmer of Malmesbury, an English monk, likely observed Halley's Comet for the first time. He recorded his sighting again in 1066. Several centuries later, Edmond Halley confirmed that the comet was the same object seen previously. Halley’s work identified the comet's periodicity, leading to its designation as 1P/Halley.</p>

<p>In subsequent observations, Halley's Comet was noted in 1531, 1607, and 1682, solidifying its place in astronomical history.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The historical context of Halley's Comet adds depth to our understanding of past events and their societal implications,” said Yevhen Ustimenko, a researcher involved in the study.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The appearances of Halley's Comet have historically been associated with significant events, such as the death of kings, wars, or famine in the British Isles. This new study highlights that the comet was observed five times before 1066, suggesting a long history of human observation and interpretation of celestial events.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The International Asteroid Warning Network continues to monitor comet 3I/ATLAS as part of ongoing efforts to improve the measurement of comet and asteroid paths.</p>
