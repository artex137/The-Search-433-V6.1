      <h2>Seeking the Westall UFO ‘truth’</h2>

<p>A researcher has called for a federal inquiry into the Westall UFO incident, which occurred on 6 April 1966 in Melbourne, Australia. More than 200 students and teachers at Westall primary and secondary schools reportedly witnessed up to three unidentified flying objects during broad daylight. Witnesses described fast-moving, shimmering silver objects that flew over the schools and vanished behind trees in The Grange Reserve. Nearly 60 years later, there has been no official account from authorities regarding the incident.</p>

<p>This inquiry aims to bring closure to the incident, which remains one of Australia's best-known UFO mysteries. Grant Lavac, a Melbourne researcher, has initiated a petition for an independent investigation to uncover the truth. Lavac expressed concern for the witnesses, many of whom were children at the time, and emphasized the need to understand what they saw and why they were silenced.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Date:</strong> 6 April 1966</li>
<li><strong>Location:</strong> Westall primary and secondary schools, Melbourne, Australia</li>
<li><strong>Witnesses:</strong> Over 200 students and teachers</li>
<li><strong>Authorities involved:</strong> Army, Air Force, Department of Supply, police</li>
<li><strong>Current status:</strong> Petition for an independent inquiry initiated by Grant Lavac</li>
<li><strong>Documentary:</strong> The Westall Witnesses, produced by Lavac</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 6 April 1966, students and teachers at Westall primary and secondary schools witnessed three unidentified flying objects. The objects were described as fast-moving and shimmering. Following the sighting, army, Air Force, and police officers arrived at the scene, and witnesses reported being instructed not to speak about the event. Over the years, attempts to obtain official records have been met with resistance from the federal defence department.</p>

<p>In recent years, Lavac has interviewed former students for his documentary, which has reignited interest in the incident. His petition for an inquiry has garnered support from other researchers, including Shane Ryan, who has collected over 140 eyewitness accounts.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
“Given that most surviving witnesses involved in the incident are now in their 70s and older, it is time for a concerted effort to be made to bring the truth of the incident, whatever it was, out into the open.” 
— Shane Ryan, academic and researcher
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
“It continues to be a fascinating unsolved cold case that has people asking questions. As a researcher, I feel for the witnesses – for those who were children on the day – and want to know what they saw in the skies and why they were told to shut up about it.”
— Grant Lavac, Melbourne researcher
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The Westall incident is notable for its lack of official documentation and the silence imposed on witnesses. The only newspaper to report on the event was Dandenong Journal, which published an article featuring a student’s sketch of a round object. This article remains one of the Journal’s most sought-after stories, attracting requests for republication from around the world. Interest in the incident has surged in recent years, as many witnesses have come forward to share their accounts.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The petition for an independent inquiry is currently accessible at aph.gov.au/e-petitions/petition/EN7396. Lavac hopes this inquiry will prompt the Department of Defence to reassess its protocols for handling reports of unidentified anomalous phenomena.</p>
