      <h2>NASA releases long-awaited images: mysterious object 3I/ATLAS is not an alien ship, but an interstellar comet</h2>

<p>NASA has released images of the object 3I/ATLAS, confirming it is an interstellar comet and not an alien spacecraft. The images were taken by three Mars probes that came within 18 million miles of the comet.</p>

<p>The release of these images ends speculation about the object’s origins, which first surfaced after its discovery in July. The comet had drawn attention from both the scientific community and the public, including celebrity Kim Kardashian. NASA officials have stated that further analysis of the images will help determine the comet's size and composition.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object name: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Discovered: July 2023</li>
    <li>Distance from Mars during imaging: 18 million miles</li>
    <li>Key instruments used: HiRISE camera, MAVEN spacecraft, Perseverance rover</li>
    <li>Resolution of key image: 30 kilometers per pixel</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2023. Since then, it has sparked significant debate regarding its nature, with some experts suggesting it could be an extraterrestrial spacecraft. NASA's Mars probes captured images of the comet, which were released on a recent date, confirming it as a comet and not a technological object.</p>

<p>NASA utilized the HiRISE camera to capture images that show the comet as a faint, fuzzy ball, while MAVEN provided ultraviolet images to identify molecules released by the comet. The Perseverance rover also managed to take an image through long exposure techniques.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "We really want to find signs of life in the universe... but 3I/ATLAS is a comet," said Amit Kshatriya, a senior NASA official, during a press conference.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    "It is very dangerous and misleading to place speculation over the scientific process. All the facts, without exception, indicate that this is a normal object coming from interstellar space towards us," said Thomas Puzia, an astrophysicist and leader of the team that discovered the object.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “Of course it could be natural,” said Harvard professor Avi Loeb. “But we also have to consider the possibility that it could be technological, because if it is, then the consequences for humanity would be colossal.”
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The discovery of 3I/ATLAS has generated significant public interest and debate. While many scientists have affirmed its natural origin, others have speculated about its potential as a technological object. This discussion reflects ongoing curiosity about interstellar phenomena and the search for extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Nasa plans to conduct further analysis of the images to learn more about the comet's nucleus and its composition. The results may provide additional insights into interstellar objects and their characteristics.</p>
