      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS passes safely through the Solar System</h2>

<p>An interstellar comet, designated 3I/ATLAS, has safely passed through the Solar System, making its closest approach to Earth at approximately 1 a.m. EST on 19th December 2025. The comet, discovered on 1st July 2025 by NASA’s ATLAS survey telescope in Chile, came within about 168 million miles (270 million kilometres) of Earth, which is more than 700 times the distance between Earth and the Moon. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this event.</p>

<p>The passage of 3I/ATLAS presents a rare scientific opportunity for astronomers to study material from beyond our Solar System. NASA has confirmed that there is no risk of impact with Earth. Observers have been encouraged to view the comet through telescopes at local observatories or star-watching events. The Virtual Telescope Project has also planned a free livestream from Manciano, Italy, beginning at 11 p.m. ET on 19th December, contingent on weather conditions.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered on 1st July 2025.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth occurred at approximately 1 a.m. EST on 19th December 2025.</li>
    <li>The comet passed at a distance of about 168 million miles (270 million kilometres).</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS is the third confirmed interstellar object after 1I/’Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov.</li>
    <li>The comet will exit the Solar System permanently after its passage.</li>
    <li>It reached perihelion on 30th October, passing inside Mars’s orbit.</li>
    <li>Its trajectory is hyperbolic, moving too fast to be captured by the Sun’s gravity.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS entered the inner Solar System from the direction of Sagittarius, likely formed around another star. It reached perihelion on 30th October 2025, coming within 130 million miles of the Sun. After passing behind the Sun, it re-emerged in early December.</p>
<p>The comet made its closest approach to Earth on 19th December 2025, providing a unique opportunity for observation. As it continues on its hyperbolic trajectory, it will exit the Solar System forever.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“NASA has stressed there is no danger of impact,” said a spokesperson from the agency. “The object looks and behaves exactly like a comet.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence,” remarked an astronomer involved in the observations. “Researchers have found no robust evidence of unusual behaviour.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable as only the third confirmed interstellar object, following 1I/’Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Its passage offers a rare glimpse into the chemistry and dynamics of comets from beyond our Solar System, contributing to a better understanding of the formation of distant planetary systems.</p>
<p>Despite occasional sensational claims surrounding such objects, US and European space agencies have consistently reported that 3I/ATLAS is a natural comet composed chiefly of ices, including water and carbon dioxide.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As Comet 3I/ATLAS continues its journey, astronomers will analyze data collected during its passage to refine their understanding of interstellar objects and comet chemistry. There are no anticipated investigations or charges related to the event.</p>
