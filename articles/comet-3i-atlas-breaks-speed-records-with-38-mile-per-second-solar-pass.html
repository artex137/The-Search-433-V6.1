      <h2>Comet 3I/Atlas breaks speed records with 38-mile-per-second solar pass</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/Atlas, the third confirmed interstellar object to enter the Solar System, achieved perihelion last week, reaching a speed of 38 miles per second (61 kilometers per second) while maintaining a distance of 127 million miles (204 million kilometers) from the Sun, according to <em>Agora CNN</em>.</p>

<p>This record-setting speed is significant for scientists studying the formation of planetary systems. Emerson Roberto Perez, an astronomer at the Urânia Planetarium, stated that the comet's unique characteristics provide a rare opportunity to explore interstellar material. NASA's Clipper probe will pass through the comet's tail in December, marking a historic moment for space exploration.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/Atlas reached perihelion last week.</li>
    <li>It travels at a speed of 38 miles per second (61 kilometers per second).</li>
    <li>The comet is approximately 127 million miles (204 million kilometers) from the Sun.</li>
    <li>Its estimated age is between 5 to 7 billion years.</li>
    <li>The nearest point to Earth will occur on December 19, at 1.8 astronomical units (approximately 168 million miles or 270 million kilometers).</li>
    <li>Nasa's Clipper probe will collect and analyze material from the comet's tail in December.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/Atlas entered the Solar System as the third confirmed interstellar object. Last week, it reached perihelion, traveling at a record speed of 38 miles per second. The comet will make its closest approach to Earth on December 19, which is approximately 168 million miles away. In December, NASA's Clipper probe will encounter the comet's tail for the first time.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    "Its dense structure and distant origin offer a unique opportunity to study the formation of other planetary systems," said Emerson Roberto Perez, as reported by <em>Agora CNN</em>.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/Atlas is notable for its age and speed, providing insights into the early formation of the Solar System. Its composition differs from that of comets formed within the Solar System, which adds to its scientific value. The approaching encounter with NASA's Clipper probe will enhance our understanding of interstellar materials.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA's Clipper probe is set to pass through the comet's tail in December, allowing for the first-ever collection and analysis of interstellar material. This event is expected to yield valuable data on the formation of planetary systems.</p>
