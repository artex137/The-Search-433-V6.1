      <h2>NASA drops 3I/ATLAS 'spaceship' bombshell in major comet update as new images released</h2>

<p>NASA has provided a significant update on the mystery comet 3I/ATLAS during a press conference held on November 19. The agency released new images of the comet, which some experts speculate could be an alien spacecraft, through a broadcast on its website and YouTube channel.</p>

<p>This update is crucial as it addresses public interest and concern regarding the comet, which is travelling through the Solar System at a speed of 130,000 mph. NASA has confirmed the object as an interstellar comet, and experts continue to analyze its characteristics and trajectory.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event: NASA press conference on comet 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Date: November 19, 2023</li>
    <li>Speed of comet: 130,000 mph (209,215 km/h)</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: 170 million miles (273 million kilometres)</li>
    <li>Previous government shutdown: October 1 to November 12, 2023</li>
    <li>Confirmed as interstellar object: June 2023</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In early June 2023, scientists confirmed 3I/ATLAS as an interstellar object. Following this, NASA and other observatories began collecting data using advanced telescopes. On October 1, the U.S. government entered a shutdown, which affected NASA's operations. The shutdown ended on November 12, allowing NASA to resume public communication and data sharing.</p>
<p>On November 19, NASA held a press conference where they revealed new images of the comet taken from the Mars rover, marking the first time the public could view these images.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb, theoretical physicist, suggested, "The anomalies suggest it might be an extraterrestrial spaceship. The behaviour has been so odd I will never be able to rule out the possibility it is an alien craft."</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loeb also stated, "On my UFO scale, 3I/ATLAS would always at least be a two—an object meriting attention."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This update follows a period of heightened interest in 3I/ATLAS, especially after the comet's trajectory brought it back into view after a slingshot around the sun. The comet's unusual characteristics have led to speculation about its origin, with some experts suggesting it could be more than just a comet.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and various observatories will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth next month. The comet is also expected to make a close pass by Jupiter early next year, providing further opportunities for observations before it exits the Solar System.</p>
