      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Makes Closest Approach to Earth</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has made its closest approach to Earth today, December 19, 2025, passing within 168 million miles (270 million kilometers) of the planet at approximately 1 a.m. EST (0600 GMT). There have been no reports of injuries or fatalities related to this event.</p>

<p>This close flyby is significant as it provides scientists with a unique opportunity to study a comet from beyond our solar system. Authorities and astronomers are actively monitoring the comet's trajectory as it continues its journey through the outer solar system, with plans to observe its passing of Jupiter in early 2026.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Closest approach occurred at 1 a.m. EST (0600 GMT) on December 19, 2025.</li>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS passed within 168 million miles (270 million kilometers) of Earth.</li>
    <li>The comet is traveling at approximately 148,600 miles per hour (239,200 km/h).</li>
    <li>It was discovered on July 1, 2025.</li>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar comet.</li>
    <li>Live coverage of the comet's flyby is available through the Virtual Telescope Project.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered. It made its closest approach to the Sun in October 2025. The comet reached a distance of 166.8 million miles (286.5 million kilometers) from Earth as of 12:08 a.m. EST on December 19, 2025. Its closest approach occurred at 1 a.m. EST (0600 GMT) on the same day.</p>

<p>Live coverage of the comet was scheduled to be hosted by Gianluca Masi of the Virtual Telescope Project but was postponed due to rain at the observing site in Ceccano, Italy. The livestream is now set to begin at 11 p.m. EST (0400 GMT) on December 19, 2025, weather permitting.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Because of rain, this event has been postponed,” said Gianluca Masi regarding the livestream of comet 3I/ATLAS.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “We’re excited that this opportunity to view another target on the way to Jupiter was completely unexpected,” said Kurt Retherford, principal investigator for the Europa-UVS instrument, referring to observations made by NASA's Europa Clipper spacecraft.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar comet, following 2017's 1I/'Oumuamua and 2019's 2I/Borisov. Scientists have tracked its path to understand how it differs from other comets within the solar system.</p>

<p>The comet will continue its journey, crossing the orbits of Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune by 2028 before heading out into interstellar space.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As comet 3I/ATLAS continues its trajectory, scientists will analyze data collected during its close approach. Observations will help improve understanding of interstellar objects and their characteristics. The livestream scheduled for later tonight will allow further public engagement with this astronomical event.</p>
