      <h2>Does 3I/ATLAS pose a threat to Earth? Potential Alien intrusion claim debunked</h2>

<p>3I/ATLAS, an interstellar comet, has been confirmed to pose no threat to Earth as it approaches its closest pass around December 19, 2025, at a distance of about 1.8 astronomical units, according to NASA and ESA teams. The comet reached perihelion near October 29 to 30, at approximately 1.36 to 1.4 astronomical units from the Sun, remaining hundreds of millions of kilometers away from Earth at all times.</p>

<p>This information is significant for both scientists and the public, as it clarifies misconceptions about the comet's potential hazards. Authorities are currently treating 3I/ATLAS as a unique object for study rather than a cause for alarm. The International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) is preparing a comet astrometry campaign from November 27, 2025, to January 27, 2026, to practice tracking methods across observatories.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Closest pass: December 19, 2025, at approximately 1.8 astronomical units.</li>
    <li>Perihelion date: October 29-30, 2025, at about 1.36 to 1.4 astronomical units from the Sun.</li>
    <li>Estimated speed near perihelion: 320,000 km/h (200,000 mph).</li>
    <li>Discovery date: July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS survey in Chile.</li>
    <li>IAWN comet astrometry campaign: November 27, 2025, to January 27, 2026.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, 2025, 3I/ATLAS was first reported by the ATLAS survey from Chile. Following its discovery, it was confirmed as an interstellar object by orbital solutions submitted to the Minor Planet Center. By early October, reports from AP and Reuters emphasized its interstellar status and confirmed it posed no threat to Earth.</p>

<p>As perihelion approached, scientists noted unusual characteristics of the comet, including strong atomic nickel signals detected through spectroscopy. The comet's behavior has aligned with expected patterns for active comets, with observations confirming the presence of a coma and tail. The IAWN announced the upcoming comet astrometry campaign in October 2025 to enhance tracking capabilities.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “The International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) announces a comet campaign from November 27, 2025, through January 27, 2026, to introduce methods for improving astrometry from comet observations,” the network stated in October 2025.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “It poses no danger to Earth, coming no closer than 150 million miles (240 million km), which is more than 1.5 astronomical units,” according to an EarthSky report dated October 21, 2025.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to this event, there have been other interstellar objects detected, but 3I/ATLAS is noted as the largest observed to date. The scientific community is focused on its physics and chemistry, particularly the unusual nickel-to-iron ratio identified in its gas phase. This finding has led to hypotheses regarding its composition and the natural pathways that may explain its characteristics.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its trajectory, scientists will conduct further observations and analyses, particularly during its closest approach in December 2025. The IAWN's comet astrometry campaign aims to enhance the observational skills of astronomers and improve future predictions regarding comet behavior.</p>
