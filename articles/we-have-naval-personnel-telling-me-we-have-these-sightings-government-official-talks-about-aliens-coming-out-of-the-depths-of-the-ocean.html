      <h2>Government Official Talks About Aliens Coming Out Of The Depths Of The Ocean</h2>

<p>Tennessee Representative Tim Burchett has claimed that unidentified entities may reside in Earth’s oceans during a video posted on September 17, 2025. Burchett stated that these entities could be coming from deep water areas, raising questions about their existence and potential sightings reported by naval personnel.</p>

<p>This statement has gained attention due to the implications it carries regarding unidentified aerial phenomena and the lack of comprehensive understanding of oceanic environments. Authorities are now considering the need for further investigation into these claims and the reported sightings of underwater craft.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Representative Tim Burchett made the claims on September 17, 2025.</li>
    <li>The video was posted on social media platform X.</li>
    <li>Burchett referenced five or six deep water areas with high sighting frequencies.</li>
    <li>He mentioned that these underwater craft travel at speeds of hundreds of miles per hour.</li>
    <li>Burchett noted that current human-made vehicles can only reach speeds under 40 miles per hour.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On September 17, 2025, Representative Tim Burchett shared a video on X discussing the possibility of alien entities residing in Earth's oceans. He emphasized the lack of knowledge about oceanic environments compared to space exploration. Burchett also referenced reports from naval personnel regarding sightings of unidentified underwater craft.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“What if, these are entities that are here on this earth, that have been on this earth for who knows how long, and we think they’re coming from way out,” Burchett said in the video.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Like we say, we know more about the face of the Moon than we know what’s going on there [the ocean],” he added.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“We have a higher propensity of sightings around these five or six — I believe — deep water areas. It creates a question there,” Burchett stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Burchett's comments come amid ongoing discussions about unidentified aerial phenomena and the government's transparency regarding such incidents. Previous incidents involving UFO sightings have prompted calls for more rigorous investigation and documentation from federal agencies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Authorities are expected to explore Burchett's claims further, particularly regarding the reported sightings by naval personnel and the implications for understanding oceanic phenomena. Investigations into these underwater sightings may be initiated as a result of this renewed interest.</p>
