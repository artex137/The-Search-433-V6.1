      <h2>NASA’s silence fuels fake viral 3I/ATLAS photos</h2>

<p>Social media users have circulated unverified photos and videos claiming to show the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, drawing millions of views this week. NASA has not confirmed or denied the authenticity of these visuals, which depict an elongated, spacecraft-like object surrounded by a glowing dust halo.</p>

<p>This surge of interest in 3I/ATLAS comes after its discovery earlier this year. Experts warn that the lack of official communication from NASA has led to rampant speculation and misinformation. Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has urged NASA to release verified images of the comet taken by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, but has received no response.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS is believed to be over 7 billion years old.</li>
    <li>It is the third known interstellar object to pass through the solar system.</li>
    <li>NASA has made no official comment regarding the authenticity of the circulating images.</li>
    <li>Social media posts claim the images were captured by the Hubble Space Telescope and from Japanese scientists; neither has been verified.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb has requested legitimate images from NASA, specifically from early October.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Earlier this year, 3I/ATLAS was discovered, generating significant public interest due to its unusual brightness and changing color.</p>
<p>This week, photos and videos claiming to depict the comet began circulating on social media, drawing millions of views.</p>
<p>NASA has not issued any statements to confirm or deny the authenticity of these visuals, leading to speculation among users about the agency's silence.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“When official data stops flowing, speculation moves faster than science,” one astronomer told WION.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The situation highlights the challenges of misinformation in the digital age. In the absence of transparent communication from space agencies, false narratives can easily proliferate, especially about events as rare as the passage of an interstellar comet.</p>
<p>Public interest in 3I/ATLAS has surged since it was first discovered, creating a fertile ground for conspiracy theories and digital fabrications.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Experts suggest that NASA and other space agencies should release verified data and images more promptly to counter misinformation. Until then, speculation and viral posts are likely to dominate public perception of 3I/ATLAS.</p>
