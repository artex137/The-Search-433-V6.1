      <h2>This Bizarre Comet Has Our Most Powerful Telescopes Completely Stumped</h2>

<p>Scientists have discovered an interstellar object named 3I/ATLAS, which is moving through the solar system in an unusual manner. First spotted in July 2025, NASA has begun monitoring the object due to its unexpected behavior, according to Science Alert.</p>

<p>This finding is significant as it challenges existing knowledge about comets. Four major space observatories, including NASA’s Hubble, TESS, SPHEREx, and the James Webb Space Telescope, are currently observing 3I/ATLAS to learn more about its unique characteristics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was first observed in July 2025.</li>
    <li>The object is currently being monitored by NASA and other space observatories.</li>
    <li>TESS detected it from six astronomical units away, farther than Jupiter.</li>
    <li>It exhibits the highest carbon dioxide-to-water ratio ever recorded in a comet.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS will make flybys past Mars, Venus, and Jupiter before exiting the solar system.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was initially detected in July 2025. Since then, multiple space observatories have focused on studying its properties. Observations revealed that it behaves differently from typical comets, prompting scientists to investigate its composition and origin.</p>

<p>As of now, NASA's Juno and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter may attempt to capture closer images of 3I/ATLAS during its journey through the solar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It’s somewhat like a comet, but not entirely,” said an unnamed NASA source regarding the unique characteristics of 3I/ATLAS.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The object has more of a ‘teardrop-shaped cocoon’ of dust than a distinct comet tail,” noted observers using the Hubble telescope.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Prior to this discovery, comets have generally been characterized by certain predictable behaviors and compositions. The unusual findings associated with 3I/ATLAS may lead to new insights into the formation and behavior of interstellar objects.</p>

<p>Avi Loeb, a Harvard astronomer, has even suggested that the object could be a probe from another civilization, highlighting the ongoing debate about extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and other agencies will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches its flybys. Observations may provide further insights into its composition and behavior before it leaves the solar system.</p>
