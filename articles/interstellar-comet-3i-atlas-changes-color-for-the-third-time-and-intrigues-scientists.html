      <h2>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS changes color for the third time and intrigues scientists</h2>

<p>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has exhibited a bluish hue in recent observations, marking its third color change since its discovery in July 2025. The phenomenon occurred after perihelion, the point of closest approach to the Sun, on October 29, at a distance of 130 million kilometers from Earth.</p>

<p>This color change is significant as it suggests the release of gases such as carbon monoxide or ammonia from the comet's icy nucleus. Researchers have detected the change using data from spacecraft, highlighting the need for further study to understand the comet's behavior and composition.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered: July 2025</li>
    <li>Recent color change observed: October 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth at perihelion: 130 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Upcoming closest approach to Earth: December 19, 2025, at 168 million kilometers</li>
    <li>Comet speed: 130,000 km/h</li>
    <li>Visibility in Northern Hemisphere: Until the end of 2025, requiring telescopes or long-range binoculars</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first identified in July 2025, displaying a red hue attributed to dust on its surface. In September, the comet changed to a green hue, indicating the presence of dicarbon or cyanide. The latest bluish color was observed in October, following its perihelion.</p>
<p>The comet passed close to Mars in October and is expected to approach Earth in December 2025, providing an opportunity for further observations and analysis.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The bluish color indicates the release of volatile gases from the comet's icy nucleus. This change is unusual and requires further study,” said a researcher involved in the observations.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is one of the oldest interstellar objects ever observed, believed to have originated from a stellar system approximately 7 billion years ago. Its unique characteristics, such as high emissions of carbon dioxide and water, set it apart from typical comets.</p>
<p>The scientific community is particularly interested in this comet as it offers a rare opportunity to study materials from other stellar systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to use data from ground-based and space-based observatories to further analyze 3I/ATLAS's chemical composition. Observations will continue until the end of 2025, which will be crucial in understanding the comet's characteristics and the implications of its color changes.</p>
