      <h2>Mysterious sphere sparks global debate over possible UFO</h2>

<p>A metallic sphere discovered in Buga, Colombia, has ignited renewed speculation about unidentified flying objects (UFOs) since its sighting on March 2, 2025. The object reportedly landed in the town, drawing significant attention from both the public and scientists.</p>

<p>The discovery has prompted researchers, including Jose Luis Velazquez, to examine the sphere closely. Velazquez has noted that the object consists of three layers and lacks the welds or joints typically found in manufactured items, leading him to suggest it may be of extraterrestrial origin. However, not all experts share this view, and ongoing discussions highlight the need for further investigation.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Date of sighting: March 2, 2025</li>
    <li>Location: Buga, Colombia</li>
    <li>Examining researcher: Jose Luis Velazquez</li>
    <li>Expert opinion: Julia Mossbridge</li>
    <li>Organizations involved: Scientific Coalition for UAP Studies, UAP Disclosure Fund, Galileo Project</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On March 2, 2025, a metallic sphere was observed flying over Buga, Colombia. Following its landing, social media accounts, including @Truthpolex, shared information about the object, prompting widespread interest.</p>
<p>In the days that followed, researchers began to study the sphere. Jose Luis Velazquez noted its unusual characteristics, while Julia Mossbridge expressed skepticism regarding its origin, suggesting it may not be a UFO.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We are learning that we don’t fully understand what’s in our skies or our waters,” said Julia Mossbridge, emphasizing the need for careful examination of such discoveries.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Before calling anything a UFO, the object should be examined by experts,” Mossbridge added, advocating for involvement from specialized teams like the Galileo Project.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Reports of unidentified flying objects have been ongoing, with the federal government acknowledging the existence of unexplainable phenomena in the sky. This has led to the formation of various research groups focused on studying such occurrences, including the Scientific Coalition for UAP Studies and the Galileo Project.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As the debate surrounding the Colombian sphere continues, further examinations by experts will determine its origin and characteristics. The involvement of international research teams may help establish clearer guidelines for studying similar findings in the future.</p>
