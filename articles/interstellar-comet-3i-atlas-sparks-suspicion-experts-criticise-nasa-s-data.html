      <h2>Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Sparks Suspicion, Experts Criticise NASA's Data</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has drawn skepticism from experts following the release of NASA's high-resolution images on November 15, 2025. The images, intended to provide clarity on the comet, instead sparked confusion and criticism, with observers calling the visuals inadequate and unclear.</p>

<p>This situation matters because it highlights ongoing debates about the nature of 3I/ATLAS and raises questions regarding the transparency of NASA's findings. Critics argue that the agency may be withholding important data that could clarify the comet's origins and characteristics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025.</li>
    <li>NASA released images of the comet on November 15, 2025.</li>
    <li>Images were described as "fuzzy white dots" and "pixelated smudges."</li>
    <li>Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb has expressed concerns over NASA's data release.</li>
    <li>Indian scientists from ISRO observed 3I/ATLAS between November 12 and 15, 2025.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025, becoming the third known interstellar object to enter the solar system. On November 15, 2025, NASA released images that were met with public disappointment, described as lacking detail. Critics, including Avi Loeb, voiced their concerns about the inadequacy of the data and the potential implications for understanding the comet's nature.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, from November 12 to 15, 2025, scientists from the Physical Research Laboratory in India conducted their observations of the comet, capturing images that provided a different perspective on its characteristics.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated that NASA was "pretending to be the adults in the room" while offering no new insights and effectively "gatekeeping" the raw data that could prove the object's artificial origins.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>This incident reflects a broader trend of skepticism towards NASA's data releases concerning interstellar objects. The debate around 3I/ATLAS echoes previous discussions about other celestial phenomena and the agency's transparency in scientific reporting.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Investigations into the characteristics of 3I/ATLAS are ongoing. The scientific community will continue to analyze data from various sources, including the observations made by Indian scientists, to better understand the comet and its implications for our knowledge of interstellar objects.</p>
