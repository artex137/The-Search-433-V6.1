      <h2>Defense experts, lawmakers call for more serious UFO research</h2>

<p>Japanese lawmakers and security experts have called for enhanced research into unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) following recent sightings near sensitive sites, including nuclear power plants. The push for more serious investigation comes after a closed-door meeting held on August 7, 2023, in Tokyo, where lawmakers discussed the implications of UAP on national security.</p>

<p>This matter has gained urgency as Japan recognizes the potential threats posed by UAP, which are increasingly viewed as manmade objects rather than extraterrestrial entities. The Japanese government is responding to these concerns by holding hearings and considering the establishment of dedicated units to monitor and analyze UAP.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event Date: August 7, 2023</li>
    <li>Location: Tokyo, Japan</li>
    <li>Notable Sightings: Three drone-like lights above Genkai Nuclear Power Station in Saga Prefecture</li>
    <li>Recent Reports: Multiple sightings of UAP near nuclear facilities</li>
    <li>Official Meetings: Hearings held with officials from the Nuclear Regulation Authority, Defense Ministry, and land ministry</li>
    <li>Legislative Action: Formation of a parliamentary group to analyze UAP</li>
    <li>International Context: U.S. military's engagement with UAP and similar incidents involving surveillance balloons</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In late July 2023, four security guards at Genkai Nuclear Power Station reported seeing three unidentified lights in the sky. Despite extensive searches, no physical drones were found. This incident prompted lawmakers to convene in a closed-door meeting on August 7, 2023, to discuss the implications for national security.</p>

<p>In June 2024, a parliamentary group was established to focus on UAP from a security perspective, holding two meetings and inviting U.S. policymakers to share insights. The group has since urged the Defense Ministry to create a dedicated unit for UAP monitoring.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“If we cannot identify what it is, it’s impossible to determine whether the Defense Ministry or the National Police Agency should handle it,” said Yasukazu Hamada, a member of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and former defense minister.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“There may still be many unidentified flying objects from other countries that we have not yet been able to detect technologically,” a senior Defense Ministry official stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Japan has reported similar incidents involving unidentified balloon-like objects, suspected of being used for reconnaissance, between 2019 and 2021. In response to these incidents, Japan has relaxed the rules governing the use of weapons to intercept objects in national airspace.</p>

<p>Internationally, UAP have been recognized as a security issue. The U.S. Department of Defense formed the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) in 2022 to investigate UAP threats. AARO concluded that many UAP sightings since the 1940s were likely misidentified technologies rather than extraterrestrial in nature.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Japan's government is expected to continue its investigations into UAP, with potential developments including the establishment of dedicated research units and ongoing hearings to assess the national security implications of these phenomena.</p>
