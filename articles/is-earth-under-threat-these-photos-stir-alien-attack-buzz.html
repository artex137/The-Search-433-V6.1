      <h2>Is Earth Under Threat? These Photos Stir Alien Attack Buzz</h2>

<p>A mysterious object, 3I/ATLAS, is speeding towards our solar system at 60 km/s, raising questions about its nature as either a comet or an alien spacecraft. Spotted by Chile's ATLAS telescope on July 1, 2023, 3I/ATLAS measures between 10 and 20 km in diameter. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This situation has garnered attention as researchers from Harvard University suggest it might be an alien craft, warning of a possible November attack, although most experts dismiss it as merely a comet. NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) have classified 3I/ATLAS as a comet, stating it poses no threat at its current distance of 270 million km from Earth.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Speed: 60 km/s</li>
    <li>Size: 10-20 km in diameter</li>
    <li>Discovered: July 1, 2023, by ATLAS telescope in Chile</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun: Late November 2023</li>
    <li>Perihelion date: October 30, 2025</li>
    <li>Distance from Earth: 270 million km</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first spotted by the ATLAS telescope in Chile on July 1, 2023. Researchers have since debated its classification, with Harvard's Avi Loeb suggesting it could be an alien craft. NASA and ESA have maintained that it is a comet. The object will reach its closest point to the Sun in late November 2023.</p>
<p>By October 30, 2025, 3I/ATLAS will hit perihelion, becoming less visible from Earth. Observations from the Hubble and James Webb telescopes will continue to track its icy glow, providing more data by December 2025 to clarify its true nature.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“3I/ATLAS is classified as a comet by NASA, and its icy coma poses no threat at this distance,” said a spokesperson from NASA.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb from Harvard University stated, “If 3I/ATLAS is indeed an alien ship, our rockets cannot match its speed.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Chris Lintott from Oxford University criticized the alien theory as “nonsense,” but emphasized the need for more data to understand 3I/ATLAS.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The debate over the nature of 3I/ATLAS has drawn comparisons to the 2017 incident involving Oumuamua, another object that sparked speculation about extraterrestrial life. While some researchers advocate for further investigation into cosmic threats, others warn against baseless claims.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>NASA and ESA will continue monitoring 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun. More data is expected by December 2025, which will help clarify whether 3I/ATLAS is a comet or something more unusual.</p>
