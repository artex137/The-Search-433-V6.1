      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Sparks Interest Among Space Enthusiasts</h2>

<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, discovered by Chile's ATLAS telescope, has garnered attention as it zooms past the Sun on 29 October 2025. This interstellar comet, believed to be between 3 and 14 billion years old, is a significant find for scientists studying the formation of planets beyond our Solar System.</p>

<p>The comet's unique properties make it a valuable subject of study. Authorities and astronomers are closely monitoring its trajectory and composition, as it offers insights into the materials that existed in the early universe. The comet is expected to depart from Earth's vicinity in December 2025, heading back into deep space.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered on 1 July 2025 by ATLAS telescope in Chile.</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the Sun occurred on 29 October 2025, approximately 126 million miles away.</li>
    <li>Comet's nucleus is less than 1.6 kilometres across and spins every 16 hours.</li>
    <li>Water vapour is ejected at a rate of 6.6 kg/second; carbon dioxide at 129 kg/second.</li>
    <li>Expected to pass Earth at a distance of about 54 million miles in December 2025.</li>
    <li>Comet is likely 7–10 billion years old, making it the oldest comet observed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS was first identified on 1 July 2025, when astronomers noticed its activity. By mid-July, it was confirmed to be an interstellar object due to its high velocity. The comet made its closest approach to the Sun on 29 October 2025 and is set to pass Earth in December 2025 before continuing its journey into deep space.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The fact that 3I/ATLAS is older than our entire solar system genuinely blows my mind,” said an enthusiastic space observer. “It could just be a random comet passing by, but it’s been wandering space since before the Sun even existed.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar comet observed in our Solar System. Previous discoveries of interstellar objects have provided valuable information about the materials and processes occurring in other star systems. This comet's unique composition may shed light on different planetary formation scenarios.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Astronomers will continue to observe Comet 3I/ATLAS as it approaches Earth. They aim to gather more data on its composition and behavior before it fades from view, potentially revealing new insights about the formation of celestial bodies in the universe.</p>
